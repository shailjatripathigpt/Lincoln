The flag of Freedom floats on the State\n\nCapitol, and every man elected to the State Department. (Loud cheers.)

Hon.Abram LincolnofSpringfield, amid most deafening cheers, arose to reply to this toast.He said he could most heartily indorse the sentiment expressed in the toast. During the whole canvass we had been assailed\n\nas the enemies of the Union,4and he often had occasion to repudiate the sentiments attributed to us. He said\n\nthat theRepublican partywas the friend of the Union.5(Cheers.)It was the friends of the Union now; and if it had been entirely snccessful, it would have been the friend of the Union more than ever.(Loud and long continued cheers.)He maintained that the Liberty for which we contended could best be obtained by a\n\nfirm, a steady adherence to the Union. AsWebstersaid, “Not Union without liberty, nor liberty without Union; but Union and liberty, now and\n\nforever, one and inseparable.”6(Loud cheers.)

It is now the duty of those elected to give us a good Republican\n\nAdministration. In regard to the Governor-elect,Col.

The discussion opened the eyes of those who had been drawn into the lodges.

Mr.Trumbullmoved to lay the amendment upon the table; which was agreed to, ayes 40, noes 39. Mr.Hardinmoved to amend the bill by adding two additional sections, providing that an additional\n\none tenth of one per cent. should be collected and paid into the State Treasury, to\n\nbe pledged and applied to the payment of interest on the bonds hereby hypothecated,\n\nand those heretofore sold; and restricting the counties to 50 cents on the one hundred\n\ndollars to be levied for county purposes. Mr.Hardinsaid he was anxious to test the sense of theHouse, on the measure proposed in the amendment—that of a direct tax. He was for adopting\n\nsome permanent measure for the payment of this interest.—We had been together for\n\nnear three weeks, and notwithstanding theGovernor, had told us, that this was the only democratic mode of raising a tax, yet we had\n\nheard nothing from the dominant party in this House, or from the finance committee\n\non this subject. If this bill passed as proposed by the committee he thought it highly\n\nproblematical, whether any permanent measure would be adopted whatever. The next\n\nstep would be to hypothecate bonds to pay our July and next January interest, which\n\ninterest amounted to about $300,000, and for which about $600,000 in bonds must be\n\nhypothecated, and these bonds would eventually become forfeited and be sold for 40\n\nor 50 cents on the dollar. Were gentlemen determined to pursue this ruinous policy,\n\nrather than take the responsibility of coming up to the question of a direct tax?\n\nWe were chosen to represent the interests and honor of theStatefor two years, and we should ma",

It was clear, logical, argumentative, eloquent, powerful\n\nand convincing. In a most able manner did Mr. Lincoln clear up and refute the charges\n\nthat he was anAbolitionistand an Amalgamationist, and in favor of placing negroes upon a social and political\n\nquality with the whites.3He asserted positively, and proved conclusively by his former acts and speeches\n\nthat he was not in favor of interfering with slavery in the States where it exists,\n\nnor ever had been. That he was not even in favor of abolishing slavery in theDistrict of Columbia, unless a majority of the people of the District should be in favor of it, and remuneration\n\nshould be made to masters who might be unwilling to give up their slaves without compensation;\n\nand even then he would want it done gradually.4He also showed clearly, what nobody but theDemocratsdeny, that slavery is a great moral, social, and political evil, and was so looked\n\nupon by all the fathers of the Government—that the institution was considered a foul\n\nblot on the Nation, which would at some future day be removed. Mr. Lincoln said he\n\nhad always believed as the fathers did, that it would in the course of time be entirely\n\nremoved from our country, until the new policy of nationalizing it had been set on\n\nfoot.—5Since that time he had believed it would either become alike lawful in all the States,\n\nor that eventually, in God’s own good time and way, it would finally disappear. But\n\nwhether it should ever become extinct or not, he was in favor of living up to all\n\nthe guarantees of the Constitution. Whatever constitutional rights the slaveholders\n\nmight have, he was in favor of protecting them. On the other hand, he was opposed to the new doctrine that the Constit",

The cases will be\n\nfiercely contested at all points– Among other things, we shall be obliged to prove\n\nthat thecallsfor instalments were made by the Directors under the 14thSection of the charter.3This proof we can not legally make without theproductionof the Book or Books, in which the orders for these calls are entered. Knowing the inconvenience of producing these Books I have strug^g^led hard to convince myself that we could in some way dispense with them, but in vain.\n\nThe Booksmustbe here, together with some person, or deposition to certify them as\n\nthe Books of the Company. OurCourt, at which these cases stand for trial, commences its term on Monday\n\nthe 17thof March next. Now what I wish is, that you will\n\nput that Book in your trunk, and bring it here to court.

The\n\nhistory of your family, as you give it, is precisely what I have always heard, and\n\npartly know, of my own. As you have supposed, I am the grandson of your uncle,Abra, and the story of his death by the Indians, and ofUncle Mordecai, then fourteen fourteen years old, killing one of the Indians, is the legend most prominent of3all others imprinted upon my mind and memory.4I am the son ofgrandfather’s youngest son,Thomas. I have often heard my father speak of hisUncle Isaac, residing on the5Watauga(I think), near where the then states ofVirginia,North Carolina, andTennesseejoin. You seem now to be some hundred miles or so west of there6. I often saw Uncle Mordecai andUncle Josiah, but never in my life lived near either of them.7Uncle Mordecai died in 1831 or 1832 inHancock county, Ill., where he had then recently removed fromKentucky, and where his children had also removed, and still live8, as I understand.9 Whether Uncle Josiah is dead or living, I cannot tell, not having heard from him for\n\nmore than twenty years. When I last heard from him10he was living onBig Blue river,Hancock county, Ind.11, I think, and where he has resided ever since the beginning12of my recollection.13My father, Thomas, died the 17th of January, 1851, inColes county, Ill., where he had resided 20 years. I am his only child.14I have resided here and hereabouts 23 years. I am 45 years of age, and have awifeand three children, theoldest11 years.15Mywifewas born and raised atLexington, Ky., and my connection with her has sometimes takes me there, where I have heard the old16people of her relatives17speak of yourUncle Thomasand family18.

About the first hour of his speech was taken up with\n\nlittlesharpsonDouglas, calculated to tickle the fancy of the Republicans. He referred to the speech made\n\nby Douglas last week, in which he was charged with being the attorney of theIllinois Central Railroad, at the time the charter was granted, to make a good bargain for thecompanyagainst theState—and as having induced thelegislatureto change the per centage from fifteen to seven per cent. He didn’t deny the charge that he was then or is now the attorney of therailroad, or that he is to-day receiving a big fee from that company as their attorney.3He referred to the bargain between himself andTrumbullto Abolitionize the old lineWhigsandDemocrats, and said it was none of Douglas’ business how he and Trumbull “managed their own domestic concerns.”4He referred to theMexican war, while he was incongressgiving aid and comfort to the enemy, and against his own country, pronouncing it\n\nunholy, unconstitutional, God abhorred, and not begun on the right “spot.”5—This portion of his speech he made as clear as mud. He then harped on the resolutions\n\nread atOttawaby Douglas as a forgery because they were not adopted on the right “spot,” but never once said a word about the revolutionary heresies they contained.6He harped over the conspiracy entered, into by Douglas and theSupreme Court,7the submission clause in theToombsbill,8&c, &c, all of which have been and clinched as lies by Douglas time and again. His whole speech was a personal\n\nattack on Douglas and Democrats. He dodged the issues before the people, and failed\n\nentirely to discuss the principles dividing the two parties.

His main purpose\n\nwas to show that the peace and prosperity of the country, and the limitation of slavery\n\ndepended upon the election of a WhigCongressandGen. Taylor; that theOld Hero, whose fidelity to whig principles none should now doubt, had pledged himself to\n\ncarry out the will of the people, through their representatives, without interposing\n\nthe veto power.3He declared that the contest was between Taylor andCass—that he doubted thatVan Burenwould get even one State, except perhaps the little state ofWisconsin;4and admonished all “Liberty” or Van Buren men, by the history of Texan Annexation to cast their votes for Gen.\n\nTaylor, andnotindirectly for Gen. Cass, who has avowed his favor of the unlimited exercise of the\n\nveto power, and as a probably consequence if elected, to the unbounded extension of\n\nslavery, &c.5He scored with the most scathing language, that “consistency” of the Abolitionists, which, while they professed great horror at the proposed extension\n\nof slave territory, they aided in theelectionof Mr.Polk; for which, and its disastrous consequences, they were responsible, as they held\n\nthe balance of power.6 After listening about four hours to the gentlemen, the audience retired, highly entertained\n\nand instructed with the strong array of facts and illustrations presented.",

Mr LINCOLNexplained a curious experiment which he said had been tried in the presence of a\n\nJury: a pocket book filled with blank bills had been exposed to the action of fire,\n\nand the bills had not been burnt, which same bills afterwards burnt freely when subjected\n\nto the flame of a candle, hence a jury had concluded, and Mr L. also believed that\n\nthe notes could not have been burnt in the manner stated in the affidavit. (The affidavit\n\nstated that the notes had, together with the pocket book been carbonized,not inflamed, and that on handling them they had crumbled to pieces.) Mr DOUGHERTYopposed thebillon the ground that W. Dormady should stand by the judgment of his peers. Mr KITCHELLspoke in support of thebilland urged that as part of the burnt bills had been shewn to theBankand recognized to be their bills, they were bound to make them good.2TheBank at Louisvillehad given new notes for those of that bank which had been burnt at the same time,\n\nwithout making any difficulty about it, it was the custom and practice in all such\n\ncases and ought to have been followed by the Bank of Springfield. Mr K. was guided\n\nin his opinion of this case by the report of the learned and ableJudgebefore whom the action against the bank had been brought by W.

He spoke in Dearborn Park, and was listened to\n\nby a very large audience. The speech was one that did him eminent credit, and which\n\ncannot not fail to produce a telling effect upon the political sentiment of Chicago. The exposure\n\nof the fallaciousness of the position taken by Mr.Fillmorein hisAlbanyspeech was timely and effective; and his refutation of the charge of sectionalism,\n\nso flippantly made by the slavery-extensionists against theRepublican party, was full and able.2Every point he touched upon was elucidated by the clearness of his logic, and with\n\nhis keen blade of satire he laid bare the revolting features of policy of the pseudo-Democracy. At the close of his speech he was enthusiastically and repeatedly cheered, and\n\nhe was frequently interrupted during its delivery with hearty and prolonged applause. We hope ere long to be able to announce a speech from Mr.Lincolnin our owncity.3",

Mr.Lincoln, preceded by our Band entered the crowd and mounted the stand. On being introduced\n\nin a few appropriate words by Mr.Joseph W. Sweeney, he was greeted with a shower of applause, and immediately entered upon his speech.2 It would be needless to undertake to give even a synopsis of his remarks, because\n\nby this time, all who wish to know his views on the questions of the day, have become\n\nfamiliar with them through his many published speeches. We will however name a few\n\nof those points which bear more directly on those questions concerning which Mr. Lincoln\n\nhas been so much abused. He devoted the opening of his speech to the opinions and policy ofHenry Clayon the slavery question, showing that his views and Clay’s coincided, exactly; namely:\n\nThat in the States where it already exists, it should not be interfered with, but\n\nin laying the foundation of societies, in our new Territories, where slavery does\n\nnot exist, it should not be introduced as an element.3 Mr. Lincoln next took up that position of hisSpringfieldspeech, about which so much has been said.4As we find about the same ideas involved in his lateAlton speech, that he introduced here, we take the liberty to transfer them to our columns as\n\nbeing more satisfactory to our readers.5 “Judge Douglashas again referred to a Springfield speech in which I said “a house divided, against\n\nitself cannot stand.” ‘TheJudgehas so often made the entire quotation from that speech that I can make it from memory.\n\nI used this language: And when Judge Douglas asks me why we cannot let it remain part slave and part free\n\nas the fathers of the government made, he asks a question based upon an assumption\n\nwhich is itself a falsehood; and I t",

AlexanderAnsd7 I am about to make a request of you, in behalf of the leadingRepublicans, and also of several leadingFillmore men, of thisCounty, which I have not much hope you will comply with. It is that you will attend the\n\nRepublican County Convention to be held here, to elect delegates to theState Convention, and make us a speech.2The politics of this County are in a peculiar condition. The vote at the lastPresidential electionstood:Fillmore, 657;Buchanan6,05;Fremont, 153. At the election last fall, the Fillmore & Fremont men united and elected their\n\nTicket for County Officers by from 150 to 200 majority, which shows that but few of\n\nthe Fillmore men went over to theDemocrats. At the present time, I think some of the Fillmore men are at a loss to know which\n\nto do, followDouglas, or join and act with the Republicans. A large majority of them will doubtless go\n\nwith the latter; but a good, timely speech might have a good<Page 2>effect on the wavering.3And as you are well-known by reputation here, I think, and so do those in whose behalf\n\nI write, that a speech from you at our County Convention would do more to set things\n\nright, than anything else that could be done. And further, it is generally known\n\nby those whoread, that it is the intention of the Republican party, generally, to make you their next\n\ncandidate forUnited States' Senate, and many of the people here would like to see you. Douglas' name is in everybody's\n\nmouth, and it is time the people were beginning to talk about the opposition candidate.4It would be a spendid achievement to elect a Republican Representative^to theLegislature^from this district, (Bond &Clinton,) and with proper efforts, I believe it can be done.5 Please to let me hear from you soon. If you possibly can come, do so; and appoint\n\nyour own time, if you wish, any day about the first of June, and let us know, and\n\nwe will get up the meeting. ID",

There are no doubt serious difficulties in the matter. Such must necessarily be the\n\ncase in^an^assembly constituted as ours is this winter. But it seems to me that, you might,\n\nby some concessions, such as could be made by you without any sacrifice of principle,\n\nbring the wholefree soilelement to your support. I speak of those who have hitherto been distinctive \"Free\n\nSoilers.\"3Are you bound to stand byevery thingin theCompromise measuresof 1850? Could’nt you concede to them a modification of theFugitive Slave act? With this & such positions as you can assume in relation to the prohibition of\n\nSlavery in the Territories & the admission of additional Slave states, I cannot\n\nsee why these men cannot unite upon you to a man.4 I am satisfied that there are men,in our own ranks,waiting&longingfor you to be set aside, for the chance it may givethemof an election.5Shieldsfriends here are now seemingly animated with new hopes, either that he will be elected\n\nor that there will be no election.6Pardon me for these very hasty suggestions, & attribute them to a desire that our\n\ncause may triumph in your election.",

Hon.Abraham Lincolnhits the nail on the head every time, and in this instance it will be seen, he has\n\ndriven it entirely out of sight,— if we succeed as well as we anticipate in re-producing\n\nfrom memory his argument in relation to “Disunion.” Mr.Lincolnwas addressing himself to the opponents ofFremontand theRepublican party,2and had referred to the charge of “sectionalism,” and then spoke something as follows\n\nin relation to another charge, and said: “You further charge us with being Disunionists. If you mean that it is ouraimto dissolve the Union, for myself I answer, that is untrue; for those who act with\n\nme I answer, that it is untrue. Have you heard us assert that as our aim? Do you\n\nreally believe that such is our aim? Do you find it in our platform, our speeches,\n\nour conversation, or anywhere? If not, withdraw the charge. But, you may say, that though it is not youraim, it will be the result, if we succeed, and that we are therefore Disunionists in\n\nfact. This is a grave charge you make against us, and we certainly have a right to\n\ndemand that you specify in what way we are to dissolve the Union. How are we to effect\n\nthis? The only specification offered is volunteered by Mr.Fillmore, in hisAlbanyspeech. His charge is, that if we elect a President and Vice President both from\n\nthe Free States, it will dissolve the Union.3This is open folly. The Constitution provides, that the President and Vice President\n\nof the United States shall be of different States; but says nothing as to the latitude\n\nand longitude of those States4In1828,Andrew JacksonofTennesse, andJohn C. CalhounofSouth Carolina, were elected President and Vice President, both from slave States; but no one thought\n\nof dissolving the Union then, on that account. In1840,HarrisonofOhio, andTylerofVirginia, were elected. In 1849, Harrison died,5and John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency, andW. P. Mangum, ofN. Carolina, was elected",

On last night Hon.Abram Lincoln, a distinguished and able statesman and orator of thisState, spoke on theKansas Nebraska billto the citizens of thiplace, at North Market Hall. Although the notice that he would speak was given merely\n\nthrough the papers, the fame and reputation of the orator and the absorbing interest\n\nyet felt here on this subject, drew together a large and intelligent audience. The\n\nHall was filled, and the speaker listened to with attention and approbation.2 His speech of last evening was as thorough an exposition of theNebraskainiquity as has ever been made, and his eloquence greatly impressed all his hearers,\n\nbut it was manifest, as he frequently remarked that “he could not help feeling foolish in answering arguments which were no arguments at\n\nall.”3He could not help feeling silly in beating the air before an intelligent audience.\n\nIt is a fruitless job to pound dry sand, under the delusion that it is a rock. The\n\nlaborer may get his eyes full, but the sand is just as sandy as it was before. It is not at all important that we should give a report of his arguments of Friday\n\nevening— Our readers, those of them who are not already convnced, are not open to conviction, and it is useless to waste any strength upon them.\n\nOne or two of Mr. Lincoln’s points, however, we cannot help referring to. He said\n\nthat he had heard Mr.Douglasargue half an hour to show that there was a necessity of territorial organization\n\nin Nebraska andKansas, as though it was the main point of all his efforts, and as though somebody was actually\n\ngoing to dispute him. It was a great trick among some public speakers to hurl a naked\n\nabsurdity at his audience, with such confidence that they should be puzzled to know\n\nif the speaker didn’t see some point of great magnitude in it which entirely escaped\n\ntheir observation. A neatly varnished sophism would be readily penetrated, but a\n\ngreat, roughnon ",

That subject, and no other, was embraced\n\nin this bill. There were some others who desired, while they were legislating on this\n\nsubject, that they should also give bounty lands to the volunteers of thewar of 1812. Hisfriend from Marylandsaid there were no such men. He (Mr. L.) did not say there were many, but he was\n\nvery confident there were some. His friend from Kentucky near him (Mr.Gaines) told him he himself was one. TheSPEAKERreplied in the negative.4",

You still seem to be a little mistaken about theCongressional Globe and Appendix– They containallof the speeches that are published in any way– My ",

In commencing his speech to day, in a grove adjoining Bath, where a large and most respectable audience greeted him.\n\nMr. Lincoln said he had many things since coming intoMasen Countyto remind him that he had ceased to be a young man. Among the old men, he had met\n\nmore than half a dozen who were in the same company with him 27 years ago in theBlack Hawk war—a war which truly was not a very extensive one, or calculated to make great heroes\n\nof men engaged in it.2But here are these old men now, some of them on the stand with him; and on this\n\nvery spot, 22 years ago, he (Mr.L.) had with his own hands staked out the first plat of this town of Bath, then a wooded\n\nwildnerness.3But what more reminded him of his advancing age, was the number of young men around\n\nhim, now, and for years past, voters, who were the sons of his friends of early years,\n\nand who are now of the age he was when he first knew their fathers. Here at least\n\nhe expected to be heard with candor, and respectful attention—and he was so heard,\n\nthroughout an address of more than two hours’ duration. TheRepublicansat theirSpringfield Conventionof June 16th, said he, had chosen to put him forward as candidate for U.S. Senator—as\n\ntheir standard bearer in thecampaign. He appreciated the honor, but felt the responsibility of the task. Recurring to\n\nthe great disturbing question of the day, Slavery, he stated his belief thatDouglashad never in his life once intimated that there was any wrong in slavery; ann that if that gentleman were here, he would not, even to secure every voter present,\n\nmake this admission. And yet, he was trying to wrap himself up in the cloak ofHenry Clay, a statesman in defence of whose principles Lincoln had battled all his life. Not a shred of that cloak\n\nwould he allow to Lincoln.4But this old son ofKentucky, a ",

I have considered the ways of life, with fair attention ’till I am persuaded to the\n\nstudy of Law.

I must commence right if I would end well\n\non the journey of life. It is now time for me to commence my chief business of life— no man can know all of\n\neverything.

Why did not he speak what he ought to have\n\nspoken? That was the very thing. He should have spoken manly, and we should then have\n\nknown where to have found him.It is said we expect to elect Fremont by Northern votes.17Certainly we do not think the South will elect him. But let us ask the question differently.\n\nDoes not Buchanan expect to be elected by Southern votes? Fillmore, however, will\n\ngo out of this contest the most national man we have. He has no prospect of having\n\na single vote on either side ofMason and Dixon’s line, to trouble his poor soul about.(Laughter and cheers.) They tell us that we are in company with men who have long been known as abolitionists.\n\nWhat care we how many may feel disposed to labor for our cause? Why do not you, Buchanan\n\nmen, come in and use your influence to make our party respectable?(Laughter.)How is the dissolution of the Union to be consummated? They tell us that the Union\n\nis in danger. Who will divide it? Is it those who make the charge? Are they themselves\n\nthe persons who wish to see this result? A majority will never dissolve the Union.\n\nCan a minority do it? When this Nebraska bill was first introduced into Congress,\n\nthe sense of theDemocratic partywas outraged.19That party has ever prided itself, that it was the friend of individual, universal\n\nfreedom. It was that principle upon which they carried their measures. When theKansas schemewas conceived, it was natural that this respect and sense should have been outraged.\n\nNow I make this appeal to the Democratic citizens here. Don’t you find yourself making\n\narguments in support of these measures, which you never would have made before? Did\n\nyou ever do it before th",

You will have perceived however that it is turning on its tracks. The conduct\n\nof Douglas and his friends, in claimingBarretsvictory in their favor giveshim^it^a good opportunity though he would have attacked Douglas any way soon after the election.2 I have seen a list of your appointments.3Keep a day or two in Octob. forSt. Clair&Madison. There is Court in Octob. in Madison. A speech inHighlandwould do good. We must work hard in thatCounty.4But there is one County, which we can carry, if we try, & that isRandolph. Douglas' friends consider it asverydoubtful.5Court commences there 6 Sept. Could you not change your appointment and come down toChester.6There are boats going down fromSt Louisevery evening about 4 oclock. You will get there the same night. Now say that you will be there on 7 or 8 Sept— & you will have a large audience and can anticipate Douglas, who gets there<Page 2>immediatelyafterCourt, he having so managed down here, as to skip every Court. He speaks inMonroe, while Court is in Randolph, & in Randolph while Court is in Monroe. He spoke in\n\nHighland (without previous appointment) while Court was inCarlyle20 miles distant.– Ain't that strange.7 I think we will carry St. Clair handsomely.8Waste no ammunition unnecessarily.– TheBuchananmen here have no backbone. I think we may as well prepare to fight them in a solid\n\nphalanx. The Douglas men are as much pro slavery, as the Buchanan men, only they\n\nare acting a little more hypocritically.9If I were you I would use his accepting the victory of Barret as his thunder upon\n\nhim, and handle him without gloves. He is an arch-traitor, an consumate political scoundrel, who can only be broke down by hard-sledge-hammer licks.– I seeTrumbullhas come.10None but doubtful counties should be canvassedOur strength must be concentrated on a few points.",

Henrylast week, as well as those of the Committee appointed by that meeting, will be found\n\nbelow. The character of the Committee of Investigation is a sure guarantee for the\n\nfairness and justice of the Report. The public have now all the facts before them\n\nupon which they can form an opinion. That those facts fully bear out the committee\n\nin saying, that the Commissioners are “entitled to the thanks and gratitude of their\n\nfellow citizens,” we believe there should not be a dissenting voice.1 The committee who made this Report are among our best citizens; and fairness requires\n\nus to say that a majority of them are opposed, politically, to Dr. Henry. At a meeting of Citizens of Sangamon County, held at the Court Room inSpringfield, on the 24th of June, 1837,JOHN T. STUART, Esq. was called to the Chair, and Col.ROBERT ALLENwas appointed Secretary. The object of the meeting having been stated,A. Lincoln, Esq. offered the following Preamble and Resolutions: “Whereas we have seen several publications in the “Illinois Republican,” stating that Dr. A. G. Henry, one of the Commissioners appointed by the Legislature\n\nto superintend the building of the State House, is squandering disadvantageously and\n\nuselessly the public money appropriated by the citizens of this place for that object;\n\nand, whereas, if the charge be true, it is highly important to the interest of the\n\nState, that the trust now held by Dr. Henry should be immediately placed in other\n\nhands: therefore Resolved, That a Committee of seven be appointed to examine the books and proceedings\n\nof the Commissioners appointed to superintend the building of the State House, and\n\nthat said Committee make a full and complete Report of said proceedings, together\n\nwith such remarks upon the facts disclosed as their acquaintance with such business\n\nmay enable them ",

At the close of his remarks he spoke\n\nof theKnow Nothingorganization; their designs, and their tendency towhigery, which could not fail to have convinced his hearers of thepartycharacter of this secret organization. Mr.Lincolnreplied to Mr.C., and, with his usual ability, made the best of a bad position. We have never heard\n\nhim when more at fault in covering up the heresies which he habitually takes to.\n\nThe whole tenor of his discussion was to satisfy thewhigportion of his audience that affiliation withabolitionismwas the only salvation of their party, and (Heaven save the mark!) of the country!\n\nHe knew nothing of the secret institution of which Mr. Calhoun spoke, and, like theJournal, even “doubted its existence.4Of course he did. He “Knows Nothing” about it. The result of the debate, we are satisfied, was to convince the audience of the fallacy\n\nof the present abolition outcry, and the correctness of the policy of leaving to the\n\npeople of the territories the adjustment of their own domestic affairs; a privilege\n\nwhich we, asIllinoisans, claim for ourselves, and which we cannot, in justice, deny to others of our fellow\n\ncountrymen.5",
