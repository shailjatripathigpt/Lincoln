Abraham Lincoln LLM Project - Final Report
===========================================
Project: Abraham Lincoln LLM Enhancement
Start Time: 2025-12-31T11:12:25.528375
End Time: 2026-01-05T23:32:04.842542
Total Duration: 476379.3 seconds (7939.7 minutes)
Steps Completed: 7/7 (100.0%)

FINAL DECISION: Prompt Engineering with Context

KEY METRICS:
- RAG Relevance Score: 0.559
- Total Words Analyzed: 0
- QLoRA Fine-Tuning Feasible: False

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ! RAG system performs moderately (relevance 0.5-0.7)
     -> Could be improved with better embeddings or document chunking
  ✗ Insufficient data for fine-tuning
     -> Focus on prompt engineering and RAG
  
[TARGET] RECOMMENDED: Use prompt engineering with document context extraction
