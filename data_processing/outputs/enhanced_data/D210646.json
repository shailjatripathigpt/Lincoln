        "text": "3Lincoln, James Shields,Lyman Trumbull, andJoel A. Mattesonwere the main contenders in the election for Illinois’ next U.S. Senator.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. He won a seat\n                  in theIllinois House of Representatives, but in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. When the General Assembly met in a\n                  joint session on February 8, 1855, to elect a U.S. senator, Lincoln and Shields received\n                  the most votes in the first round of balloting, with forty-five and forty-one votes\n                  respectively. As neither received a majority of votes, several more rounds of balloting\n                  ensued. Lincoln received a majority of the anti-Nebraska votes until the tenth and\n                  final ballot, when he withdrew and urged his supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska\n                  Democrat Trumbull in order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat.\n                  With the votes of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See1854 Federal Election.Lincoln had received several letters in December 1854 that also mentioned the possibility\n                  that Democrats in the Illinois General Assembly would refuse to hold an election for\n                  U.S. Senator if they could not elect apro-Nebraskapolitician. In fact, it was the anti-Nebraska forces that attempted to delay the\n                  election when Shields pulled even with Lincoln after the third ballot.Stephen T. Loganmotioned for the adjournment of the joint session, but members refused to adjourn\n                  by a vote of fifty-six to forty-two. Of the forty-one legislators who voted for Lincoln\n                  on the third ballot,WhigrepresentativeGeorge F. Fostercast the single vote against adjourning the session.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

Watsonvisited Lincoln inSpringfieldin June 1855 in regards to the defense of the case ofMcCormick v. Talcott et al.Cyrus H. McCormickhad instituted a suit against theRockfordfirm ofManny & Companyin theU.S. Circuit Courtin November 1854 for patent infringement. Wait Talcott was a member of the firm.\n                  McCormick claimed that the mechanical reaper ofJohn H. Manny’s design and manufacture copied several elements of McCormick’s own reaper. Manny\n                  & Co. was represented in the case by Watson, who had helped John H. Manny obtain his\n                  patents, as well as attorneysGeorge HardingandEdwin M. Stanton. Upon meeting with Lincoln, Watson hired him for the defense with a $400 retainer,\n                  as none of Manny’s legal representatives lived in Illinois and they apparently deemed\n                  it prudent to include an attorney from the state as the trial was to be held inChicago. The trial was instead moved toCincinnati, where it commenced on September 20, 1855, and while the other members of the defense\n                  team allowed Lincoln to attend, they blocked his participation in the case. McCormick’s\n                  attorneys in the case includedIsaac N. ArnoldandEdward N. Dickerson. The verdict in the case was announced on January 16, 1856 in favor of Manny & Co.,\n                  after which McCormick appealed the decision to theU.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court’s ruling.McCormick v.

Ray wrote that he had resolved that Lincoln\n                  was the best candidate for Illinois’ next U.S. Senator, and that he would work to\n                  sway his friends among the anti-Nebraska Democrats. Ray  also stated that he was a\n                  candidate for a clerkship in the U.S. House of Representatives for the next session\n                  of Congress and requested Washburne’s support in obtaining the position. He further\n                  requested Washburne to ask Lincoln to intercede on his behalf with members of the\n                  Illinois General Assembly to assist him in securing a proposed position as superintendent\n                  of the 1855 Illinois state census. No evidence has been found of Ray receiving a clerkship\n                  in the U.S. House of Representatives at this time. On February 12, 1855 the Illinois\n                  House of Representatives passed a bill to provide for taking the 1855 census, which\n                  included a provision to employ Ray as census superintendent at a salary of $1,200.\n                  Before the bill was signed into law by the governor, it was amended by theIllinois Senate, and the act as passed contained no mention of Ray or any other superintendent for\n                  the census. In the summer of 1855 Ray took over editorship of theChicago Tribune.Charles H. Ray to Elihu B. Washburne, 12 January 1855,E. B.

Washburne and others believed that Lincoln needed the support of Lovejoy and his\n                  fellowFree Soilersin the General Assembly to win the senatorial election, but they were concerned because\n                  Lovejoy held more radical views on theabolitionof slavery than Lincoln.Jesse O. Nortonand Washburne urged Lincoln to change his position on theCompromise of 1850and theFugitive Slave Lawto improve his prospects among the Free Soilers. In aletterto Lincoln dated December 26, 1854, Washburne assured Lincoln that Joshua R. Giddings\n                  was writing Lovejoy with his views on Lincoln’s candidacy, to be shared with Free\n                  Soilers in the General Assembly. When he learned that Lovejoy had not received Giddings’\n                  letter, WashburneassuredLincoln that Giddings had telegraphed Lovejoy about the letter’s disposition. Lovejoy\n                  apparently never received Giddings’ first letter, prompting Gidding to write Lovejoy\n                  a second time.In alistof members of the Illinois General Assembly that Lincoln created around January 1855,\n                  Lincoln listed Lovejoy as an abolitionist--the only legislator he so designated. Lovejoy\n                  voted for Lincoln on the first three ballots, then switched toWilliam B. Ogdenfor four ballots, before settling on Trumbull on the eighth ballot.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac, 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 221;Elihu B.
