Douglas andDemocraticnewspapers claimed that  Stuart pledged, in a speech on July 3, to replace theIndependent Sub-Treasury Systemwith a bank without a charter or stockholders, owned solely by the federal and state\n                  governments.Whigpapers denied this charge, arguing that Stuart had suggested one plan for a national\n                  bank similar to that introduced byHenry Clayin theSenate, but had endorsed no specific proposal.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 14 July 1838, 2:1; Robert W.

        "text": "5Relations between Douglas and Stuart were cordial at the beginning of the campaign,\n                  the candidates traveling together across the district, debating the issues by day\n                  and sharing accommodations in the evening.  As the race drew closer, relations between\n                  the two soured and the speeches became more personal, culminating late in the campaign\n                  in an impromptu scuffle between the two as they debated the issues inSpringfield.When the ballots were finally tallied, Stuart defeated Douglas by a scant 36 votes\n                  (18,254 for Stuart to 18,218 for Douglas).  McLean County went for Stuart, 721 to\n                  536.  The closeness of the vote and accusations of voter irregularities prompted Douglas\n                  to contest the election, to no avail.Erika  Holst, “Political Mudslinging in Springfield,”Illinois Times, 6 November 2014,http://illinoistimes.com/article-14659-political-mudslinging-in-springfield.html; Robert W.
