        "text": "2In April 1832, Lincoln volunteered for service in the Black Hawk War. The volunteers\n                  in his company elected him company captain.  The Fourth Illinois Regiment of Mounted\n                  Volunteers was part of the brigade commanded by Brigadier GeneralSamuel Whiteside. David H. Rutledge served under Lincoln as a private in this unit from April 21,\n                  1832 to May 27, 1832.Lincoln provided this affidavit testifying to Rutledge’s service to aid Rutledge’s\n                  widow, Elizabeth Rutledge, in her effort to secure possession of the land warrants\n                  due to Rutledge for his service in the war. On September 28, 1850, theU.S. Congresshad passed an act granting certain groups who had served in the United States military\n                  during theWar of 1812, any of “the Indian wars” since 1790, and theMexican Warparcels of public land. Per this act, the amount of land that they were entitled\n                  to depended upon the length of engagement and actual time served. Lincoln’s affidavit\n                  attesting to Rutledge’s dates of service was, therefore, critical to Elizabeth Rutledge’s\n                  claim, which she made to theU.S. Bureau of Pensionsin September 1851. The Bureau may also have had access to Rutledge’scertificate of servicefrom the war, which Lincoln had personally signed in 1832.The outcome of Elizabeth Rutledge’s claim is unknown; however, per the aforementioned\n                  act, as the  widow of a private who served at least one full month in one of the Indian\n                  wars, she most likely received a certificate or land warrant from theU.S. Department of the Interiorfor forty acres of public land.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:67; Isaac H. Elliott,Record of the Services of Illinois Soldiers in the Black Hawk War, 1831-32, and in\n                        the Mexican War, 1846-8(Springfield, IL: H. W.
