        "text": "7Apportionment of seats in the Illinois General Assembly cost Lincoln the election.\n                  The voting districts in Illinois were created using the 1850 census and the northern,\n                  Republican voting districts increased much quicker in population than the southern,\n                  Democratic voting districts in the eight years between the census and the election\n                  of 1858. Republicans received 50 percent of the popular vote and 46 percent of the\n                  Illinois General Assembly while Democrats won 48 percent of the popular vote and 54\n                  percent of the Illinois General Assembly. According to theSangamo Journal, “The thirty five Lincoln members of theHouserepresent a larger population than the forty Douglas members; and the eleven Lincoln\n                  Senators represent a larger constitnency than the fourteen Douglas and Buchanan senators.\n                  ...In the Republican districts it requires on an average a population of 19,635 inhabitants\n                  to elect a representative, and 58,900 for a Senator, while in the Democratic districts\n                  15,675 for a representative and 47,100 for a Senator suffices. On a fair apportionment,\n                  Douglas would have been beaten seven in the House and three in theSenate.” Republicans in the state were frustrated with the loss in the election and fearful\n                  of losing future elections for the same reason.In the state elections of 1860, Republicans won control of both the Illinois House\n                  and Senate, gaining a one seat majority in the Senate and five seat majority in the\n                  House, allowing Lyman Trumbull to win reelection to the U.S. Senate.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:546-47;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 9 November, 1858, 2:1;Illinois Daily State Journal(Springfield), 11 December 1860, 2:3;Ottawa Free Trade(IL), 15 December 1860, 1:6; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
