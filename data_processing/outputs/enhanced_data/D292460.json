Within this context, Wilson\n                  is referring to the Democratic Party.Lincoln delivered more than fifty speeches throughout Illinois during the campaign\n                  of 1856, including in southern Illinois--a region popularly known as “Egypt” or “Little\n                  Egypt”. Turnout was low in southern Illinois, however, as relatively few Republicans\n                  lived in the region.D. R. Hundley,Social Relations in Our Southern States(New York: Henry B.
