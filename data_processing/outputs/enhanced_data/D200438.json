    "full_text": "Report of Legislative Proceeding regarding Postal Contracts, 5 January 18481 Mr. LINCOLNsaid that he had made an effort some few days since to obtain the floor in relation\n\nto this measure, but had failed.2One of the objects he had then had in view was now in a great measure superseded\n\nby what had fallen from thegentlemanfromVirginiawho had just taken his seat.3He begged to assure his friends on the other side of theHouse, that no assault whatever was meant upon thePostmaster General; and he was glad that what the gentleman had now said, modified to a great extent\n\nthe impression which might have been created by the language he had used on a previous\n\noccasion. He wanted to state to gentlemen who might have entertained such impressions,\n\nthat the Committee on the Post Office was composed of fiveWhigsand fourDemocrats, and their report was understood as sustaining, not im-<Page 2>pugning, the position taken by the Postmaster General.4That report had met with the approbation of all the Whigs and of all the Democrats\n\nalso, with the exception of one, and he wanted to go even further than this. (Intimations\n\nwere here informally given to Mr. L. that it was not in order to mention on the floor\n\nwhat had taken place in committee.) He then observed that if he had been out of order\n\nin what he had said, he took it all back, (a laugh,) so far as he could. He had no\n\ndesire, he could assure gentlemen, ever to be out of order—though he never could keep\n\nlonginorder. Mr. L. went on to observe, that he differed in opinion, in the present case, from\n\nhis honorable friend fromRichmond, (Mr.Botts.) That gentleman had begun his remarks by saying that if all prepossessions in this\n\nmatter could be removad out of the way, but little difficulty would be experienced in coming to an agreement.\n\nNow, he could assure that gentleman that he had himself begun the examination of this\n\nsubject with prepossessions all in his favor. He had long and often heard of him,\n\nand, from what he had heard, was prepossessed in his favor. Of the Postmaster General\n\nhe had also heard, but had no prepossessions in his favor, though certainly none of\n\nan opposite kind. He differed, however, from that gentleman in politics, while in\n\nthis respect he agreed with the gentleman from Virginia, (Mr.Botts,) whom he wished to oblige whenever it was in his power. That gentleman had referred\n\nto the report made to the House by the Postmaster General, and had intimated an apprehension\n\nthat gentlemen would be disposed to rely on that report alone, and derive their views\n\nof the case from that document alone. Now, it so happened that a pamphlet had been\n\nslipped into his (Mr. L.’s) hand before he read the report of the Postmaster General;\n\nso that, even in this, he had begun with prepossessions in favor of the gentleman\n\nfrom Virginia.5 As to the report, he had but one remark to make: he had carefully examined it, and\n\nhe did not understand that there was any dispute as to the facts therein stated: the\n\ndispute, if he understood it, was confined altogether to the inferences to be drawn\n\nfrom those facts. It was a difference not about facts, but about conclusions. The\n\nfacts were not disputed. If he was right in this, he supposed the House might assume\n\nthe facts to be as they were stated, and thence proceed to draw their own conclusions. The gentleman had said that the Postmaster General had got into a personal squabble\n\nwith the railroad company. Of this, Mr. L. knew nothing; nor did he need or desire\n\nto know anything, because it had nothing whatever to do with a just conclusion from\n\nthe premises. But the gentleman had gone on to ask whether so great a grievance as\n\nthe present detention of the southern mail ought not to be remedied? Mr. L. would\n\nassure the gentleman that if there was a proper way of doing it, no man was more anxious\n\nthat he that it should be done. The report made by the committee had been intended\n\nto yield much for the sake of removing that grievance. That the grievance was very\n\ngreat, there was no dispute in any quarter. He supposed the statements made by the\n\ngentleman from Virginia to show this were all entirely correct in point of fact. He\n\ndid suppose that the interruptions of regular intercourse, and all the other inconveniences\n\ngrowing out of it, were all as that gentleman had stated them to be; and certainly,\n\nif redress could be rendered, it was proper it should be rendered as soon as possible.\n\nThe gentleman said that, in order to effect this, no new legislative action was needed:\n\nall that was necessary was, that the Postmaster General should be required to do what\n\nthe law, as it stood, authorized and required him to do. We come, then, said Mr. L., to the law. Now the Postmaster General says that he cannot\n\ngive to this company over $23750 per railroad mile of transportation, and 12½ per cent. less for transportation by steamboats. He considers himself as restricted by law\n\nto this amount; and he says, further, that he would not give more if he could, because,\n\nin his apprehension, it would not be fair and just. Mr. HILLIARDhere wished to be set right in his apprehension of the facts of the case, and he\n\nmade some inquiry not distinctly heard across the Hall; and, after a brief conversation,\n\nexpressing himself satisfied, resumed his seat. Mr. LINCOLN proceeded. I had the impression that the service rendered under the present\n\ncontract cost the Government more than if the mail were carried by the railroad company,\n\nin consequence of its passing over a longer route. Understanding this, my view of\n\nthe question remains unchanged. And now as to the law: I am not disposed to discuss it at any very great length; for,\n\nas the appeal is here to the law-making power, which can alter the law whenever a\n\nmodification is required, there does not seem any necessity of very nicely discussing\n\nwhat it is as it now stands. If it shall be clearly shown what naked justice requires,\n\nit will be easy to make the law conform to that requirement. But let us look at it\n\nas it stands. There are three laws which have a bearing on this question: the first authorizes the\n\nPostmaster General to give to a contractor 25 per cent. more for the transportation of the mail over railroads than for similar transportation\n\nin mail-coaches; another law says that the Postmaster General shall not allow more\n\nthan $300 per mile for daily transportation, provided that his contract does not conflict\n\nwith the provisions of the law first referred to. Then there is a third law which\n\ndirects the Postmaster General to classify the sorts of service rendered6It was this which caused him to give less for transportation by steamboats than over\n\nrailroads; he graduated the compensation for this at a point midway between that by\n\nrailroad and that by mail-coaches. The difference between railroad and coach being\n\nbut 25 per cent., he placed the price for steamboat transportation at 12½ per cent. above the one and below the other. I do not understand that this construction of\n\nthe law by the Postmaster General is held in any quarter to be wrong. The fact that\n\nthe law allows him to pay $300 for daily transportation and for more frequent than\n\ndaily, has been alluded to; but, as I understand, the position is not taken that he\n\nis authorized to allow this company $300 per mile. If it is, I shall proceed to examine\n\nit. All must admit that all the laws on the subject are extremely loose and general\n\nin their language; that they admit of different constructions; and that no one construction\n\nthat can be given them leaves the mind entirely satisfied. The law allows $300 to\n\nbe paid for transporting the mail daily or oftener, thereby fixing the compensation\n\nfor one transportation and for two at the same amount. This alone is enough to show\n\nthat the law is not very definite in its provisions, and in fact it is hardly possible\n\nto put an equitable construction upon it. It refers to a prior law, and says it is\n\nnot to be construed so as to interfere with it. From the whole of what the gentleman from Virginia has said, I understand his sense\n\nof the matter to be, that we are in this case to be governed by the old law. Now,\n\nI ask the lawyers in this House (I suppose there are some) (a laugh) whether I am\n\nnot right when I say, that where a law has been passed in terms so general as to require\n\na construction to be put upon it, (and this is the case with most laws,) and constructions\n\nof its provisions are accordingly given, and a second law is afterwards passed referring\n\nto the first, this second law is held to recognize and to confirm the constructions\n\nput upon that first passed? If this is so, then I say that the Postmaster General\n\nwas not wrong when he insisted that the latter law, when it referred to the former,\n\nmeant to refer to it as construed; in which case the construction seems to be confirmed\n\nand strengthened by the last passed. But, looking only to the original construction itself of the old law, the gentleman\n\nfrom Virginia says that Mr.Kendall’s construction of the terms “similar transportation by mail coaches,” was wrong,\n\nand that he ought to have construed it to mean transportation of the same mail not\n\nonly, but by the same route. But, now, suppose there was no mail-coach transportation\n\non that route, what must his construction be in that case? What did the present Postmaster\n\nGeneral in fact do? He took the most expensive mail-coach route in the nation. He\n\ntook the prices allowed for coach transportation on different portions of that route,\n\nand averaged them, and then built his construction of the law upon that average. It\n\ncame to $190 per mile. He added 25 per cent. to that rate, and offered the result to this railroad company. The gentleman from\n\nVirginia says that this was wrong: I say it was right. But the gentleman says he ought to have reckoned coach transportation on that specific\n\nroute. Well, if he had done so, he would have added 25 per cent. upon $5,000, and no more; for the Postmaster General tells us that before he made\n\nhis contract with this railroad company, the same mail had been carried for between\n\n$5,000 and $6,000. The company now get $28,000, and are not satisfied. Had he taken\n\nthe same rate then, where would they have been? If there had been a coach line, he\n\nwould not have gained anything by that. For I have inquired at what rate the mail\n\ncould be carried by coaches from Washington to Richmond, and I have heard that the\n\nlowest bid ever made was $28,000. If he had added 25 per cent. to that, it would have been more than the company asks. This fact, and one other\n\nitem that I obtained, are all that I had to enable me to get at justice in this case.\n\nAn old gentleman, whose very good looks prepossessed me in his favor, and would incline\n\nme to believe any statement he should make, told me that he had been a stockholder\n\nin the road, and had never got over 5 per cent. dividend on his stock. The same source of information admitted that since the construction\n\nof the railroad, mail-coaches had been wholly disused. It is a bad road, and always\n\nhas been, and the mail could not now be carried over it in coaches for three or four\n\ntimes what it might have been, had not the railroad been constructed. I think that abundant reasons have been given to show that the construction put upon\n\nthe law by the Postmaster General is the right construction, and that subsequent acts\n\nofCongresshave confirmed it. I have already said that the grievance complained of ought to\n\nbe remedied. But it is said that the sum of money about which all this difficulty\n\nhas arisen is exceeding small—not more than $2,700. I admit it is very small; and\n\nif nothing else were involved, it would not be worth the dispute. But there is a principle\n\ninvolved; and if we once yield to a wrong principle, that concession will be the prolific\n\nsource of endless mischief. It is for this reason, and not for the sake of saving\n\n$2,700, that I am unwilling to yield what is demanded. If I had no apprehensions that\n\nthe ghost of this yielding would rise and appear in various distant places, I would\n\nsay, pay the money, and let us have no more fuss about it. But I have such apprehensions.\n\nI do believe, that if we yield this, our act will be the source of other claims equally\n\nunjust, and therefore I cannot vote to make the allowance. And now, I suppose, I may, without being out of order, tell what I was willing, in\n\ncommittee, to yield for the sake of removing this evil. I was willing to give as damages\n\nwhat the department would have to pay the Bay Company for breach of contract, be it\n\n$2,700, or whatever amount. Be it what it might, it would be so much money gone; it\n\nwould never rise again. Mr. L. insisted that the true and great point to which the attention of this House\n\nor the committee should be directed was, what is a just compensation? Inasmuch as\n\nthis railroad and steamboat company could afford greater facilities than any other\n\nline, the service ought to be done upon this route; but it ought to be done upon just\n\nand fair principles. If it could not be done at what had been offered, let it be shown\n\nthat a greater amount was just. But, until it was shown, he was opposed to increasing\n\nit. He had seen many things in the report of the Postmaster General and elsewhere\n\nthat stood out against the river route. Now, the daily steamboat transportation betweenTroyandNew Yorkwas performed for less than one hundred dollars per mile. This company was dissatisfied\n\nwith two hundred and twelve or two hundred and thirteen dollars per mile. It had not\n\nbeen shown, and he thought it could not be shown to them why this company was entitled\n\nto more, or so much more, than the other received. It was true, they had to encounter\n\nthe ice, but was there not more ice further north? There might possibly be shown some\n\nreason why the Virginia line should have more; but was there any reason why they should\n\nhave so much more? Again, the price paid betweenCincinnatiandLouisvillefor daily transportation was not two hundred and thirteen dollars per mile, or one\n\nhundred dollars, or fifty; it was less than twenty-eight dollars per mile. Now, he\n\ndid not insist that there might not be some peculiar reasons connected with this route\n\nbetween this city and Richmond that entitled it to<Page 3>more than was paid on the routes between Cincinnati and Louisville, and Troy and New\n\nYork. But, if there were reasons, they ought to be shown. And was it supposed that\n\nthere could be any, or so peculiar reasons, as to justify so great a difference in\n\ncompensation as was claimed by this company? It did seem that there could be none. These reasons actuated him in taking the position he had taken, painfully refusing\n\nto oblige his friend from Virginia, which he assured the gentleman he had the greatest\n\ninclination to do. In relation to the report of the committee, let him state one thing: It proposed\n\nthat the Postmaster General should again offer this company what he had already offered\n\nand they had refused. It was for the reason that the Postmaster General, as he understood,\n\nhad informed them that he was not himself going to renew the proposition. The committee\n\nsupposed—at any rate, he (Mr. L.) supposed—that as soon as the company should know\n\nthat they could get what he had offered them, and no more—as soon as all hope of greater\n\ncompensation was cut off—that instant they would not take ten thousand dollars a year\n\nfor the privilege of doing it. Whether this was actually the case he did not profess\n\npositively to know; it was a matter of opinion, but he firmly believed it. In proposing\n\nto offer them the contract again, as he had already said, the committee yielded something,\n\nviz: the damage that the Government would have to pay for the breaking up of the present\n\narrangement. He was willing to incur that damage; some other gentlemen were not; they\n\nwere further away from the position which his friend from Virginia took. He was willing\n\nto yield something, but could not consent to go the whole length with the gentleman. In relation to what the damage would be, it would of course depend upon what was shown\n\nto this House and to theSenateto be fair and reasonable. It was a general principle of law that this Government\n\ncould not be sued upon any contract. It was a principle of the common law that no\n\njudgment can go against the State, and it had been confirmed by theSupreme Court of the United Statesin repeated instances. Now, how was this company to get anything for their damages?\n\nWhy, simply by coming here and laying their case before Congress. Mr. L. concluded by remarking that this was all he wished to say. If there was any\n\nportion of his hour left, he would only ask that it should be passed to his credit\n\nfor some future occasion.7",

      "the law by the Postmaster General is the right construction, and that subsequent acts",
      "ofCongresshave confirmed it. I have already said that the grievance complained of ought to",
      "be remedied. But it is said that the sum of money about which all this difficulty",
      "has arisen is exceeding small—not more than $2,700. I admit it is very small; and",
      "if nothing else were involved, it would not be worth the dispute. But there is a principle",
      "involved; and if we once yield to a wrong principle, that concession will be the prolific",
      "source of endless mischief. It is for this reason, and not for the sake of saving",
      "$2,700, that I am unwilling to yield what is demanded. If I had no apprehensions that",
      "the ghost of this yielding would rise and appear in various distant places, I would",
      "say, pay the money, and let us have no more fuss about it. But I have such apprehensions.",
      "I do believe, that if we yield this, our act will be the source of other claims equally",
      "unjust, and therefore I cannot vote to make the allowance. And now, I suppose, I may, without being out of order, tell what I was willing, in",
      "committee, to yield for the sake of removing this evil. I was willing to give as damages",
      "what the department would have to pay the Bay Company for breach of contract, be it",
      "$2,700, or whatever amount. Be it what it might, it would be so much money gone; it",
      "would never rise again. Mr. L. insisted that the true and great point to which the attention of this House",
      "or the committee should be directed was, what is a just compensation? Inasmuch as",
      "this railroad and steamboat company could afford greater facilities than any other",
      "line, the service ought to be done upon this route; but it ought to be done upon just",
      "and fair principles. If it could not be done at what had been offered, let it be shown",
      "that a greater amount was just. But, until it was shown, he was opposed to increasing",
      "it. He had seen many things in the report of the Postmaster General and elsewhere",
      "that stood out against the river route. Now, the daily steamboat transportation betweenTroyandNew Yorkwas performed for less than one hundred dollars per mile. This company was dissatisfied",
      "with two hundred and twelve or two hundred and thirteen dollars per mile. It had not",
      "been shown, and he thought it could not be shown to them why this company was entitled",
      "to more, or so much more, than the other received. It was true, they had to encounter",
      "the ice, but was there not more ice further north? There might possibly be shown some",
      "reason why the Virginia line should have more; but was there any reason why they should",
      "have so much more? Again, the price paid betweenCincinnatiandLouisvillefor daily transportation was not two hundred and thirteen dollars per mile, or one",
      "hundred dollars, or fifty; it was less than twenty-eight dollars per mile. Now, he",
      "did not insist that there might not be some peculiar reasons connected with this route",
      "between this city and Richmond that entitled it to<Page 3>more than was paid on the routes between Cincinnati and Louisville, and Troy and New",
      "York. But, if there were reasons, they ought to be shown. And was it supposed that",
      "there could be any, or so peculiar reasons, as to justify so great a difference in",
      "compensation as was claimed by this company? It did seem that there could be none. These reasons actuated him in taking the position he had taken, painfully refusing",
      "to oblige his friend from Virginia, which he assured the gentleman he had the greatest",
      "inclination to do. In relation to the report of the committee, let him state one thing: It proposed",
      "that the Postmaster General should again offer this company what he had already offered",
      "and they had refused. It was for the reason that the Postmaster General, as he understood,",
      "had informed them that he was not himself going to renew the proposition. The committee",
      "supposed—at any rate, he (Mr. L.) supposed—that as soon as the company should know",
      "that they could get what he had offered them, and no more—as soon as all hope of greater",
      "compensation was cut off—that instant they would not take ten thousand dollars a year",
      "for the privilege of doing it. Whether this was actually the case he did not profess",
      "positively to know; it was a matter of opinion, but he firmly believed it. In proposing",
      "to offer them the contract again, as he had already said, the committee yielded something,",
      "viz: the damage that the Government would have to pay for the breaking up of the present",
      "arrangement. He was willing to incur that damage; some other gentlemen were not; they",
      "were further away from the position which his friend from Virginia took. He was willing",
      "to yield something, but could not consent to go the whole length with the gentleman. In relation to what the damage would be, it would of course depend upon what was shown",
      "to this House and to theSenateto be fair and reasonable. It was a general principle of law that this Government",
      "could not be sued upon any contract. It was a principle of the common law that no",
      "judgment can go against the State, and it had been confirmed by theSupreme Court of the United Statesin repeated instances. Now, how was this company to get anything for their damages?",
      "Why, simply by coming here and laying their case before Congress. Mr. L. concluded by remarking that this was all he wished to say. If there was any",
      "portion of his hour left, he would only ask that it should be passed to his credit"

All must admit that all the laws on the subject are extremely loose and general\n               in their language; that they admit of different constructions; and that no one construction\n               that can be given them  leaves the mind entirely satisfied. The law allows $300 to\n               be paid for transporting the mail daily or oftener, thereby fixing the compensation\n               for one transportation and for two at the same amount. This alone is enough to show\n               that the law is not very definite in its provisions, and in fact it is hardly possible\n               to put an equitable construction upon it. It refers to a prior law, and says it is\n               not to be construed so as to interfere with it."

Now,\n               I ask the lawyers in this House (I suppose there are some) (a laugh) whether I am\n               not right when I say, that where a law has been passed in terms so general as to require\n               a construction to be put upon it, (and this is the case with most laws,) and constructions\n               of its provisions are accordingly given, and a second law is afterwards passed referring\n               to the first, this second law is held to recognize and to confirm the constructions\n               put upon that first passed? If this is so, then I say that the Postmaster General\n               was not wrong when he insisted that the latter law, when it referred to the former,\n               meant to refer to it as construed; in which case the construction seems to be confirmed\n               and strengthened by the last passed."

But, now, suppose there was no mail-coach transportation\n               on that route, what must his construction be in that case? What did the present Postmaster\n               General in fact do? He took the most expensive mail-coach route in the nation. He\n               took the prices allowed for coach transportation on different portions of that route,\n               and averaged them, and then built his construction of the law upon that average. It\n               came to $190 per mile. He added 25 per cent. to that rate, and offered the result to this railroad company. The gentleman from\n               Virginia says that this was wrong: I say it was right."

Well, if he had done so, he would have added 25 per cent. upon $5,000, and no more; for the Postmaster General tells us that before he made\n               his contract with this railroad company, the same mail had been carried for between\n               $5,000 and $6,000. The company now get $28,000, and are not satisfied. Had he taken\n               the same rate then, where would they have been? If there had been a coach line, he\n               would not have gained anything by that. For I have inquired at what rate the mail\n               could be carried by coaches from Washington to Richmond, and I have heard that the\n               lowest bid ever made was $28,000. If he had added 25 per cent. to that, it would have been more than the company asks. This fact, and one other\n               item that I obtained, are all that I had to enable me to get at justice in this case.\n               An old gentleman, whose very good looks prepossessed me in his favor, and would incline\n               me to believe any statement he should make, told me that he had been a stockholder\n               in the road, and had never got over 5 per cent. dividend on his stock. The same source of information admitted that since the construction\n               of the railroad, mail-coaches had been wholly disused. It is a bad road, and always\n               has been, and the mail could not now be carried over it in coaches for three or four\n               times what it might have been, had not the railroad been constructed."

Inasmuch as\n               this railroad and steamboat company could afford greater facilities than any other\n               line, the service ought to be done upon this route; but it ought to be done upon just\n               and fair principles. If it could not be done at what had been offered, let it be shown\n               that a greater amount was just. But, until it was shown, he was opposed to increasing\n               it. He had seen many things in the report of the Postmaster General and elsewhere\n               that stood out against the river route. Now, the daily steamboat transportation betweenTroyandNew Yorkwas performed for less than one hundred dollars per mile. This company was dissatisfied\n               with two hundred and twelve or two hundred and thirteen dollars per mile. It had not\n               been shown, and he thought it could not be shown to them why this company was entitled\n               to more, or so much more, than the other received. It was true, they had to encounter\n               the ice, but was there not more ice further north? There might possibly be shown some\n               reason why the Virginia line should have more; but was there any reason why they should\n               have so much more? Again, the price paid betweenCincinnatiandLouisvillefor daily transportation was not two hundred and thirteen dollars per mile, or one\n               hundred dollars, or fifty; it was less than twenty-eight dollars per mile. Now, he\n               did not insist that there might not be some peculiar reasons connected with this route\n               between this city and Richmond that entitled it to<Page 3>more than was paid on the routes between Cincinnati and Louisville, and Troy and New\n               York.

It was for the reason that the Postmaster General, as he understood,\n               had informed them that he was not himself going to renew the proposition. The committee\n               supposed—at any rate, he (Mr. L.) supposed—that as soon as the company should know\n               that they could get what he had offered them, and no more—as soon as all hope of greater\n               compensation was cut off—that instant they would not take ten thousand dollars a year\n               for the privilege of doing it.
