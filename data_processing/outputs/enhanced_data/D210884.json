In his initial reaction to Lincoln, he wrote, “A native ofKentucky, where he belonged to the class of ‘poor whites,’ he came early toIllinois. Poor, unfriended, uneducated, a day-laborer, he has distanced all these disadvantages,\n                  and in the profession of the law has risen steadily to a competence and the position\n                  of an intelligent, shrewd, and well-balanced man.”Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate from Illinois for theU.S. Senate. He ran against, and lost to, DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Gilbert H.
