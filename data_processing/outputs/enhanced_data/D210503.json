Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere among the early contestants to replaceRichard M. Young, the incumbent. Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was\n                  favored over Morrison and Edwards.  On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;Josiah M.

Lincoln\n                  received several letters endorsing Remann, and on May 29, Remann himselfwroteLincoln requesting his recommendation.James Kennaday was seeking to hurt Stapp’s candidacy by charging that Stapp was not\n                  a Whig.  On April 23, 1849, Stapp wrote Lincoln refuting Kennaday’s claims.  Kennaday himselfwroteLincoln on May 2, to state his case against Stapp.  In aletterto Lincoln dated June 11, Stapp further vindicated himself, emphasizing the almost\n                  unanimous support of Whigs inFayette Countyand other counties in his congressional district.Alexander P.
