        "text": "2Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Abraham Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored\n                  over Morrison and Edwards. In early June 1849, Lincoln sent a series of letters to\n                  numerous people requesting letters in support of his candidacy. Although no such letter\n                  from Lincoln to Dubois has been located, it is likely Lincoln made a similar request\n                  of him since Dubois states that he has written President Zachary Taylor and is working\n                  to procure signatures on another letter of support.Thomas Ewingwas the secretary of theU.S. Department of the Interior, but Taylor was ultimately responsible for appointing the commissioner of the U.S.\n                  General Land Office.
