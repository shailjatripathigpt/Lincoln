However, if\n                  January 15 was the due date of the annual interest on the loan, and the loan was given\n                  at the ten percent per year interest rate that Lincoln typically set for his loans\n                  to others, then the original amount of the loan would have been $2,750. It is possible\n                  that Edwards credited this $80 interest payment to Lincoln’s account at N. W. Edwards\n                  & Company, for Lincoln to use toward future purchases from the store.It appears that, in January 1861, Edwards gave Lincoln two personal promissory notes\n                  totaling $1,587.90 with an interest rate of ten percent per year due from January\n                  16, 1861 onward as well as another two promissory notes from his company—by then renamed\n                  Smith, Edwards & Company—for a total of $1,000, also at an interest rate of ten percent\n                  per year, due from January 16, 1861 forward. By February 1861, Edwards had repaid\n                  him $150, and Lincoln transferred the remaining debt toRobert Irwin.Harry E.
