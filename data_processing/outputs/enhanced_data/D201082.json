According to theOttawa Republican-Timeswhich published this text, the transcription was prepared by Joseph O. Glover’s son,\n                  Henry T. Glover, who was in possession of the manuscript original at the time of its\n                  publication in 1908. The younger Glover was then preparing to bring the manuscript\n                  toOttawafor display at a celebration of the anniversary of theLincoln-Douglas Debatethat had been held there. Beneath the publication of the letter was an account of\n                  the Ottawa Lincoln-Douglas Debate written in verse by former town resident C. K. Howard,\n                  which was followed by excerpts from a letter by Henry T. Glover which included his\n                  reminiscences of the debate and of Lincoln’s visit to the Glover family home following\n                  the event.Ottawa Republican-Times(IL), 23 July 1908, 8:1-2;The Daily Inter Ocean(Chicago, IL), 11 December 1891, 2:4."

        "text": "2Lincoln’sletterto Burton C. Cook of August 2, 1858, had relayed the rumor of a movement to challengeRepublicancandidates inBureauandLa Sallecounties in upcoming elections by running independent candidates for theU.S. House of RepresentativesandIllinois General Assembly. Lincoln himself had been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of particular importance to Lincoln’s campaign. See1858 Federal Election.Gloverrespondedon behalf of an absent Cook on August 4, 1858, and expressed his confidence that\n                  Bureau and La Salle counties would elect Republicans to the Illinois General Assembly\n                  who supported Lincoln. Glover was correct in his prediction. Bureau County comprised\n                  the Forty-Seventh Illinois House District, where RepublicanJohn H. Bryantwas elected in 1858, and La Salle County was in the Forty-Third Illinois House District,\n                  in which RepublicansAlexander CampbellandRichardson S. Hickwon their races as well. Incumbent Republican Owen Lovejoy was also successful in\n                  his reelection bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Third Congressional\n                  District of Illinois, which included both counties.Allen C.
