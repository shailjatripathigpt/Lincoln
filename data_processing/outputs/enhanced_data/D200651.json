Sturgeon Proceedings of theCircuit and District Courtsof the United States atSpringfield Illinoison the death of Judge Nathaniel Pope– \"Present the Hon:Thomas Drummond– “MondayJune 3d1850 On the opening of theCourtthis morning the Hon:Abraham Lincolna member of the bar of this Court suggested the death of the Hon Nathaniel Pope late\n\na Judge of this Court, since the adjournment of the last term, Where upon in token\n\nof respect in the memory of the deceased it is ordered that the Court do now adjourn\n\nuntil tomorrow morning at 10 oclock and that the motion be entered of record.1 “Wednesday June 5th1850 On the opening of Court this morning MrWilliams, the District attorney of the United States made the following remarks, The proceedings of the Bar meeting held yesterday, have been placed in my hands this\n\nmorning with a request that I would communicate them to yourHonor. They are designed to express the sentiments of profound sorrow and regret with\n\nwhich the death of Judge Pope has impressed those who have adopted them. I need not say how sincerely I feel the\n\nmelancholy event which has deprived the Bench of an honored incumbent, the Bar of\n\na wise, judicious and affectionate Counsellor, the Community of a just man, a good Citizen, an high minded gentleman. A proper\n\nappreciation of his virtues and qualifications by those who have long known him, has\n\ndictated the tribute to his worth embodied in the resolutions which I have now the\n\nhonor to present to the Court, and respectfully ask that they may be placed upon its\n\nrecords. To which His Honor Judge Drummond responded as follows, The Court very willingly Complies with the request made on the part of the Bar. It is proper that upon the records of the Court when he a distinguished Justice for\n\nso many years, there Should be placed an enduring memorial of the worth and high qualities\n\nas a Judge and a man of the subject of your resolutions. His mind and memory are intimately connected with the political and judicial history\n\nof theState– He assisted at its admission into the Union, when admitted he was immediately appointed\n\na Judge of theCircuit^District^Courtand for more than thirty years he acted in that capacity upon all the events and acts with which he was connected during a long and\n\ndistinguished career, he impressed the stamp of his firm and decided character. It\n\nis felt now– it will be felt always While the history and reputation of our great men are the property of the Country,\n\nit is peculiarly the province and the duty of the members of your profession and of\n\nthe Courts to cherish the virtues and venerate the character of one eminent at the\n\nBar or on the Bench and to take a pride and high gratification in aiding to transmit\n\nhis name to posterity. The memory of the Judge whose virtues and services your resolutions record, will long\n\nbe preserved by the members of the Bar throughout the State, where his ability and\n\nintegrity have furnished to us all a guide and example. It is now the order of the Court, that the proceedings of the Bar be entered upon\n\nthe records of the Court and that theJudgewill wear the usual badge of mourning during the Term, as an expression of his entire\n\nconcurrence with the feelings of the Bar, Which proceedings are as follows– At a meeting of the Bar of the Bar of the Circuit and District Courts of the United States in and for the District\n\nof Illinois held in the Court room in Springfield on Monday the 3dday of June A.D. 1850 the Hon:Samuel H. TreatChief Justice of theSupreme Court of Illinoiswas appointed Chairman andE. N. PowellEsq Secretary..2 The Hon:Stephen T. Logan, the HonNorman H. Purple, the Hon:David L Gregg, The Hon. Abraham Lincoln andGeorge W MeekerEsq were appointed a Committee to prepare resolutions expressive of the sentiments and\n\nfeelings of the meeting on the melancholy event of the death of the Hon Nathaniel\n\nPope late Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Illinois.
