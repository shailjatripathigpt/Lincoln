It responded\n                  to an earlierletterfrom Tracy on behalf of the Beardstown Republican Club, inviting Lincoln to speak\n                  in Beardstown.Lincoln was running against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He and Douglas both focused their campaign\n                  efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Douglas spoke in Beardstown on August 11 and Lincoln accepted Tracy’s invitation to\n                  appear in the town, ultimately speaking in Beardstown on August 12.
