When the Tazewell County Republican\n                  convention was held inTremonton August 30, 1858,Richard N. Cullomwas selected as the party’s candidate for the race. He ran against DemocratRichard B. M. Wilson.  Cullom ultimately received 1,783 votes in the election, losing to Wilson, who earned\n                  1,955 votes.Because theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in theU.S. Senateat this time, the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere important to Abraham Lincoln, whose was running  against incumbentDemocratStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin the U.S. Senate. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts on the\n                  former Whig stronghold of centralIllinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.

Davis had visited Tazewell\n                  County earlier in August at Lincoln’s request. He believed that the biggest roadblock\n                  there was the charge ofabolitionismat Lincoln.
