        "text": "3Following receipt of this letter Lincoln filed a praecipe on May 17, 1858, in theU.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinois,  instructing the court to notify Cooper of the proceedings against him. Cooper failed\n                  to appear and the court ruled on Hamilton’s behalf on June 19, awarding him $2,289.15.\n                  Cooper was found to own no property and the sheriff was unable to execute the judgment.\n                  The firm of Wolff & Hoppe also sued Cooper in an action of assumpsit in the U.S. Circuit\n                  Court for the Southern District of Illinois in June of 1858 and were likewise unable\n                  to collect the sum awarded them by the court. Hamilton and Wolff & Hoppe instead found\n                  thirty-eight people who owed Cooper money and retained Lincoln & Herndon to institute\n                  garnishment proceedings on their behalf. Cooper apparently ultimately paid the judgments\n                  in both cases, as Lincoln & Herndon dismissed the garnishment proceedings in January\n                  of 1859.Praecipe, Document ID: 65629; Judgment Docket: 65625; Order, Document ID: 65635,Hamilton v.
