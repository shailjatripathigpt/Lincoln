        "text": "9In American law, redemption is the process by which someone recovers real property\n                  through the payment of a debt or judgment, sometimes via the repurchase of the real\n                  property after a judicial sale in which a sheriff sells the property in order to satisfy\n                  a judgment of a court.Missouri’s laws regarding mortgages—including the processes for foreclosure and redemption—are\n                  located in chapter 113 of the second volume of the 1855Revised Statutes of the State of Missouri.Per Illinois redemption law, any creditor who paid to have their court judgment recovered\n                  via the execution of a judicial sale of real property would be issued a certificate\n                  of redemption and be considered a bidder upon the sale of said property. Provided\n                  that no one bid an amount higher than what the judgment creditor paid to recover their\n                  land via judicial sale, the lands would be considered sold to the judgment creditor.\n                  If, however, someone cast a higher bid than what the judgment creditor paid for the\n                  execution of the judicial sale, the judgment creditor would simply receive all sale\n                  proceeds over and above their payment for the execution of the judicial sale.“Redemption,” “Judicial Sale,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

        "text": "10Lincoln wrote at least four more letters related to legal business that he and Herndon\n                  conducted on behalf of Samuel C. Davis & Company on three separate but similar and\n                  simultaneous cases. In this letter, Lincoln discusses two of the cases:S. C. Davis & Co. v. Campbell & HundleyandS. C. Davis & Co. v. Kinney. InS. C. Davis & Co. v. Campbell & Hundley, Isaac W. Campbell and Robert M. Hundley gave Samuel C. Davis & Company a promissory\n                  note in May 1857 for $1,000 and secured the note with a mortgage on 640 acres of land.\n                  After Campbell and Hundley failed to pay within the specified six months, Samuel C.\n                  Davis & Company retained Lincoln and Herndon and, in December 1857, sued in theU.S. Circuit Court, Southern District of Illinoisto foreclose the mortgage.  Campbell and Hundley failed to appear, and, in February\n                  1858, the court ruled for Samuel C. Davis & Company in the amount of $1,077.50 plus\n                  court costs and foreclosed the mortgage.  Samuel C. Davis & Company subsequently purchased\n                  the 640 acres at the mortgage sale for $1.94 per acre.Similarly, inS. C. Davis & Co. v. Kinney, Thomas J. Kinney gave Samuel C. Davis & Company a promissory note for $969.35 in\n                  May 1857 and secured the note with a mortgage on one hundred acres of land and a lot\n                  in Browning, Illinois.  After Kinney failed to pay, Samuel C. Davis & Company retained Lincoln and Herndon\n                  and, in December 1857, sued in the U.S. Circuit Court, Southern District of Illinois\n                  to foreclose the mortgage.  Kinney failed to appear, and, in February 1858, the court\n                  ruled for Samuel C. Davis & Company and awarded $1,044.73 plus court costs.  Kinney\n                  failed to pay the judgment, the one hundred acres were sold at public auction to recover\n                  the debt, interests, and court costs due to Samuel C. Davis & Company, and Samuel\n                  C. Davis & Company later purchased the land for $0.10 per acre and the lot for $250.Abraham Lincoln to Samuel C.
