The\n\naddress drawn up by A. Lincoln,S. T. LoganandA. T. Bledsoe, will appear in the nextWhig.2 Resolved, That a Tariff of duties on imported goods, producing sufficient Revenue, for the\n\npayment of the necessary expenditures of the National Government, and so adjusted\n\nas to protect American Industry, is indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the\n\nAmerican people. Resolved, That we are opposed to Direct Taxation for the support of the National Government. Resolved, That a National Bank, properly restricted, is highly necessary and proper to the\n\nestablishment and maintainance of a sound currency; and for the cheap and safe collection, keeping, and disbursing\n\nthe public revenue. Resolved, That the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of Public Lands, upon the principles\n\nof Clay’s bill, accords with the best interests of the Nation, and particularly with\n\nthose of the State of Illinois.3 Resolved, That we recommend to the whigs of each Congressional District of the State, to nominate\n\nand support, at theapproaching election, a candidate of their own principles, regardless of the chances of success. Resolved, That we recommend to the whigs of all portions of this State to adopt, and rigidly\n\nadhere to, the Convention System of nominating candidates. Resolved, That we recommend to the whigs of each Congressional District to hold a District\n\nConvention on or before the first Monday of May next, to be composed of a number of\n\ndelegates from each county equal to double the number of its Representatives in theGeneral Assembly,providedeach county shall have at least one delegate. Said delegates to be chosen by primary\n\nmeetings of the whigs, at such times and places as they in their respective counties\n\nmay see fit.—Said District Conventions, each, to nominate one candidate forCongress, and one delegate to a National Convention, for the purpose of nominating candidates\n\nfor President and Vice President of the United States. The seven delegates so nominated\n\nto a National Convention, to have power to add two delegates to their own number,\n\nand to fill all vacancies. Resolved, That A. T. Bledsoe, S. T. Logan, and A. Lincoln, be appointed a committee to prepare\n\nan address to the People of the State. Resolved, ThatN. W. Edwards,A. G. Henry,James H. Matheny,John C. Doremus, andJames C. Conkling, be appointed a Whig Central State Committee, with authority to fill any vacancy\n\nthat may occur in the committee. Mr. JONAS then offered the following which was received after rapturous applause and\n\nunanimously adopted: Resolved, That HENRY CLAY, ofKentucky, has the entire confidence of the people of Illinois—that as a candidate for thePresidency in 1844, he would be our choice in preference to any other distinguished Statesman of the\n\nWhig party—but acting as we do, from principle and not for men, we pledge ourselves\n\nto rally to the support of the nominee of the National Convention, hoping that the\n\nselection will fall on “Harry of the West,” the first and dearest hope of a suffering country. The following resolution was unanimously adopted– Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be signed by the President, Vice Presidents\n\nand Secretaries, and published in all the Whig papers of the State.",

        "text": "3In 1832, Henry Clay first proposed in Congress a bill to distribute among the states\n                  (especially the western states, including Illinois) the revenue from the sale of federally-owned\n                  lands. Distribution of the revenues from public lands became and remained an important\n                  part of the Whig platform. Distribution was finally passed as part of  “An Act to\n                  Regulate the Deposites of Public Money,” in June 1836. A compromise measure generally\n                  referred to as the Deposit Act or the Distribution Act, it ordered the distribution\n                  to the states in order of their population all money in the treasury on January 1,\n                  1837, in excess of $5 million; but distribution was contingent upon maintaining a\n                  tariff below 20 percent. In 1841, the tariff reached 20 percent and Clay’s distribution\n                  measure was automatically suspended.Theodore Calvin Pease,The Frontier State, 1818-1848, vol. 2 ofSesquicentennial History of Illinois(Springfield: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1918), 185-88; Robert V.
