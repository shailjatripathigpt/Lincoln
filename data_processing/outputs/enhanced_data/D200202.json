        "text": "4In November 1839, GovernorThomas Carlincalled the legislature into special session to modify the internal improvement system\n                  and deal with the state’s debt crisis brought on by thePanic of 1837. In December 1839, the state’s debt crisis forced theState Bankto suspend specie payments.   Under provisions of theincorporation actand anact supplementarythereto, if the bank did not resume specie payments within sixty days after suspension,\n                  it would lose its  charter.  In hismessageto the General Assembly, Carlin insisted that the “general disapprobation of the\n                  people to the extent of the system,” and “the  vast amount which has been and is daily\n                  expending upon costly, and at present, unnecessary work,” required modification of\n                  the internal improvement system.  He also attacked the bank and demanded an investigation\n                  of its affairs. The legislators complied by establishing a joint select committee.\n                  Despite Carlin’s hostility, the legislature passed anacton January 31, 1840, resuscitating the bank with, as Lincoln described to Stuart,\n                  “some trifling modifications.” The act revived the bank’s charter and suspending stipulations\n                  on specie payments until the end of the next legislative session. The legislature\n                  also passed anactsustaining support for theIllinois and Michigan Canal, and anactincorporating the city of Springfield and reaffirming it as the location of the seat\n                  of government.Debate over the internal improvement system proved time-consuming and contentious.\n                  After over a month of proposals and counter-proposals, in late January 1840, both\n                  houses passed abillrepealing theactcreating the internal improvement system, but the bill did not become law due to\n                  a technicality.  In the meantime, the legislature passed anactsettling the debts and liabilities of the system in preparation for its eventual\n                  termination, and anactabolishing the two governing boards, the Board of Fund Commissioners and the Board\n                  of Commissioners of Public Works.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:147;  John H.

There were\n                  at least thirty-five campaign biographies published in various languages between 1836\n                  and 1840.  Three received wide distribution and one or possibly all came into Lincoln’s\n                  hands.

In point of fact, Van Buren was a War Hawk who crafted\n                  and shepherd through many piece of war legislation, included the raising of troops.\n                  In September 1814, he authored a radical measure allowing the governor to conscript\n                  12,000 men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five to defend the state.
