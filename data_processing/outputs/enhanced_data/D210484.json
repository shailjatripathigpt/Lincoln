Lucas in urging Abraham Lincoln to go Washington, DC, to personally\n                  lobby to   become commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office.   Justin H. Butterfield,\n                  James L. D. Morrison, and Cyrus Edwards  were the first Illinoisans vying to replace\n                  Richard M. Young, the incumbent. Lincoln entered the competition after learning that\n                  Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.On June 4, Lincoln learned that the appointment had been delayed three weeks to allow\n                  him time to promote his candidacy.On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19.

        "text": "3Josiah M. Lucas wrote and signed this letter.  He also wrote the address on the last\n                  sheet.Richard M. Young,  incumbent commissioner of the General Land Office, had appointed\n                  Lucas as a temporary clerk in the Land Office in March 1849, but Lucas was worried\n                  about his tenure with rumors swirling that Young was to be replaced.  Lucas held onto\n                  his job through the spring, and he sent Lincoln a steady stream of letters informing\n                  Lincoln on the contest for commissioner and on appointments to land offices throughout\n                  Illinois.  Lucas’ name does not appear in the official register of the officers and\n                  agents of the government employed as of September 30, 1849, so he must have lost his\n                  position.  His name also does not appear in the official registers for 1851 and 1853,\n                  so apparently he did not receive another federal appointment while the Whigs held\n                  power.As Lucas hoped, Lincoln would  eventually become a candidate for the job.  Neither\n                  Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment, the job going to  Butterfield\n                  instead.
