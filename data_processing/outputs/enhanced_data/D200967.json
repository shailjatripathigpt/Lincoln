        "text": "3The suitBakewell v. Allinmay have been related to a case that Lincoln was involved with in theMcLean County Circuit Courtfrom 1851 to 1853—Campbell v. Allin. In that case, Alexander Campbell suedJames Allinin the McLean County Circuit Court for an injunction concerning a deed to certain\n                  property. Campbell retained Lincoln; Allin retainedAsahel Gridley. Although the editors ofThe Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Editionlisted Edwin W. Bakewell as a plaintiff attorney alongside Lincoln in the case, Bakewell\n                  was most likely a plaintiff alongside Campbell. In April 1853, Campbell dismissed\n                  his bill of injunction.Lincolncorrespondedwith Bakewell at least once about theCampbell v. Allincase. No further correspondence between Williams and Lincoln regarding theBakewell v. Allinsuit has been located.For additional information on the caseCampbell v. Allin, see:Campbell v. Allin, Martha L.
