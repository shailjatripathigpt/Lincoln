Douglasearlier in the day on July 29, 1858 in Monticello, written to the newspaper by an\n                  author who signed themselves “B. B.” No manuscript version of Lincoln’s remarks has\n                  been located.Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentDemocratDouglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  efforts in the 1858 election campaign on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Lincoln had been at home in Springfield the night prior to this speech, left Piatt\n                  County by train late in the evening on July 29 following his speech, and was back\n                  in Springfield on July 30.Sunday Morning Republican(St. Louis, MO), 1 August 1858, 2:4; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-58, 476-77; Allen C.\n                     Guelzo, “Houses Divided: Lincoln, Douglas, and the Political Landscape of 1858,”The Journal of American History94 (September 2007), 392-94, 400-401;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 28 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-28; 29 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-29; 30 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-30."

        "text": "2Preceding this published summary of Lincoln’s speech, theSunday Morning Republicandescribed Douglas and Lincoln meeting between Monticello and the railroad depot on\n                  July 29, as Douglas left the town having finished his speech, and Lincoln arrived\n                  to give his. On July 24, Lincoln had written to invite Douglas to a series of debates.\n                  Douglas responded to Lincoln on the same day to discuss the proposal and suggested\n                  locations for what would ultimately be   theLincoln-Douglas Debates. Several Illinois newspapers, including theChicago Daily Press and Tribuneand theIllinois State Journal, published Lincoln’s invitation and Douglas’s answer, which Lincoln read aloud here.\n                  As described in theSunday Morning Republican, when Lincoln and Douglas met on the road outside Monticello prior to this speech,\n                  Lincoln had his reply, mentioned here, prepared and offered to give it to Douglas,\n                  provided that the latter would wait for Lincoln to check the accuracy of his personal\n                  copy of the letter against the original text first. Douglas declined to wait and requested\n                  that Lincoln forward the original when he was satisfied that his retained copy was\n                  accurately transcribed. In the course of their negotiations by correspondence, the\n                  two men set locations for the debates and Lincoln promised to no longer appear or\n                  speak at any more of Douglas’ “exclusive meetings” on the campaign trail, an early\n                  campaign strategy of his which was criticized by bothRepublicansand Democrats, and which was of particular irritation to Douglas.Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.

        "text": "3In the unexcerpted portion of thisSunday Morning Republicanarticle on the electoral campaign in Piatt County, author “B. B.”  summarized Douglas’\n                  July 29, 1858 speech in Monticello as expounding forcefully on the argument that Lincoln\n                  desired full citizenship for black Americans, and that he was “in favor of negro equality\n                  under the law with the hope that he would elevate him to equality, socially, with\n                  the white man.”In a speech made in Springfield on July 17, 1858, Lincoln had previously responded\n                  to charges by Douglas that he advocated for racial equality by stating that he did\n                  not believe that people of different races were equal in all respects, but that white\n                  and black people were equally entitled to the rights guaranteed in the United States\n                  Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. Specifically, he argued that black people,\n                  although in his view inferior in color to white people, were included in the Declaration’s\n                  statement that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator\n                  with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit\n                  of Happiness.” In published reports of his July 10, 1858 speech in Chicago, in the\n                  final two paragraphs Lincoln called for an end to arguing over the relative inferiority\n                  of any men or race, and advocated unity and a recommitment to the principle that all\n                  men are created equal.Sunday Morning Republican(St. Louis, MO), 1 August 1858, 2:4; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Julian P.

        "text": "4During the campaign of 1858, Illinois Republican U.S. Senator Lyman Trumbull spoke\n                  widely in Illinois andIndianain favor of Lincoln and the Republican ticket and against Douglas. Lincoln’s schedule\n                  of campaign appearances was published beginning in August of 1858, and initially stated\n                  that Trumbull was expected to accompany him to most events. When Trumbull’s campaign\n                  schedule was ultimately published alongside Lincoln’s, no joint appearances by the\n                  two were listed. Lincoln returned to Monticello for another campaign speech on September\n                  6, 1858, apparently without Trumbull,  whose published campaign schedule spanned September\n                  and October 1858  and  listed no appearances in Monticello.Following this excerpted summary of Lincoln’s speech, author “B. B.” described Lincoln’s\n                  supporters as looking glum after his oration, and claimed Lincoln himself “plainly\n                  showed his mortification of his own failure.” “B. B.” went on to incorrectly predict\n                  a Democratic victory in Piatt County in the election of 1858. Piatt County was in\n                  the Sixteenth Illinois Senate District, where DemocratJoel S. Postheld over in 1858. The county was a part of the Thirty-Sixth Illinois House of Representatives\n                  district, where RepublicanDaniel Stickelwon election in 1858, defeating Douglas Democrat candidateWilliam N. Coler, andBuchananDemocrat candidateWilliam Pratherby several hundred votes.Ralph J.
