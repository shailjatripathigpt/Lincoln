These Republicans were unhappy with Lovejoy’sabolitionismas well as encouraged by the recent rift that Stephen A. Douglas’ criticism of PresidentJames Buchanan’s support for theLecompton Constitutioncaused within the Democratic Party. Some of Lincoln’s friends—includingT. Lyle Dickey,Ward H. Lamon, andLeonard Swett—supported this scheme, hoping to capitalize on the votes of both conservative Republicans\n                  and pro-Douglas Democrats. Through correspondence, Lincoln privatelywarnedLovejoy of these efforts and argued to fellow Republicans that support for an independent\n                  candidate would only aid the Democratic Party.Delegates to the Republican convention for Illinois’ Third Congressional District\n                  unanimously nominated Lovejoy for reelection.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 July 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-46, 456-58;Abraham Lincoln to Charles H.

The convention’s delegates\n                  nominated William N. Coler as the district’s candidate for theIllinois General Assembly. The delegates also wrote and adopted resolutions that endorsed the Democratic Party’s\n                  principles in general rather than either Stephen A. Douglas or James Buchanan in particular.\n                  The Democratic Party had recently split into pro-Buchanan and pro-Douglas factions\n                  after Douglas, in December 1857, spoke out against the Lecompton Constitution and\n                  criticized President Buchanan for supporting it. SeeBleeding Kansas.In his acceptance speech, Coler stated that he was neither pro-Douglas nor pro-Buchanan,\n                  but rather simply a Democrat. Buchanan loyalists repudiated the convention resolutions\n                  as well as Coler’s nomination. That summer, numerous newspapers reported that Coler\n                  made an agreement with local pro-Buchanan Democrats in order to secure their support,\n                  supposedly promising that, if he won election to the legislature, he would cast his\n                  vote for Douglas for U.S. senator only if directed to do so by December 1 by eitherLewis Cass, or, in the event of Cass’ death, byJohn C.

For full details\n                  on the case, seeScott v. Sandford. Lincolnrepliedto Somers on June 25.The Republicans of Illinois’ Thirty-Sixth House District ultimately nominatedDaniel Stickelrather than Peter K. Hull for a seat in theIllinois House of Representatives, as Hull had not lived in the district long enough to be eligible for office per\n                  article three, section three of the1848 Illinois Constitution. Stickel defeated Coler and Buchanan Democrat candidateWilliam Pratherby several hundred votes to win the seat.  Bateman won election as superintendent\n                  of public instruction, and voters in the Third Congressional District reelected Lovejoy\n                  to the U.S. House.State legislatures elected U.S. senators in 1858, so the outcome of elections for\n                  theIllinois Senateand Illinois House would decide the U.S. senate race.  In state elections, Republicans\n                  won a majority of the votes cast, yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the\n                  Illinois General Assembly. The final vote tally gave Democrats a majority of forty\n                  to thirty-five in the Illinois House of Representatives and a majority of fourteen\n                  to eleven in the Illinois Senate, and, ultimately, Douglas won reelection to the U.S.\n                  Senate. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the national Republican\n                  Party.Henry C.

This you know is one of the Districts relied upon for a gain\n               and it is therefore necessary that we be very cautious in our movements."
