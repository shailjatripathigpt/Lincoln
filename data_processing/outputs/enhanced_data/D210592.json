He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.

        "text": "3The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate.  James C. Holbrook cast his vote for Lincoln in all of the first\n                  seven rounds of voting. For the eighth and ninth votes, Holbrook switched his support\n                  to anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbull. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of\n                  contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for Trumbull to ensure that\n                  an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Holbrook again voted for Trumbull in\n                  the tenth round of voting, at which point Trumbull was declared the victor. See the1854 Federal Election.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
