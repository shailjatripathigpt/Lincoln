Owing to the failure of two trains, a portion of the Editorial brethren failed to\n\narrive in time to particpate in the Convention, and some returned home without visiting ourcity. There was, however, quite a number of presses represented personally and by proxy,\n\nsufficient to transact the business for which they were called.2 The session was a very harmonious one, and all went away with bright expectations\n\nfor the future. The Platform and proceedings may be found on the outside.3 At ½ past 3p.m., the Editorial Fraternity, along with a goodly number of citizens of this city, and\n\ninvited guests, repaired to the spacious dining room of theCassell House, where a sumptuous dinner had been prepared by the citizens, under the supervision\n\nof the Committee,— Capt.I. C. Pugh, Dr.H. C. Johns, Maj.E. O. Smith, and others,— Capt. Pugh, presiding. After partaking of the substantials, and etc., the meeting was\n\ncalled to order by the President, who delivered a neat and appropriate address, welcoming\n\nthe Editorial Fraternity to the hospitality of the citizens. His remarks were well\n\nreceived. Mr.Blaisdell, in behalf of the press, respond. . . as a sentiment: “The citizens ofDecatur— we fully appreciate their hospitality.” Mr.Oglesbywas then loudly called for. Mr.O. made a number of witty remarks, and concluded by toasting Mr.Abram Lincoln, as the warm and consistent friend ofIllinois, and our next candidate for theU.S. Senate.

Usreyof theIllinois State Chronicleendorsed the suggestion, and Usrey suggested a meeting at Decatur on February 22--the\n                  one hundred and twenty-fourth anniversary ofGeorge Washington’s birth.  Editors from twenty-five anti-Nebraska newspapers signed the call for a\n                  meeting.  Twelve editors arrived in time for the opening meeting.  A heavy snowstorm\n                  blocked the railroads, keeping a number from attendance, and a few others arrived\n                  too late to take part in the proceedings.Illinois State Chronicle(Decatur, IL), 14 February 1856, 2:1; Arthur Charles Cole,The Era of the Civil War 1848-1870, vol. 3 ofThe Centennial History of Illinois(Springfield, IL: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1919), 143-44; Paul Selby, “The\n                     Editorial Convention of 1856,”Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society5 (October 1912), 343-44."

        "text": "3Lincoln helped compose at least some of the planks of the platform adopted by the\n                  delegates.  Delegates opposed the further extension of slavery or its introduction\n                  into territory already free; affirmed that freedom, as defined by the Declaration\n                  of Independence, was the rule and slavery the exception; demanded restoration of theMissouri Compromise, disavowed any intention to interfere with slavery where it already existed; declared\n                  in favor of the widest possible tolerance in matters of religion, urged reform of\n                  state government, vowed to protect the nation’s public schools, and endorsed, within\n                  current naturalization law, emigration from Europe.  The education plank sought to\n                  garner support of theAmerican Party, which opposed public funding ofCatholicschools, while the religious toleration and naturalization planks represented a subtle\n                  rebuke of nativism and theKnow Nothingmovement.The convention appointed a central committee consisting of one member from each congressional\n                  district and two at-large members.  Delegates also passed a separate resolution calling\n                  for opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act to hold  state convention atBloomingtonon May 29.  Held ostensibly to nominate anti-Nebraska candidates for the upcoming\n                  state elections, theBloomington conventionbecame the founding meeting of theRepublican Partyin Illinois.
