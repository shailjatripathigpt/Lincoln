Lincoln hoped that Republican control of the General Assembly would assist him\n                  in the1858 senatorial racebetween Lincoln and the incumbentDemocrat,Stephen A. Douglas.   Nicolay lived inSpringfieldand served as the Illinois correspondent of theDemocratat the time. Lincoln’s Republicans did not gain control of the General Assembly,\n                  and Douglas retained his seat in theU.S. Senate.
