In communicating them to me, he says:“That part of the country is, in itself, as unpoetical as any spot of the earth: but\n\nstill the sight of it, with its inhabitants and its natural objects, aroused feelings\n\nin me, which were certainly poetic. Whether my expression of those feelings is poetic,\n\nis quite another question.”I think this question may be safely decided in his favor, and having procured his\n\npermission to publish them—are willing to hear the verdict of your readers. The subject of the second part was a schoolmate of the author—the son oftherich man of the little neighborhood;“at the age of nineteen,”says my friend,“he unaccountably became furiously mad, from which condition he gradually settled down\n\ninto harmless insanity. When I visited my old home in the fall of 1844, I found him\n\nstill lingering in this wretched condition.”",
