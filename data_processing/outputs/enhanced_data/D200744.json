Lincoln et al.In the case, Oldham and Hemingway, the surviving partners of Oldham, Todd and Company,\n                  which included Robert S. Todd, claimed that the company had hired Lincoln and Edwards\n                  to collect some debts for them in Illinois.  Oldham and Hemingway claimed that Lincoln,Edwards, and Kinkead (who was acting as Lincoln's attorney in Lexington, Kentucky) failed\n                  to pay them $472.54.  In June 1853, Oldham and Hemingway sued Lincoln and others in\n                  a chancery action to recover the debt.  In February 1854, after depositions Lincoln\n                  took supported the version of events he outlines in this document, Oldham and Hemingway\n                  dismissed the case.Lincoln wrote Kinkead at least three more letters in 1853 and one in 1854 related\n                  to this case.For the legal documents related to this case, including the petition Lincoln mentions\n                     above, seeOldham & Hemingway v.
