        "text": "2Lincoln was the Republican Party candidate forU.S. Senatein 1858.  He ran against, and lost to,Stephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.The moralizing tone of the Republican platform to stop the spread of slavery led many\n                  German-Americans to push for the party to defend immigrants. However, the Republican\n                  Party needed both the German votes and the votes of formerAmerican Partymembers to win in1858. These two groups possessed decidedly opposing viewpoints, with the nativism of the\n                  American Party directing its anger at immigrants such as the Germans. Lincoln was\n                  not a supporter of nativism and in alettertoJoshua F. Speedin 1855 he wrote, \"How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor\n                  of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to\n                  be pretty refined.\"In Gustave P. Koerner'sreplyto this letter, he writes to Lincoln that a visit from Fredrich K. F. Hecker would\n                  be unlikely to do much good because he could not win over political opponents, some\n                  of whom considered him to be the Anti-Christ. Lincoln relented,writing, \"I suppose your judgement is best–\" Nevertheless, Hecker did speak to German Americans\n                  on behalf of Lincoln and other Republican candidates at several locations inIllinoisduring thecampaign, including a nearly two-hour speech in Chicago on October 23, 1858.Alison Clark Efford, \"Abraham Lincoln, German-Born Republicans, and\n                     American Citizenship,\"Marquette Law Review93  (Summer 2010): 1376-78; Sabine Freitag,Friedrich Hecker: Two Lives for Liberty,  trans. by Steven Rowan (St. Louis: St. Louis Mercantile Library, University of\n                     Missouri–St. Louis, 2006), 199; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:432, 458, 547;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 15 October 1858, 1:1; 26 October 1858, 1:4;The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 27 October 1858, 2:1."

Describing Lincoln's view\n                  of the Dred Scott decision, Douglas said, \"He (Lincoln) thinks it is wrong because\n                  it deprives the negro of the privileges, immunities and rights of citizenship, which\n                  pertain, according to the decision, only to the white man.\" Describing the U.S. government,\n                  Douglas noted, \"It was made by white men for the benefit of white men, to be administered\n                  by white men  in such a manner as  they should determine.\" Although conceding that\n                  any \"inferior race\" should have \"all the rights and all the privileges and all the\n                  immunities which he is capable of exercising consistent with the safety of society,\"\n                  Douglas insisted that each state had a right to determine the nature and extent of\n                  those rights for itself.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 10 July 1858, 1:4."
