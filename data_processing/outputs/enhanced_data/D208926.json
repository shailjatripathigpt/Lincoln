        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln enclosed this letter in aletterhe wrote to Secretary of StateJohn M. Claytonon September 12, 1849, in which he endorsed Hart Fellows as “worthy” of either a\n                  judgeship  or appointment as secretary of theOregon Territory, while also stipulating thatSimeon Franciswas his personal choice for the latter.PresidentZachary TaylorhadappointedLincoln secretary of the Oregon Territory August 9, 1849, less than a month after\n                  he appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsinIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln the position of  secretary of\n                  the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. In aletterto Clayton dated August 21, 1849, Lincoln declined the appointment for secretary\n                  of the Oregon Territory and recommended Francis for the position instead. In the end,\n                  Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhioto the position.On September 20, 1849, in a final effort to ease any tensions caused by Butterfield’s\n                  appointment, the Taylor administration also offered Lincoln appointment as governor\n                  of the Oregon Territory. After serious consideration of this offer, Lincoln also turned\n                  this position down, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Fellows’ name does not appear in the official registers for the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so apparently he did not receive any other\n                  appointment.Francis’ name also does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently he did\n                  not receive any other appointment during this period. The 1861 official register shows\n                  Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1855(Washington, DC: A.
