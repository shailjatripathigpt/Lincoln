It will urge\n\nthe holding of a Whig\n\nNational Convention, for the purpose of nominating candidates for the Presidency and\n\nVice Presidency,\n\nand will battle with all the ability, zeal and energy it can command, to secure the\n\ntriumphant election\n\nof the nominees of that Convention.

DIE WOCHENTLICHEN NEUIGKEITEN. A Weekly German Newspaper, devoted to the advocacy of sound Whig principles, and to\n\nthe dissemination of\n\nlocal, foreign and domestic intelligence, will be published from and after the first\n\nof March next. The\n\ngreat necessity for the publication of such a paper upon the Atlantic sea-board, will\n\nat once be\n\nrecognized, and the publishers have therefore determined upon establishing a paper\n\nwhich will be worthy\n\nthe confidence and support of their German fellow citizens. Our political opponents have established several German Daily and Weekly Newspapers\n\nin the cities ofNew\n\nYorkand Philadelphia, through which incalculable injury has been done our principles\n\nand cause. To\n\ncounteract these effects will be our constant purpose. We aim to make a vigorous and\n\nracy campaign\n\npaper, and being on the eve of an importantPresidential contest, we think it can be circulated to great\n\nadvantage among our German fellow citizens—Pennsylvania,Ohio,Indiana, and the several other\n\nWestern States and Territories—which large numbers of Germans have settled, and are\n\nstill\n\nsettling for permanent residence. Such a paper is the more necessary, from the fact\n\nthat the Whigs have\n\nno German paper in the Atlantic cities, and Germans who do not read English, are compelled\n\nto look to\n\nopposition papers for the news of the day. The subscription price for a single copy will be One Dollar and Fifty Cents per annum. Four copies, ordered at the same time, and addressed to the same Post-office, will\n\nbe furnished for Five\n\nDollars per annum. Ten copies and more, ordered at the same time, and addressed to the same Post-office,\n\nat the rate of One Dollar a copy per annum. In no case will the Daily, Tri-weekly, or Weekly News, or Die Wochentlichen Neuigkeiten,\n\nbe forwarded,\n\nunless payment be made in advance; and no paper will be sent after the expiration\n\nof the time, unless\n\nthe subscription is renewed. Money remitted through the mail, will be at the risk of the publishers. Notes of all\n\nspecie paying\n\nBanks, in any part of the Union, will be received in pay. Subscribers' Names.Post Office.Daily.Tri-Weekly.Weekly.German Weekly.2 Knowing you to be an active Whig, we take the liberty of\n\nsending you our Prospectuses, and shall feel ourselves under great obligations to\n\nyou, if you will\n\ninterest yourself in securing us a list of names in your neighbourhood. The cause\n\nin which we are\n\nengaged demands our best exertions, and we know of no method better calculated to\n\nadvance it, than cheap\n\nand vigorous papers.
