Gage is apparently responding to\n                  a letter from Abraham Lincoln dated November 27, 1854, assessing Gage’s support of\n                  Lincoln’s candidacy for U.S. Senate.  Lincoln wrote letters to several people in late-November\n                  soliciting support for his Senate candidacy  and received responses to these inquiries\n                  in early December 1854.   LincolnwroteElihu B.  Washburne that he received a response from Gage about December 8, giving\n                  further credence to a date of December 4.Abraham Lincoln to Thomas J.

He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first).  As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S.\n                  Senate seats.The state’s voters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  in which Lincoln also won a seat. However, in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. The Illinois General Assembly met in\n                  a joint session on February 8, 1855, to elect Illinois’s next U.S. Senator. Gage proved\n                  to be correct that in the first round of voting the majority of legislators from his\n                  neighboring counties in the northern portion of Illinois voted for Lincoln, including\n                  representatives  fromBoone,Carroll,Cook,Jo Daviess,Kane,Lake, McHenry,Ogle,Stephenson,Whiteside, andWinnebagocounties, as well as senators from Kane, Stephenson, and Winnebago counties. The\n                  state senator from Cook County,Norman B. Judd, was an exception to this pattern, supporting instead his   fellow anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbull. For the first eight rounds of voting Gage himself also voted for Lincoln, but in\n                  the ninth round he switched his support to Trumbull.  Trumbull won the senate seat\n                  on the tenth vote after Lincoln urged his remaining supporters to vote for Trumbull.Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.
