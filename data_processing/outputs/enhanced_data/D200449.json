        "text": "3In 1826, theGallatin CountyProbate Court awarded John Lane over $1,000 due him byChristopher Robinson’s estate. The court failed to execute the judgment, and in 1841, Lane sued the estate’s\n                  heirs,WilliamandNancy Dorman, who were represented by Samuel D. Marshall. In September 1842, theGallatin County Circuit Courtruled for Lane, and the Dormans retained Lincoln to appeal to theIllinois Supreme Court. The Supreme  Court ruled for the Dormans, basing its opinion upon Lincoln’s arguments.\n                  Lincoln also successfully  represented the Dormans in another Supreme Court appeal\n                  following a second attempt by Robinson’s estate and heirs to collect the debt. In\n                  February 1845, the Dormans signed a bond promising to convey to  Lincoln a one-third\n                  interest in 160 acres of the Robinson estate’s land if they won the case. Lincoln\n                  never took possession of the land, and in 1853, he andMary Lincolnsold the land to Dorman for $100.For previous letters concerning the Dorman case, seeAbraham Lincoln to Samuel D.
