Bromwell to Abraham Lincoln, 18 September 18581 Hon.Abraham Lincoln:—Though oft welcomed before by the citizens ofColes, yet now a thousand times more welcome to the friends of free thought, free speech,\n\nfree labor and free Constitutions through this portion of ourState, when they hail you as the champion of these principles in thisunparalleled contest, which brings such profit to our cause and honor to yourself. These friends have\n\nhonored me with the commission which I now so gladly but so imperfectly fulfill of\n\npresenting you, through my voice, the accumulated welcome of assembled thousands.2 There are those among us who have witnessed your course from dawning manhood till\n\nthis hour. If they have marked with satisfaction your course in the walks of integrity\n\nand independence, they feel the more pride now in hailing you as the fit standard\n\nbearer of the greatRepublicanphalanx which supports those principles only which are born to the eternal years\n\nof God. You, as well I, and thousands among our numbers, deem it no dishonor that\n\nwe owe to honest labor all the position, whatever it may be, which we occupy among\n\nour fellows. Hence we strive for the elevation of labor to no second position in\n\nhonor in our Republic. We have seen you shedding lustre on this principle, and bringing free labor to the level of the occupations of the\n\nforum. We seek now to commission you as one who may assist in maintaining it side\n\nby side with the dignity of theSenate! These laudable aims are being thwarted by the introduction of principles repugnant\n\nto the enlightened sentiments of freemen. A double-headed opposition, warring in\n\nits own members as to the mode, unites to crush the right—but we recognize in this\n\nonly the continuation of that war against true freedom which has always existed, and\n\nin which there is no discharge, yet still we anticipate triumph when the bright standards\n\nof truth shall sweep the dark shadows of error from the portals of her broad pavillion, when the congregated majorities of our land shall join with that ofIllinoisin treading the winepress of public indignation, in which alike all factions of enemies\n\nto the people shall mingle their blood.3I again welcome you to our hospitalities.

        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln traveled fromMattoontoCharlestonfor the fourthLincoln-Douglas Debateon September 18, 1858, escorted by a large procession. When he arrived at the Capitol\n                  House,Henry P. H. Bromwellwelcomed him with this speech. At 2:45 that afternoon, Lincoln opened the debate.In June 1858, theIllinois Republican Conventionnominated Abraham Lincoln to challengeStephen A. Douglasfor the U.S. Senate. Lincoln invited Douglas to a series of debates on July 24, setting\n                  the stage for what would become one of the most famous local political contests in\n                  U.S. history and a precursor to the1860 presidential election. Prior to theseven debatesbetween Lincoln and Douglas, Lincoln had already made sixty-three speeches in 1858,\n                  and Douglas claimed to have made 130. Douglas, the incumbent, was more widely known\n                  than Lincoln and had the numeric advantage of theDemocratsin theIllinois General Assembly, which selected U.S. senators in those days. He also represented a divided party\n                  and faced a growing population in northernIllinoisthat was hostile to slavery. Lincoln, on the other hand, had the advantage of a united\n                  Republican Party, a growing antipathy toward slavery in the state, and a reputation\n                  for integrity. Nevertheless, his views on racial issues were unpopular, as was his\n                  stand on theMexican War. The debates would highlight the fundamental differences in the men’s characters\n                  and focus on the main issues of the day, the expansion of slavery and racial equality.\n                  While the immediate effect of the debates was the reelection of Douglas, the long-term\n                  results were the opposite. Lincoln was catapulted to national prominence, allowing\n                  him to run for president in 1860, and Douglas’s campaign against Lincoln diminished\n                  his chances of future success.

        "text": "3Bromwell is likely referring to the Republican belief that Douglas and the Democrats\n                  were attempting to nationalize slavery. Lincoln believed that the passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actin 1854, establishing popular sovereignty as a means of deciding slave status for\n                  southwestern territories, was part of a larger conspiracy to make slavery perpetual\n                  and national. During his nomination at the 1858 Illinois Republican Convention, Lincoln\n                  delivered an address—widely known as his “House Divided” speech—in which he charged\n                  that Douglas was part of a plot or conspiracy to nationalize slavery. Lincoln argued\n                  that the plot began with Douglas’s Kansas-Nebraska bill, which PresidentFranklin Piercesupported, then was advanced by both theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in theDred Scott case—handed down byRoger B. Taney—and by PresidentJames Buchanan’s call to support the court’s decision. Lincoln warned his audience that, if Douglas\n                  were not defeated and the slave power not overthrown, another Supreme Court ruling\n                  could build upon the Dred Scott decision and proclaim that the U.S. Constitution prohibited\n                  states from excluding slavery within their own borders.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life,  1:458-61; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 206-9."
