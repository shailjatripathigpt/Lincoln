He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, his name\n                  began to circulate as a possible nominee to supplant Democratic incumbent James Shields\n                  as U.S. Senator.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate.

        "text": "6In the election of 1854, voters  elected Robert Boal, Thomas J. Henderson, and Henry\n                  Grove to the Illinois House of Representatives and John D. Arnold to theIllinois Senate, making  their preferences for a senatorial candidate also important for Lincoln\n                  to know. They were all from Illinois’ Fourth Congressional District, which appears\n                  to be the district Ramsey references. In the Illinois General Assembly, however, Arnold\n                  represented Illinois’ Eighth Senate District, Grove and Henderson represented Illinois’\n                  Forty-First House District, and Boal represented the state’s Forty-Second House District.No correspondence between Arnold and Lincoln has been located, although LincolnaskedElihu N. Powellif he should write to Arnold directly after PowellassuredLincoln that Boal, Henderson, Grove, and Arnold were all “good Whigs and I think\n                  all are for you.”   Boal pledged his support to Lincoln in aletterhe wrote Lincoln on November 15. A few days later, Grove alsowroteLincoln, stating that although he preferred Lincoln to other candidates he wanted\n                  to know more about Lincoln’s views on slavery. In a December 11letter, Henderson wrote that he considered Lincoln’s chances for election as senator  best,\n                  but that he also consideredArchibald Williamsa worthy candidate.Ultimately, Lincoln did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General\n                  Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Both Day and Strawn cast their initial votes for Lincoln, but then each\n                  switched to other candidates—Day voted for Sweet twice before switching to Trumbull,\n                  and Strawn voted for Trumbull and thenWilliam B. Ogdenbefore switching back to Trumbull. Arnold voted for Lincoln for eight ballots, before\n                  switching to Trumbull. Boal, Grove, and Henderson all cast their votes for Lincoln\n                  on nine ballots. At this point in the proceedings—with his share of votes declining\n                  and concerned that Illinois GovernorJoel A. Mattesonhad convinced Strawn, Day, and others to switch their final votes to him—Lincoln\n                  dropped out of contention and urged his supporters to vote for Trumbull in order to\n                  ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. Boal, Grove, and Henderson\n                  heeded Lincoln’s directive and switched their votes to Trumbull on the final ballot.\n                  See the1854 Federal Election.Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 2 January 1855, 2:3; Howard W.
