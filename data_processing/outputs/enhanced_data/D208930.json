He had been in Chicago since July 7, 1850, for the trial ofZebulon ParkerversusCharles Hoytat theU.S. District Courtin the city. The trial, which began on July 9th, revolved around Hoyt’s alleged infringement\n                  of Parker’s copyright on a waterwheel. Lincoln represented Hoyt in the case. The trial\n                  lasted until July 24th, with Lincoln and Hoyt emerging victorious.On July 22, 1850, Lewis C. Kercheval,Buckner S. Morris,George W. Dole,John H. Kinzie, andWalter L.
