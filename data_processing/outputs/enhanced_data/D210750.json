        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted were those who had moved into theAmerican Partyfollowing the dissolution of the Whig Party.Despite Lundy’s concerns, the Illinois counties of Putnam, Marshall, and La Salle\n                  were among the northern Illinois counties assumed to be strongly Republican in 1858,\n                  and that proved to be the case in theelection of that year. Putnam and Marshall counties were in the Eighth Illinois Senate District, where\n                  RepublicanGeorge C. Bestordefeated Democrat William S. Moss. The two counties were in the Forty-Second Illinois House District,\n                  which elected RepublicanJohn A. McCallover Democrat Washington E. Cook.  La Salle County was located in the Seventh Illinois\n                  Senate District, where RepublicanBurton C. Cookheld over in the election of 1858, and was in the Forty-Third Illinois House District,\n                  in which RepublicansAlexander CampbellandRichardson S. Hickdefeated Democratic candidates Samuel C. Collins and William Cogswell.Allen C.

In a subsequentletterto Lincoln  of July 20, 1858, Lundy referred to Lincoln having indicated that he\n                  would attend a mass meeting of Republicans of Putnam, Marshall, and La Salle Counties\n                  if called on or after August 20, 1858 and informed Lincoln that such a meeting had\n                  been scheduled for Friday, August 20. Lincoln received a furtherletterdated August 10, 1858 from Lundy on the subject, in which Lundy reiterated that August\n                  20 had been set as the date for the mass meeting; Lincoln docketed that letter with\n                  a note that his appearance at such a meeting was “Not to be.” In the midst of Lundy’s\n                  correspondence with Lincoln regarding the date of the proposed mass meeting, the schedule\n                  had been set for a series ofdebatesbetween Lincoln and Douglas. The first of these debates was scheduled for Saturday,\n                  August 21, 1858 inOttawa, and rather than appearing in Magnolia on August 20 as Lundy proposed, Lincoln delivered\n                  a speech inPeoriaon August 19, then spent the night of the 20th inMorrisin order to reach Ottawa the following day.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 28 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-28; 19 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-19; 20 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-20; 21 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-21; Stephen A.
