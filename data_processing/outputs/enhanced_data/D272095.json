Myself and many others were of the latter number. But, without any of the clap-traps\n\nto draw a crowd, at least 2,500mengathered this afternoon,3in close column, to hear honestAbe Lincolnscatter to the winds all of the sophisms in Douglas’ vaunted advocacy of popular\n\nsovereignty—to hear him vindicate true Republican principles, and to put to shame\n\nby his candid, fair and gentlemanly argument, the coarse, personal assaults of Douglas.\n\nThatSenator’s unmanly and gross charge of “liar” and “coward,” were made only to recoil upon\n\nthe head of their author.4Among the hearers were about one hundred delegates and double this number of other\n\nRepublicans who came up to the Congressional Convention from the ten counties composing\n\nthe 4th district;5and besides, gentlemen fromChicagoand from counties out of the district were present. Numbers of Germans, few of whom\n\nwere in attendance yesterday, were eager listeners to Lincoln’s speech. Old lineWhigsandFillmore menwere also present, and by their hearty cheers, testified to their appreciation of\n\nthe arguments. The mottoes on the principal banners around the stand seemed to express\n\nthe feelings of the multitudes: “Abraham Lincoln, the choice ofIllinois,” and “William Kellogg, the honest Representative.” A drizzling rain, which continued\n\nthroughout the afternoon doubtless prevented the attendance of many ladies, and even\n\nmen, who would have thus swelled the crowd. But notwithstanding the rain, the speaking\n\ncontinued all the afternoon. Being unaccustomed to reporting speeches, I am unable\n\nto give you such an outline of it as would do justice to its eloquence, its logic,\n\nits impartiality, and its truthfulness.6It is said by those who have heard other efforts of Mr. Lincoln during thecampaign, to have been more impressive, and delivered with more vehemence than any preceding\n\nit. Of its effects upon the minds of all, I can have no doubt; even manyDouglasiteswho heard it, were pleased, and they recognized in the speaker a true man and a patriotic\n\nstatesman.7",

At the time, Lincoln was the Illinois Republican Party’s candidate to unseatDemocraticincumbent Stephen A. Douglas in theU.S. Senate. He and Douglas both canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858,\n                  delivering speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Because members of the General Assembly voted for and\n                  elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the U.S. Senate race.
