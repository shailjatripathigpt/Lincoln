The second excerpt\n                  is from the ninth paragraph.Morgan CountyWhigs hosted the barbecue as the payment for Sangamon County in giving the largest\n                  Whig majority for John J. Hardin at the  Congressional election in August 1843. In\n                  the winter of 1842-43,Abraham Lincolnsought nomination to run as a Whig for the congressional seat in the Seventh District.Edward D. Baker, however, got the endorsement of the Sangamon County Whigs. At the district convention\n                  in May, John J. Hardin would defeat Baker for the nomination.Lincolnproposedthe idea of a barbecue on May 11, 1843.  In aletterto Hardin written on  the same day, Lincoln stated that he “got up the proposal,”\n                  likely in an effort to galvanize Whig voters who would have preferred the nomination\n                  of Baker.Abraham Lincoln to John J.
