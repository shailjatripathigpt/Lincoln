Speed was worried about Edward D. Baker’s response because\n                  he had elicited John J. Crittenden’s views on Lincoln, Baker, and other Illinois men,\n                  and apparently Crittenden did not think highly of Baker.  Speed did not want to crush\n                  Baker’s hopes for a position."
