        "text": "4Lincoln was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to supplant incumbentStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senate. Republican state committee members selected Lincoln as the party’s candidate because\n                  they believed that a Republican with solid connections to theWhig Partyand moderate views on slavery would have the broadest appeal and allow them to capture\n                  the votes of both those who had voted forJohn C. Fremontand those who voted for Fillmore in the presidential election of 1856.At the time, members of the Illinois General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, so the outcome of the races for the Illinois House\n                  and the Illinois Senate were highly relevant to the outcome of thestate’s U.S. Senate race.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

        "text": "6The Republicans of DeWitt County actually held their convention in Clinton on July\n                  18, not July 17.There is no evidence that Lincoln attended the DeWitt County Republican Convention\n                  in Clinton on July 18. He delivered speeches in bothAtlanta, IllinoisandSpringfield, Illinoison July 17, and was likely inMacon County, Illinoison July 19.Weldon was correct that central Illinois was highly competitive ground in 1858. This\n                  fact drove both Lincoln and Douglas to focus the bulk of their campaigns on counties\n                  in the center of the state. This included DeWitt County and Clinton, where Lincoln\n                  delivered an address on September 2—at theinvitationof Weldon and other Republicans in Clinton.In the local elections of 1858, voters in the Sixteenth Illinois Senate District reelected\n                  incumbent pro-Douglas Democrat Joel S. Post and voters in the Thirty-Sixth Illinois\n                  House  District elected RepublicanDaniel E. Stickel. Ultimately, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-DouglasDemocratsretained control of the Illinois General Assembly and Douglas won reelection in the1858 Federal Election. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.The Central Transcript(Clinton, IL), 23 July 1858, 2:4.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, July 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=7; Allen C.
