        "text": "2Lincoln references the state elections inIllinois, which occurred on November 2, 1858. Lincoln, the candidate of theRepublican Party, was challengingStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for seat in theU.S. Senate. Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat. See1858 Federal Election;1858 Illinois Republican Convention.In the state’s local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly and Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Allen C.

        "text": "3On July 7, 1858, Lincolnwroteto his former congressional colleague John J. Crittenden ofKentuckyto ask whether rumors of Crittenden’s support for Douglas were true.  An eminent\n                  formerWhig, Crittenden was widely regarded as the natural successor toHenry Clay, and Lincoln worried that a Crittenden endorsement for Douglas would hurt his chances\n                  with his former Whig brethren in Illinois. Crittenden welcomed Lincoln's rise to political\n                  prominence, but had little sympathy with the Republican Party. Crittendenrespondedon July 29, assuring Lincoln that he was remembered favorably. Crittenden explained,\n                  however, that he and Douglas, though always belonging to different political parties\n                  and \"opposed, in politics, to each other,\" shared a strong aversion to theLecompton Constitution. TheBuchananadministration's harsh response to Douglas’s opposition to the Lecompton Constitution\n                  and use of its power to prevent his reelection brought sympathy from Crittenden. He\n                  wrote of Douglas, \"I could not but wish for his success— and his triumph over such\n                  a persecution– I thought that his re-election was necessary as a rebuke to the Administration,\n                  and a vindication of the great cause of popular rights & public justice.\" Crittenden\n                  admitted that he had shared his support of Douglas in various conversations but that\n                  he had only sent a handful of letters in which \"Mr Douglas was alluded to and recommended.\"\n                  Going forward, he wrote, he could not promise anything, only that, \"Whatever my future\n                  course may be, I trust that I shall so act as to give no just cause of offence to\n                  any candid & liberal friend, even tho' he may differ with me in opinion.\"Though expressing \"no disposition for officious intermeddling\" in hisletterto Lincoln, Crittenden nonetheless became embroiled in the campaign for the U.S.\n                  Senate. On July 19,T. Lyle Dickey, a former Whig and Lincoln supporter who had defected to the Democrats and Douglas,\n                  wrote Crittenden requesting that he confirm a conversation with Dickey in April 1858\n                  where Crittenden praised Douglas. On August 1, Crittenden wrote Dickey confirming\n                  the conversation and his praise for Douglas's service to Illinois and his principled\n                  position on the Lecompton Constitution. Not wishing to be appear \"to be an officious\n                  intermeddler\" in the election, Crittenden requested that Dickey, should he speak of\n                  the conversation or letter, \"acquit me of any intermeddling, or of the presumption\n                  of seeking to obtrude myself or my sentiments upon the attention of the people of\n                  Illinois.\" Dickey kept the letter private until October 19, when he read it aloud\n                  in a speech denouncing Lincoln for abandoning Clay and Whiggery. TheDaily Illinois State Journalsought to mitigate the damage by claiming that Crittenden's letter to Dickey was\n                  a forgery and by suggesting that Crittenden had written Lincoln--presumably Crittenden'sletterof July 29--supporting opposition against Douglas. TheDaily Missouri Republicandemanded that Lincoln publish this letter. TheIllinois State Journalcontinued to misrepresent Crittenden's correspondence to Lincoln, prompting Owen\n                  G. Cates ofSaint  Louisto write Crittenden asking if he wrote such a letter. On October 28, Crittenden responded\n                  in a telegram: \"I have written no such letter.\" Crittenden's letter to Dickey, Dickey's\n                  speech, and Crittenden's subsequent telegram hurt Lincoln in the old Whig stronghold\n                  of Central Illinois, contributing to Lincoln's loss to Douglas.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445, 456-57, 542-43, 546-47; Allen C.
