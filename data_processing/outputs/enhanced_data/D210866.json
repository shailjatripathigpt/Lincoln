TheMissouri Democratsupported Douglas and his opposition toelection fraudsinKansas. However, when Douglas celebrated the election of Barret, a supporter of theLecompton Constitution, in August 1858,  the newspaper changed course. Barret had run as a regularDemocraticnominee rather than as ananti-LecomptonDemocrat, prompting one newspaper to claim that this proved that Douglas’s rejection\n                  of the Lecompton Constitution, “was but a ruse to pull the wool over the eyes of Republicans\n                  andAmericans, and thus secure their votes  for his reelection to theSenate.” Accusations of fraud soon appeared, and Blair contested Barret’s win. After a lengthy\n                  examination, the House of Representatives ordered a new election for the remainder\n                  of Barret’s term. While Barret remained in his seat to finish out his term per the\n                  new election, Blair defeated him for the next term in office.Abraham Lincoln was theRepublican Partycandidate for U.S. Senate in 1858. He ran against, and lost to,Stephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.

Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  efforts during thecampaign of 1858on the formerWhig Partystronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Lincoln spoke inEdwardsville, in Madison County, on the afternoon of September 11, 1858. That evening he spoke\n                  in Highland, a city with large numbers of German immigrants. In addition, the seventh\n                  debate between Lincoln and Douglas occurred inAlton, Madison County, on October 15.Despite Lincoln’s visits to Madison County, located in the  Eighth Illinois Congressional\n                  District, Democrats swept to victory there. In the 1858 congressional election, Democratic\n                  candidatePhillip B. Foukedefeated Republican candidateJehu Bakerwith 57.2 percent of the vote to 41.8 percent, with Madison  giving Fouke 51.2 percent\n                  of the vote to 48.1 percent for Baker. In elections for theIllinois General Assembly, DemocratSamuel A. Buckmasterfrom Madison County beatJoseph Gillespieby 184 votes in theSenaterace.
