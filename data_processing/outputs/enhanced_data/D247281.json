        "text": "13These amendments sparked a long battle in theHouse of Representativesover post roads and routes legislation arising out of the aftermath of theMexican War.    On February 29, 1848, the House Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads introducedH.R.260to establish post routes.   The House re-submitted thebillto the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, and on May 16, the committee\n                  reported back thebill with amendments.   Included in thisamended billwere these amendments, which included a supplemental section  adding postal routes\n                  inTexasto theRio Grande River.  This section generated heated debate about the border of Texas.  These debates\n                  led to disagreements about the geographical extent of American acquisitions from the\n                  Mexican War, and theWilmot Proviso--disagreements  that threatened to scuttle the entire legislation.  On May 30, the\n                  House re-committed the bill to the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads. On\n                  June 14, the committee reported back thebill with further amendments.  The committee retained most of these amendments in thebill as amended.  The House further amended the bill, and ordered thebillengrossed.  SeveralWhigrepresentatives moved to re-consider the vote upon engrossment, arguing in part that\n                  thebill as engrossedcontained provisions extending the boundary of Texas toSanta Feand the Upper Rio Grande--territory in dispute claimed by what would become theNew Mexico Territory.  Endorsement of Texas’ claim to a boundary on the Rio Grande would have allowed\n                  slavery to move further west into acquisitions fromMexico, blunting the Wilmot Proviso.  The House delayed action on re-consideration until\n                  June 21, whenWilliam L. Goggin, chairman of the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, proposed a proviso\n                  disavowing any opinion on the boundary issue as a means to save thebill.  This led to additional debate, and the House refused to re-consider the engrossment\n                  by a vote of 88 yeas to 87 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The House also refused\n                  to table the bill, with Lincoln voting nay.    Additional debate occurred on June\n                  26, but the House never read the bill a third time.Most of these amendments were also included inH.R. 599, which Lincoln introduced on behalf of the Committee on the Post Office and Post\n                  Roads on July 19.H.R. 599was largely the same bill asH.R 260 as engrossed, with the exception of a proviso added at the end as follows: “Provided, That nothing\n                  in this act contained, shall be so construed as to express any opinion as to the true\n                  boundary of any State or Territory therein named.”  The House amended thebillby inserting provisions for routes inNew JerseyandNew York, and passed it as amended.  Lincoln moved to re-consider the vote, but the House\n                  tabled his motion.  On August 11, theSenateapproved thebill with amendments.  The House approved twenty-six of the Senate amendments, approved one with amendments,\n                  and disagreed with six others.  The Senate, on August 12, accepted the House amendment\n                  to their amendment and receded from those the House rejected.  Theact, which included the proviso about boundaries in section two and routes in Texas to\n                  the Rio Grande,  became law on August 14.U.S. HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 467, 803, 855, 894-95, 916, 931-34, 955, 1069, 1261,\n                     1267, 1272, 1282;  U.S. SenateJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 480, 548, 555, 560, 568-72, 579, 580;Cong.
