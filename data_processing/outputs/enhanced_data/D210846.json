        "text": "6Lincolnrepliedto Sympson on August 11. He also wrote Sympson at least two additional letters related\n                  to the elections of 1858.The Republicans of Illinois’ Fifth Congressional District indeed held their congressional\n                  convention in Augusta on August 25. Delegates to the convention nominatedJackson Grimshawas the Republican candidate for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. After\n                  the convention, Lincoln delivered an address in Augusta, then traveled toMacomb, Illinois, to deliver another address the same day.In the case of Barret’s election over Blair in St. Louis, Blair ultimately won his\n                  bid for a new election. The new election was both for the U.S. House term remaining\n                  at the time of the new election, plus for the next term. Voters elected Barret to\n                  the shorter, remaining term and Blair to the new term. Barret served March 4, 1859\n                  to June 8, 1860, then Blair succeeded Barret.In the end, in the local elections of 1858, Democrat Morris beat both Grimshaw and\n                  Davis for  the Fifth Congressional District’s seat in the U.S. House, winning 52.7\n                  percent of the vote to Grimshaw’s 45.4 percent and Davis’ 1.96 percent. Pro-Douglas\n                  DemocratJohn P. Richmondwon the state’s Eleventh Senate District seat in the Illinois Senate. As Lincolnnotedin an October 24 letter to Sympson, some Democrats may have deliberately offered\n                  and promoted Davis as a national, pro-Buchanan candidate in exchange for the local\n                  election of pro-Douglas candidates such as Richmond. When the time came, Richmond\n                  cast his ballot for Douglas for U.S. senator. Although Republicans won a majority\n                  of all votes cast in Illinois in the local elections that year, pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the Illinois General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection to the\n                  U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Abraham Lincoln to Alexander Sympson; Abraham Lincoln to Alexander Sympson;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 28 August 1858, 2:3;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 25 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-25;Summary of Speech at Augusta, Illinois;Summary of Speech at Macomb, Illinois;Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1996, 622-23, 669; Howard W.
