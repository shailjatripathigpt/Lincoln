    "full_text": "Report of Speech at Vandalia, Illinois, 23 September 18561 About one o’clock preparations were made to commence speaking. The air was so chilly\n\nthat it was thought best not to occupy the stand erected, and as no room could be\n\nprocured which would hold those assembled, a temporary stand was erected against the\n\nsouthern wall of the State House. Mr.Brosswas first called for. He began in a humorous and conciliatory strain to remove any\n\nprejudice which might be felt towards him as coming from a distance, and particularly\n\nfrom the “infected district” ofChicago,2and while speaking with pride of that robust metropolis of the North-West, at the\n\nsame time spoke in terms of high and just praise of the beauty and fertility of SouthernIllinois, and ofCairo, its future metropolis. Having thus “cleared the deck,” he began the action by establishing his consistency\n\nas a life-longDemocratcompelled to break hands with the squad who had deserted the ranks and borne off\n\nthe old Democratic standard with them. He showed how the two old parties agreed on\n\nthis question of slavery-extension.3(At this point a man with a red face and green goggles rose up exclaiming in the\n\nargumentative style of our opponents, “You’re aBlack Republican.” Mr.B. called after him good-naturedly, to return andlisten, but failing to recover the man, who walked sturdily away, he told a story which\n\nsent a short volley of laughter after him, and continued his argument. He closed\n\nhis address by a tribute toCol. Fremont, so earnest and so truthful that the audience were moved like a forest under a strong\n\nwind.4 Hon.Ab. Lincoln, the veteranWhigorator of Illinois, having now arrived, was next called out.5He began by saying that a few days previously, passing throughVandaliato an appointment of his own, he learned that a Demoeratic meeting was in progress in the square and came up.6The speaker on the stand was one of his earliest political and personal friends,\n\nMr.Davis, known in those parts as “Long Jim Davis.”Long Jimat the meeting referred to paid him Mr. (L.) particular attention, and Mr. L., a gentleman of the old school, now proceeded\n\nto pay his respects to his long friend. Mr.D. had abused him because he voted while inCongressin favor of theWilmot Proviso. Butafterthat wicked vote, this same gentleman, believing that he (Mr. L.) the only Whig from\n\nIllinois, had some influence withGen. Taylor, requested his influence to procure for him (Davis) a certainLand Office, and he got it! (Laughter.)7 One of Mr. D.’s arguments to prove the Republican a disunion party was, that they\n\nmade their flag with only thirteen stars on it! At the close of Mr. D.’s speech, Mr.\n\nL. took him to the corner of the State House and pointing to the Democratic flag (still\n\nflying there), requested him to count the stars. He did so, and lo there were just\n\nthirteen! (Old liner in the crowd— “That’s for the thirteen original States.”) Lincoln—\n\n“Then you don’tcareanything about thenew States. That leaves Illinois out of the Union!8 Mr. Davis admittted in his speech (in order to hedge against it) that he made the firstAnti-Nebraskaspeechprintedin Illinois—9and added, “if any of these litte men (Republicans) want a speech on the subject I will send them one of mine.” Mr.\n\nL. thought it must be averylittle man who could learn anything from that speech. (Laughter.) Having thus disposed\n\nof his friend “Long Jim,” in a manner so genial and mirthful that the victim himself,\n\nhad he been present, could not have taken umbrage at it, Mr. L. addressed himself\n\nto the general topics of the day. He adverted to the attempt to stigmatize the Republican\n\nparty as fanatical and disunion on account of the sentiments of particular supporters\n\nof thatparty, and showed, by quoting from the disunion speeches ofToombs,Slidell,WiseandBrooks, that this argument was a two-edged sword.10 A medical gentleman launched another democratic argument at the speaker by saying,\n\nas he shrugged his shoulders, “I must be a woolly head!”11L.— “Very well, shaveoffthe wool then.”12This repartee told with the more effect, as there was an unlucky twist in the doctor’s\n\nhair and whiskers, and was evidently enjoyed by the audience more than by himself. He demonstrated that the Republicans are walking in the “old paths”— read the recorded\n\nsentiments ofWashington,Jeffersonand others, and dwelt at length upon the position ofHenry Clay, (now quoted against him,) theNestorof the old Whig party. After quoting the declarations of these canonized leaders\n\nof both the great parties, he pointed to the doctor who had before interrupted him,\n\nand inquired, “What more than this has Fremont said, that you call him a woolly head? I ask you,\n\nsir?”13 The Doctor seemed suddenly to have lost the organs of speech. L.— “You can make this charge, and yet, when called upon to justify it, your lips aresealed.” One or two lawyers put their heads together with the Doctor’s. Mr. L. (smiling)—\n\n“That’s right, gentlemen, take counsel together, and give us your answer.”14Doctor (trying to look cheerful)— “He found the woolly horse and ate dogs.”15L.—Thataint true— but if it was, how does it prove that Fremont is awoolly head— how?” The Doctor, wearing the expression of a man standing on a bed of live coals, did\n\nnot get off any answer. Mr. L. (after a long pause)—You’retreed, my friend.” (Loud laughter.)16 Both the speakers were frequently interrupted by certainBuchananmen, whose zeal was without knowledge, and we are confident that all who adventured\n\nupon this undertaking went away with a lively recollection of the adage about handling\n\nedge tools.17Although much of the speaking was a hand-to-hand fight, owing to the discourtesy\n\nof certain opposers, yet the self-possession, wit, and unflagging good nature of the\n\nspeakers, made the discussiontellon the sober, honest men who listened. Mr.Peckwas then called forward, but being compelled to leave I did not hear his speech,\n\nthough I heard of it— as an uncommonly able one.18",

In 1848, Fremont had undertaken an expedition that involved crossing theRocky Mountains; his party encountered a devastating snowstorm that temporarily ceased all advancement.\n                  When Barnum heard the news that Fremont had been lost in the snowy mountains, but\n                  had survived, he grasped the story for his own purposes. Barnum, who had recently\n                  purchased a horse covered with “thick, fine hair or wool, which curled tight to his\n                  skin,” placed his new acquisition on display inNew Yorkand announced that it had been captured in the Rocky Mountains by Fremont’s party.During an earlier expedition to find a route across the Rocky Mountains, Fremont wrote\n                  in his journal, “I have already said that our provisions were very low; we had neither\n                  tallow nor grease of any kind remaining, and the want of salt became one of our greatest\n                  privations. The poor dog, which had been found in the Bear River Valley, and which\n                  had been acompagnon de voyageever since, had now become fat, and the mess to which it belonged requested permission\n                  to kill it. Leave was granted. Spread out on the snow, the meat looked very good.”John Bigelow,Memoir of the Life and Public Services of John Charles Fremont(New York: Derby & Jackson, 1856), 92-94, 100, 357, 367-68; P. T.
