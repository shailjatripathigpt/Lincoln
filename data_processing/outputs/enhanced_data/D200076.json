        "text": "2The letter “To the Editor of the Journal” from “Many Voters” reads, “I perceive the\n                  names of several persons in your paper as candidates to represent, or misrepresent,\n                  the people of Sangamon County in theLegislatureof this State. I think the times demand from them a declaration of their political\n                  doctrines at as early a period as possible.  Then the people will be better prepared\n                  to judge of their qualifications and fitness to serve them.  Surely no independent\n                  political man can object to this course, and political trimmers we have no use for\n                  in this latitude.”Lincoln was announcing his candidacy for re-election to theHouse of Representatives.  At the August 1, 1836 election for state representative, Lincoln received the highest\n                  number of votes of any candidate for Sangamon County. All seven representatives elected\n                  to represent Sangamon County were Whigs.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 11 June 1836, 2:5; Theodore C.

Van Buren carried Illinois with 18,459 votes (55%) to 15,240 (45%) for his combined\n                  challengers.    The Anti-Van Buren candidates carried New Salem, 64 to 34,Springfield, 719 to 376, and Sangamon County, 1463 to 903.  Roy P. Basler claims that White received\n                  all the anti-Van Buren votes, but it is clear from the Sangamo Journal that these\n                  totals were for the combined anti-Van Buren ticket.Theodore C.
