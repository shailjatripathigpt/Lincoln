        "text": "2Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. U.S. senators were chosen at this time by the Illinois General Assembly and\n                  Lincoln began quietly seeking the support of General Assembly members such as newly-elected\n                  representative forStark County, Thomas J. Henderson. The state’s voters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the Illinois\n                  General Assembly, in which Lincoln also won a seat. Around this date hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

Henderson\n                  voted for Lincoln through the first nine rounds of voting. For the tenth vote, Lincoln\n                  withdrew and urged his supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. Henderson cast\n                  his vote for Trumbull in the tenth and final round of voting in which the latter emerged\n                  victorious. See the1854 Federal Election.Victor B.
