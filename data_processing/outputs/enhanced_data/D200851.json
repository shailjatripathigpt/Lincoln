In 1849, Zebulon Parker\n                  sued Charles Hoyt in theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinoisfor violating Parker’s patent, obtained in October 1829, for a reaction percussion\n                  waterwheel. Hoyt retainedGrant Goodrich, Lincoln, andGeorge W. Meekerto argue his case. Parker retained Benjamin S. Edwards,Archibald Williams, andJohn R. Olney, Sr. The suit came to trial on July 9, 1850, and concluded on July 24. The jury found\n                  for Parker, and Hoyt requested a new trial. The court granted Hoyt’s motion. In the\n                  second trial, the jury found for Hoyt, and Parker motioned for a new trial. The court\n                  granted his motion. The case lingered on through the early 1850s. In November 1854,\n                  Hoyt wrote Lincoln two letters asking for word on his suit.In 1851, Lincoln wrote at least two letters toOrville H. BrowningandNehemiah Bushnelldiscussing the use of evidence from theParker v. Hoytcase in the three related cases in Rock Island County. As Lincoln notes in this letter\n                  to Hoyt, these three patent cases were also dismissed.Per legislation passed by theU.S. Congressin early 1855, the second term of the newly-created U.S. Circuit Court, Northern\n                  District of Illinois was scheduled to convene in Chicago on the third Monday in December\n                  1855, which fell on December 17.Grant Goodrich to Abraham Lincoln;The Lincoln Log, 9 July 1850,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1850-07-09; 24 July 1850,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1850-07-24; Newspaper Report, Document ID: 129692; Newspaper Report, Document ID: 132922; Newspaper\n                     Report, Document ID: 129693,Parker v.
