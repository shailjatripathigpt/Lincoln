        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senatein 1858. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches\n                  and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Ultimately, the Democrats retained control\n                  of the Illinois General Assembly and reelected DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, to the U.S. Senate.

        "text": "3The number of Catholics in the United States grew dramatically between 1830 and 1860,\n                  largely due to the influx of Catholic immigrants fromIreland,Germany, and other countries. The American South initially had more Catholic dioceses than\n                  the northern states. By 1850, however, Catholic dioceses in the North outnumbered\n                  their southern counterparts.J. F.

        "text": "4As Catholicism grew in the antebellum United States, so too did anti-Catholic sentiment.\n                  Anti foreign, anti-Catholic  nativism was the cultural response to the large influx\n                  of Catholic immigrants.  Nativist sentiments were commonplace among manyProtestantsin the 1850s, leading to the formation of theAmerican Partyas a political force.  Protestant and nativist propagandists sought to discredit\n                  Catholics by linking Catholicism with slavery--claiming both depended on blind adherence\n                  to authority and reverence for hierarchy.Whigsand Republicans often shared and espoused such bigotry.  Irish Catholics, often the\n                  subject of such condemnation, naturally gravitated as a result to the Democratic Party.Jay P. Dolan,In Search of an American Catholicism: A History of Religion and Culture in Tension, 56-58; Allen C.

        "text": "7Douglas’s criticism of President James Buchanan’s support for theLecompton Constitutioncaused a rift in the Democratic Party. Consequently, some Buchanan supporters opposed\n                  Douglas’s senatorial campaign. One group went so far as to hold a separate Democratic\n                  state convention which nominatedSidney Breesefor Senate. Knapp likely sought to exploit this split in the party.Douglas’s second wife,Adele, was a Catholic, and two of his sons were being educated at a Jesuit school inWashington, DC.  TheRepublican State Central Committeesought to exploit Douglas’s connection to Catholicism and the Democratic Party’s\n                  dependence on Irish Catholic votes to enhance Lincoln’s electoral chances.  Republican\n                  stump speakers raised the specter of a “Celtic invasion” of Illinois electoral districts,\n                  suggesting that Irish Americans building theIllinois Central Railroadwould commit voter fraud on Douglas’s behalf, to convince old Whigs to vote for Lincoln\n                  candidates to the General Assembly.  The Republicans also sought to divide Irish American\n                  and German Americans in hopes of getting votes  in the larger German American community.\n                  These tactics proved ineffective as Douglas was able to label Republicans as enemies\n                  of all immigrants and Catholics,  not just Irish American laborers.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:553-57; Allen C.
