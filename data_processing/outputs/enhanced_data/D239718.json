        "text": "3The vote Lincoln refers could well have been his vote in support ofGeorge Ashmun’s amendment to a resolution expressing thanks to GeneralZachary Taylorand his troops.  On January 3, 1848, RepresentativeJohn W. Houstonintroduced ajoint resolutionof thanks to General Taylor and his soldiers.  RepresentativeRobert C. Schenckmoved that the resolution be referred to the Committee on Military Affairs.  RepresentativeThomas J. Henleymoved to amend Schenck’s motion by adding the following: “with instructions to insert\n                  in the said resolution the following: 'engaged as they were, in defending the rights\n                  and honor of the country.’” Ashmun  proposed to amend these instructions by adding\n                  at the end the following: “in a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by\n                  the President of the United States.\"  The House adopted Ashmun’s amendment either\n                  by a vote of eighty-two yeas to eighty-one nays or eighty-five yeas to eighty-one\n                  nays, with Lincoln voting yea. (The HouseJournaland theCongressional Globediffer on the vote tabulation.)   There is no evidence that the House resumed consideration\n                  of this joint resolution or its amendments.  On February 7, 1848, the House passed\n                  ajoint resolutionof thanks to Taylor without Ashmun’s or Henley’s amendments by a vote of 181 yeas\n                  to one nay, with Lincoln voting yea.  The Senate adopted thejoint resolution with amendmentson February 16, and the House concurred in the Senate amendments on May 4.  PresidentJames K.
