        "text": "2The”difficulty” betweenLincolnandAndersonoccurred during the final, last hectic days of  thepresidential campaign of 1840.  Lincoln was canvassing the southern counties ofIllinoison behalf ofWilliam Henry Harrisonand theWhig Party. On October 28, Lincoln gave a speech atLawrenceville.  Anderson “repeatedly interrupted” Lincoln, contending that the orator was “falsifying\n                  the acts and record of theDemocratic party.” Lincoln’s retort was apparently testy enough to prompt Anderson to write a sharply-wordedletteron October 30.  Lincoln diffused the situation with this conciliatory letter. In\n                  1970, the Lawrence County Historical Society and the Illinois State Historical Society\n                  erected a marker  on the north side of courthouse square in Lawrenceville commemorating\n                  the Lincoln/Anderson dispute.Michael Burlingame, Abraham Lincoln: A Life (Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University\n                     Press, 2008), 1:158-59; Illinois State Historical Society, Historical Marker: Lincoln\n                     in Lawrenceville, accessed 7 July 2020,https://www.historyillinois.org/FindAMarker/MarkerDetails.aspx?MarkerID=144."
