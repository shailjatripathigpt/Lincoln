        "text": "2Lincoln’s August 9 letter to Parks has not been located. However, in an August 9lettertoDaniel A. Cheever, Lincoln noted that he would try to send Parks to speak in Tremont, Illinois in his\n                  stead, as he already had a speaking appointment in Havanna, Illinois on August 14—the\n                  date that Cheever wanted him to speak in Tremont.At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running againstDemocraticincumbent Stephen A. Douglas as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. During the summer and fall of 1858, he  crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches\n                  and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates. At the time, theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of the races\n                  for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewas highly relevant to the1858 Federal Election.

        "text": "3Tremont is inTazewell County, Illinois, which, at the time, was part of Illinois’ Seventeenth Senate District, along withMenard,Logan,Mason, andCasscounties. Logan and Cass counties both held their Republican conventions in June\n                  1858, and  delegates to those conventions did not nominate a Republican candidate\n                  for the Illinois Senate to run against Democrat Samuel W. Fuller, the incumbent who\n                  held over in the 1858 election.Lincoln delivered a political speech in Havana on August 14. During the election campaign\n                  of 1858, Lyman Trumbull campaigned throughout Illinois in support of Lincoln and the\n                  Republican Party, but there is no direct evidence that Trumbull and Lincoln met between\n                  the time of this letter and Lincoln’s address in Havana.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 219, 221;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 14 June 1858, 2:3; 15 June 1858, 2:3; 3 November 1858, 2:2;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 November 1858, 2:4;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 14 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-14;Report of Speech at Havana, Illinois; Ralph J.

        "text": "5If Lincoln replied to this letter his response has not been located. It is unclear\n                  if William H. Herndon delivered a speech in Lincoln, Illinois. Since he and Lincoln\n                  were law partners, Lincoln would most likely have passed on Parks’ request to Herndon\n                  in person.Although there is no evidence that Parks delivered an address in Tremont on August\n                  14, Parks campaigned for Lincoln and the Republican cause in several different locations\n                  during the 1858 election.Lincoln did not speak in Lincoln, Illinois,  on August 29, as Parks requested. He\n                  was inPekin, Illinoisthat day, en route to Tremont, where he delivered an address on August 30. Lincoln\n                  eventually delivered an address in Lincoln on October 16. Parks introduced him to\n                  the audience on that occasion.Douglas had delivered a public address in Lincoln in July. He returned to Lincoln\n                  and spoke again September 4. Lincoln was present for the latter address, but did not\n                  offer a rejoinder.Coverage of the Republican conventions for  Tazewell, Menard, and Mason counties,\n                  which were held  in September 1858, does not mention any Republican nominee or nominees\n                  for the Seventeenth Senate District’s seat in the Illinois Senate. Fuller remained\n                  in the Illinois Senate and, when the time came, cast his ballot for Douglas for U.S.\n                  senator.Although Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois in the local elections\n                  of 1858, pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however, and\n                  in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained\n                  recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 29 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-29, 30 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-30, 4 September 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-04;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;Summary of Speech at Tremont, Illinois;Summary of Speech at Tremont, Illinois;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 21 July 1858, 2:1; 4 September 1858, 2:1-3, 3:1; 7 September 1858,\n                     2:2-3; 17 September 1858, 2:2, 3; 18 October 1858, 2:3;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 20 October 1858, 2:6;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 November 1858, 2:4; Illinois SenateJournal. 1859. 21st G.
