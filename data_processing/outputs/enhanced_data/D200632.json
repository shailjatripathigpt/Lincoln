The entire text of Linder’s remarks is not extant, but excerpts indicate that Linder\n                  criticized Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing for his patronage appointments,\n                  particularly the selection of Justin H. Butterfield as commissioner of the U.S. General\n                  Land Office.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair. On November 8, theDaily Register,  theDemocraticpaper in Springfield, published an excerpt of Linder’s speech with editorial comment,\n                  and on November 14, theChicago Daily Journalresponded with its own excerpt and commentary.

D. MorrisonandCyrus Edwards, the other competitors for the job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. Even while Lincoln’s friends pressed him to compete against Butterfield for the\n                  appointment, and even as he asserted that Butterfield had weak claims to the position,\n                  Lincoln reminded his friends that Butterfield was “qualified to do the duties of the\n                  office.” After Butterfield received the appointment, Lincoln encouraged his “good\n                  friends every where” to approve Butterfield’s appointment, or, at the very least,\n                  “be silent when they can not.”Abraham Lincoln to Josiah M.

Many Midwestern Whigs believed Ewing wielded too much power with\n                  regard to patronage appointments, and vigorously protested his use of power.Michael F.
