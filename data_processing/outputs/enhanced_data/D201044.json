        "text": "2Both Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, and the editors searched thePrairie Beacon, without success, for the article that Lincoln notes he enclosed with this letter.\n                  Some of the context for this letter is therefore missing. Robert Moseley’s June 29letterto Lincoln focused onDemocraticinsinuations that theRepublican Partywas composed of radicalabolitionistsbent on emancipation by \"stealing\" and subsequently freeing enslaved persons, and\n                  that Lincoln, as the Republican candidate forStephen A. Douglas’ seat in theU.S. Senate, supported the same. It is possible that the article Lincoln wished Moseley to publish\n                  was related to these insinuations.In local elections for theIllinois General Assembly, which elected U.S. senators in 1858,Edgar County’s voters sent Moseley to theIllinois House of RepresentativesandThomas A. Marshall, another Republican, to theIllinois Senate.Democratsretained a majority in both chambers, however, allowing Douglas to win reelection\n                  to the U.S. Senate in the1858 Federal Election. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.Robert Moseley to Abraham Lincoln;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 November 1858, 2:4; Roy P.
