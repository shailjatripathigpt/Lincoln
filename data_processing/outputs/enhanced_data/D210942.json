Geer wrote Lincoln\n                  at least two other letters related to theelection campaign of 1858prior to this letter.At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace incumbentDemocratStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senate. Lincoln delivered a campaign address in Pekin, Illinois, on October 5. Lyman Trumbull\n                  was not present. On October 6, Lincoln traveled from Peoria, Illinois, to Galesburg,\n                  Illinois, where he was scheduled to debate Douglas the next day.Lincoln had agreed to Douglas’ proposal for the schedule for theLincoln-Douglas Debateson July 31. Newspapers in Illinois published the debate schedule at least as early\n                  as August 6. By that time, it is likely that Lincoln had little flexibility in his\n                  travel and speaking schedule in the dates closest to his debate appointments.Newspapers published in early September showed that Trumbull was scheduled to deliver\n                  speeches in Lacon, Illinois, on October 5 and in Peoria on October 7. By late September,\n                  however,  a newspaper in Peoria noted that his speaking engagement in that town had\n                  been changed to October 6.In the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas ultimately won reelection. Through\n                  the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas\n                  Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican\n                  Party.Nathan C.
