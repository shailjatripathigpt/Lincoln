Thompson and Elisha Embree wrote in support of his qualifications\n                  for the position of commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. In June 1849, PresidentZachary Taylorawarded Butterfield the appointment. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Immediately following Butterfield’s appointment, LincolnwroteEwing and requested that all letters of recommendation and reference filed with theU.S. Department of the Interiorpertaining to his candidacy for the position be returned to him. Ewing complied,\n                  returning all but three of the letters from Lincoln’s file. Lincoln requested an explanation\n                  for the missing letters, expressing particular concern over Thompson’s and Embree’s\n                  letters. Ewing responded in his July 18, 1849letterto Lincoln.Thompson’s and Embree’s letters of recommendation have not been located.Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing."

        "text": "5Ewing’s reply, if he wrote one, has not been located. Lincoln suspected that  Thompson's\n                  and Embree’s letters were purposefully omitted by someone at the Department of the\n                  Interior in order to give Butterfield an advantage over him in the competition for\n                  the job. However,  he laterwroteJohn Addisonthat his loyalty to both Taylor and “the greatwhigcause” induced him to remain silent about his suspicions.Eventually, on April 22, 1850, theDemocrat-controlledU.S. House of Representativesformed a committee underWilliam A. Richardsonto investigate Ewing’s role in and handling of patronage appointments as well as\n                  his management of pension payments and Department of the Interior accounts. On June\n                  8, 1850, theNew York Heraldreported that Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office was one patronage appointment that the Richardson Committee was investigating,\n                  particularly with regard to letters missing from the file on Lincoln that was shown\n                  to President Taylor prior to Taylor selecting the final appointee. However, when the\n                  Committee filed its final reports on September 4-7, 1850, it made no finding regarding\n                  Butterfield’s appointment. The Whig-controlledU.S. Senatealso exonerated Ewing of all charges, although suspicions remained in some Whig circles\n                  that Ewing had indeed suppressed letters of recommendation from Lincoln’s  file.Cong.
