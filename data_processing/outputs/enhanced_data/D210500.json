Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere among the early contestants. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.In early June, Lincoln asked supporters of his candidacy to send him letters to that\n                  effect.  Presumably, he made the same request of Boal. Ultimately, neither Morrison,\n                  Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job went to Butterfield instead.\n                  See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B.
