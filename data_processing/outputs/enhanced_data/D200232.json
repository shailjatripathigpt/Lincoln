    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on “A Bill Providing for the Payment of Interest on\n\nthe State Debt,” 4 December 18401 Mr.Lincolnsaid he submitted thispropositionwith great diffidence. He had felt his share of the responsibility devolving upon\n\nus in the present crisis, and after revolving in his mind every scheme which seemed\n\nto afford the least prospect of relief, he submitted this as the result of his own\n\ndeliberations. The details of the bill might be imperfect, but he relied upon the\n\ncorrectness of its general features. By the plan proposed in theoriginal bill, of hypothecating our bonds, he was satisfied we could not get along more than two\n\nor three months before some other step would be necessary—another session would have\n\nto be called, and new provisions made. It might be objected that these bonds would not be saleable, and the money could not\n\nbe raised in time. He was no financier, but he believed these bonds thus secured,\n\nwould be equal to the best in market. A perfect security was provided for the interest,\n\nand it was this characteristic that inspired confidence and made bonds saleable.\n\nIf there was any distrust, it could not be because enough had not been promised; it\n\nmust be because our means of fulfilling our promises were distrusted. He believed\n\nit would have the effect to raise our other bonds in market. There was another objection\n\nto this plan, which applied to the original bill, and that was as to impropriety of\n\nborrowing money to pay interest on borrowed money—that we are hereby paying compound\n\ninterest. To this he would reply, that if it were a fact that our population and\n\nwealth were increasing in a ratio greater than the increased interest hereby incurred,\n\nthen this wus not a good objection. If our increasing means would justify us in deferring\n\nto a future time the resort to taxation, then we had better pay compound interest,\n\nthan resort to taxation now. He was satisfied that, by a direct tax now, money enough\n\ncould not be collected to pay our accruing interest. The bill proposed to provide\n\nin this way for interest not otherwise provided for. It was not intended to apply\n\nto those bonds, for the interest on which, a security had already been provided.\n\nHe hoped theHousewould seriously consider the proposition. He had no pride in its success, as a measure\n\nof his own, but submitted it to the wisdom of the House, with the hope, that if there\n\nwas any thing objectionable in it, it would be pointed out and amended. Mr.Murphy, ofCook, remarked that he was struck with the propriety of the measure of the gentleman fromSangamon, (Mr. Lincoln) as a permanent measure, with some modifications.—But he believed it\n\nwould not answer the present emergency—the money could not hereby be raised soon enough.\n\nHe thought, too, the measure, without further perfection, would not be adequate to\n\nmeet accruing interest unprovided for. By reference to theGovernor’smessage, it would be found, that during the present and next year, the amount of land becoming\n\ntaxable, would exceed five millions of acres. The tax upon this, it was proposed, should be pledged to the payment of these interest\n\nbonds—this would secure the interest on these bonds.—But if it was intended to rely\n\nupon this, together with the additional 10 per cent. that was to be collected for\n\nthe State Treasury, as a permanent means of meeting the interest on our present debt,\n\nit was inadequate. The sum, he had found by calculation, would amount to about 122,000\n\ndollars; whilst the Fund commissioner had just informed us that our semi-annual interest\n\nwas 175,000. With the outlines of the bill, however, he was pleased, and thought,\n\nwith modification, it would be well to adopt such a plan as a permanent source of\n\npaying our interest. In the mean time, however, we must provide for the present exigency. Mr.Kitchellmoved to strike out the amendment and insert a resolution providing for a sale of\n\nall our railroad property, iron, &c. and appropriating the proceeds to the payment of the liabilities of theState, so far as they would go. Mr.Kitchellsaid it had been said he had no plan. He now came forward with his plan. He desired\n\nthe State to act with its proporty as a prudent individual would act. It was going to decay, rotting and rusting, and\n\nshould be immediately disposed of. When we had done this—sold all our property and\n\napplied it to our debts, we had done all that could be No nation would consider us disgraced if we did the best we could to pay our debts. Mr.Peckthought there was too much honor and moral honesty in the House for it to entertain\n\nfor a moment the project of the gentleman (Mr. Kitchell) fromMontgomery. The gentleman had taken an occasion, the other day, to read him a lecture for his\n\nattachment to foreign widows. He was not surprised that the gentleman attributed\n\nhis zeal for the preservation of the faith of the State to a passion for widows; for\n\nhe seemed incapable of appreciating a higher motive. What is the gentleman’s proposition?\n\nTo sell old houses, ditches, and decaying timber, to pay our past debts, and if that\n\ndoes not pay them, they may go unpaid. Was this honest? Would it be honesty in a\n\nprivate individual thus to act, if he had other means of paying his debts? The gentleman\n\ncould not understand the difference between private and public credit. He could inform\n\nhim there was a great difference. If an individual owes a debt, and does not pay\n\nit to the very day, yet if he is strenuous in his efforts to pay it and does it as\n\nsoon as possible, his credit is maintained. But it was very different with the reputation\n\nof a State—the “winds of Heaven should not visit it too roughly.”2The failure of a day, was of incalculable loss to the credit of a State. Look what\n\nimpolitic legislation last winter had done for us. Through intolerant party zeal,\n\na report was adopted by the Legislature, which produced the impression abroad, that\n\nthe State intended to disannul her contracts, and our securities had suffered in the\n\nmarket ever since. To prove this, he would cite the fact thatMichiganbonds of the same character of ours, issued at the same time, were selling for 86\n\nper cent. whilst but 81 could be obtained for ours. This showed how sensitive public\n\nfeeling was upon this subject. Thegentlemanfrom Montgomery seemed much concerned for his constituents. He would tell that gentleman\n\nthat if his constituents were not in favor of our paying our just debts promptly,\n\nthey did not understand their moral obligations—they were not morally honest. As to the proposition of thegentlemanfrom Sangamon, though there was much sagacity in its conception, yet he was afraid\n\nthat it would not prove sufficient for the present crisis. He feared there was no\n\nprobability of these bonds bringing more than our others. He preferred the first\n\nbill, because there was danger of our mooting this subject, until our action would\n\nbe too late. Upon the speedy passage of some such bill were suspended the honor,\n\ncredit, and character of the State. Mr.Lincolnreplied at considerable length, and repeated his former arguments in favor of the\n\namendment offered by himself. In conclusion, Mr. L. said that his plan had been termed\n\nan expedient. He considered this an unfortunate expression for those who advocated\n\nthe original bill. That emphatically an expedient—a mere shift, which could but answer\n\na temporary purpose, and might lead to further difficulty. Mr.Gridlyapproved of the plan proposed by thegentlemanfrom Sangamon. Those who held our bonds, were most interested in preserving the\n\ncredit of the State—if that went down, they were to be the sufferers. This being\n\nthe case, was it not highly probable that the holders of bonds would come forward\n\nand accept these Interest Bonds in payment of interest? Secured, as they were, they\n\nwould certainly be equal to the best in market, and have a beneficial effect upon\n\nour other bonds. Mr.Kitchellremarked that thegentlemanfrom Cook (Mr. Peck) had endeavored to draw him into a personal controversy, in which\n\nhe could not succeed. He had alluded to a remark about “foreign widows,” which he\n\nhad made the other day, and forgotten; but which seemed to trouble the gentleman yet.\n\nThe gentleman had very modestly assumed all the sense of the House, and had remarked\n\nthat no man of sense would support this resolution. He thought there were as sensible\n\nmen in the House as thegentlemanfrom Cook, after all his bragging and blustering about sense. Thegentlemanfrom Sangamon was a man of better sense—at least he had submitted a wiser plan to\n\nthe House. The bill advocated by thegentlemanfrom Cook, was the most foolish thing he ever heard of. Mr.Munsellsaid his constituents gave him credit for managing his own business correctly, and\n\nas a general rule, it would be found that the principles correct in private business,\n\nwould be so when applied to our State affairs. He was tired of expedients. For the\n\nlast two or three years our monetary affairs had been going down. It was high time\n\nwe were casting about us to see where we were. He was for paying our January interest\n\nand preserving our credit if we could; but if he could not see a clear sky beyond—if\n\nthere was not some stable provision for the future, he confessed that he could see\n\nno good that would arise from punctuality then. If some measure was not devised,\n\nour credit must eventually go down, and if such is to be the case, it had as well\n\ngo first as last. He held in his hand a proposition which he intended as an amendment,\n\nat a proper time, to the one reported from the Finance committee, by which it was\n\nproposed to lay a tax of one-fifth of one per cent. on all taxable property, which\n\nshould be pledged for the payment of interest on our bonds. He had had nothing to\n\ndo in bringing this debt upon the country. It was in consequence of our ruinous Rail-road\n\nprojects which he had always opposed; but he thought it his bounden duty to assist\n\nin doing the best we could for the country. Mr.Cavarlythought the prominent features of both plans suggested, might be incorporated into\n\none bill, and objections to each might thus be avoided. He would suggest whether\n\nby hypothecating these Interest Bonds, the objection of their not raising the money\n\nsoon enough, would not be obviated? It had been objected that the name of Interest\n\nBonds would be prejudicial to them. He thought this would make no difference—their\n\nobject was the same with our other bonds—to raise money. The question on Mr. Kitchell’s resolution was taken and lost. Mr.Hardinmoved that the committee rise, report progress and ask leave to sit again; agreed\n\nto. The House discharged the committee of the whole, and on motion, the bill and amendments\n\nwere re-committed to the committee on Finance.",

The gentleman had taken an occasion, the other day, to read him a lecture for his\n               attachment to foreign widows.  He was not surprised that the gentleman attributed\n               his zeal for the preservation of the faith of the State to a passion for widows; for\n               he seemed incapable of appreciating a higher motive.  What is the gentleman’s proposition?\n               To sell old houses, ditches, and decaying timber, to pay our past debts, and if that\n               does not pay them, they may go unpaid.  Was this honest? Would it be honesty in a\n               private individual thus to act, if he had other means of paying his debts? The gentleman\n               could not understand the difference between private and public credit.  He could inform\n               him there was a great difference.  If an individual owes a debt, and does not pay\n               it to the very day, yet if he is strenuous in his efforts to pay it and does it as\n               soon as possible, his credit is maintained.  But it was very different with the reputation\n               of a State—the “winds of Heaven should not visit it too roughly.”2The failure of a day, was of incalculable loss to the credit of a State.  Look what\n               impolitic legislation last winter had done for us.  Through intolerant party zeal,\n               a report was adopted by the Legislature, which produced the impression abroad, that\n               the State intended to disannul her contracts, and our securities had suffered in the\n               market ever since.  To prove this, he would cite the fact thatMichiganbonds of the same character of ours, issued at the same time, were selling for 86\n               per cent. whilst but 81 could be obtained for ours. This showed how sensitive public\n               feeling was upon this subject.  Thegentlemanfrom Montgomery seemed much concerned for his constituents.  He would tell that gentleman\n               that if his constituents were not in favor of our paying our just debts promptly,\n               they did not understand their moral obligations—they were not morally honest."
