Mr. Woodson in the chair. The resolution of theSenatewas then read fixing the ratio at 12,000 souls for a Senator, and 5,000 for a representative.2 Mr.MURPHYmoved to strike out 12,000 and insert 10,000. Mr.Bealmoved to insert 15,000. Mr.MurphyofCookthen moved only to strike out 12. Mr.HARDINspoke against the principle to making the number of Senator’s too large; he would\n\noppose the striking out and adhere to the proportion fixed in Senate. Mr.BENTLEYagreed with Mr.H. there were already too many here.3 Mr.WEBBwas in favor of striking out, and having a lesser ratio for the Senate. If it was\n\nincreased in number, it did not follow that the House must be equally increased. The question on striking out was then taken and the House refused to strike out. The quesion being on the adoption of the resolution, Mr.Carpentermoved to strike ou5,000, the proposed ratio for a representative, as otherwise some counties not having\n\nthat population would have no Representative at all. Mr.C. contended that each county ought to have a representative. He therefore, wished\n\na less number to be inserted for that ratio. The people would never complain of the\n\nexpense of being represented. Mr.PARSONSwas in favor of a lesser ratio, nearly 50 counties did not come up to 5,000 in population. Mr.LINCOLNlaid down the principle that we should be represented in proportion to the number\n\nof population, not according to county divisions: the contrary doctrine was anti-republican.\n\nA county ought not to have a representative merely because it is a county, and without\n\nregard to its inhabitants. Mr.L. confessed the question was involved in difficulty: at present, however, he was inclined\n\nto adhere to the ratio proposed by the Senate. Mr. CARPENTER explained. Mr.WHITEwas of the opinion that a Representative in this House represented the people, and\n\nnot particular counties. It did not appear to him practicable to fix the ratio by\n\ncounties. He was in favor of the number in the resolution. Mr.LOGANwas against that number he went for each county having a representative: he wished\n\nno county to have more than two representatives and each county at least to have one. Mr.DODGEbelieved each county had a right to be heard upon this floor: he thought the ratio\n\ntoo high, and that many counties would not be represented. He would fix the ratio\n\nat 3000: the people would more cheerfully pay the tax for representatives, than any\n\nother tax. Mr.DOLLINSwas in favor of striking out and inserting a less ratio: else, 50 counties at least\n\nwould have no representative. He replied to the position assumed bymr. Lincoln, when On motion ofmr.EWINGthe committee rose reported progress and asked leave to sit again, which was granted. On motion ofmr. LOGAN, the House adjourned.4",

On January 13, the House struck out 5,000 as the\n                  basis for representation in the House and inserted in lieu thereof 4,500.  The House\n                  further reduced the number to 4,000 by a vote of 47 yeas to 37 nays, with Lincoln\n                  not voting.  The House adopted the Senate resolution as amended by a vote of 47 yeas\n                  to 36 nays, with Lincoln not voting.  On January 14, the Senate rejected the House\n                  amendment by a vote of 12 yeas to 23 nays.  On January 25, the House refused to recede\n                  from its amendment by a vote of 32 yeas to 54 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The\n                  Senate and House created a committee of conference to resolve the disagreeing vote.\n                  On January 28, the conference committee reported back the Senate resolution as amended,\n                  recommending that the Senate adopt the House amendment, and the Senate concurred.\n                  The Senate resolution as amended became the basis for the ratio of representation\n                  found in section one of an apportionmentbillthat becamelawon February 26.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G.
