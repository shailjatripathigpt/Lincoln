        "text": "2The previous apportionment legislation had been passed in 1836. Since that time, county\n                  boundaries in Illinois had undergone considerable changes, with new counties being\n                  carved out of many of the older, geographically larger counties. Of the seven counties\n                  mentioned in this letter, three (Jersey, Cass, and Scott) had been created since the\n                  previous apportionment legislation. Will County had been carved out of Cook County\n                  days before the1836 lawwas passed, and so the law contained no provisions for Will County’s representation.\n                  One county—Greene—was significantly smaller because Jersey County had been carved\n                  out of it. The apportionment passed by theGeneral Assemblyin 1841 accounted for all those changes, in addition to the fact that Illinois’ population\n                  center was moving gradually northward. However, the law contained no provision to\n                  account for mid-term senators whose districts were to be superseded by the 1841 law.\n                  This ambiguity caused at least four cases of double representation in the 13th General\n                  Assembly, all of which were corrected by a member resigning his seat or by the Senate\n                  refusing to seat one of the duplicate representatives.An Act to Apportion the Representation of the Several Counties in This State;An Act to Apportion the Representation of the Several Counties in this State; Theodore Calvin Pease,The Frontier State, 1818-1848, vol. 2 ofThe Sesquicentennial History of Illinois(Springfield: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1918), 173-174;An Act to Establish the County of Will;An Act for the Formation of Lake County;An Act to Create the County of DuPage;An Act for the Formation of the County of Cass;An Act to Create and Organize the County of Scott;An Act to Create and Establish the County of Jersey; Theodore C.
