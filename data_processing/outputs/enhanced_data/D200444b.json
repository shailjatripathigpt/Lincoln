WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 14, 1848. WASHINGTON: J. & G. S. GIDEON, PRINTERS. SPEECH. The House being in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to the consideration of theAnnual Messageof the President of the United States, and the resolutions referring the same to\n\nvarious appropriate Committees. MR. LINCOLN, of Illinois, addressed the Committee as follows: Mr.Chairman: Some, if not all, the gentlemen on the other side of the House,2who have addressed the committee within the last two days, have spoken rather complainingly,\n\nif I have rightly understood them, of the vote given a week or ten days ago, declaring\n\nthat thewar with Mexicowas unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President.3I admit that such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness, and that\n\nthe one given is justly censurable, if it have no other or better foundation. I am\n\none of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under my best impression of thetruthof the case. How I got this impression, and how it may possibly be removed, I will\n\nnow try to show. When the war began, it was my opinion that all those who, because\n\nof knowing toolittle, or because of knowing toomuch, could not conscientiously approve the conduct of the President—in the beginning\n\nof it, should, nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on that\n\npoint, at least till the war should be ended. Some leadingdemocrats, including ExPresident Van Buren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered to it, and acted\n\nupon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think I should still adhere to it,\n\nwere it not that the President and his friends will not allow it to be so. Besides,\n\nthe continual effort of the President to argue every silent vote given for supplies\n\ninto an endorsement of the justice and wisdom of his conduct, besides that singularly\n\ncandid paragraph in his latemessage, in which he tells us thatCongress, with great unanimity, only two in theSenateand fourteen in the House dissenting, had declared that “by the act of the Republic ofMexicoa state of war exists between that Government and the United States;” when the same journals that informed him of this, also informed him that, when\n\nthat declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies, sixty-seven in\n\nthe House, and not fourteen, merely, voted against it;4besides this open attempt to prove, by telling thetruth, what he could not prove by telling thewhole truth, demanding of all who will not submit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves,\n\nto speak out; besides all this, one of my colleagues, (Mr.Richardson,) at a very early day in the session, brought in a set of resolutions, expressly\n\nendorsing the<Page 4>original justice of the war on the part of the President.5Upon these resolutions, when they shall be put on their passage, I shall becompelledto vote; so that I cannot be silent if I would. Seeing this, I went about preparing\n\nmyself to give the vote understandingly, when it should come. I carefully examined\n\nthe President’s messages, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the\n\npoint. The result of this examination was to make the impression, that taking for\n\ntrue all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his justification;\n\nand that the President would have gone farther with his proof, if it had not been\n\nfor the small matter, that thetruthwould not permit him. Under the impression thus made, I gave the vote before mentioned.\n\nI propose now to give, concisely, the process of the examination I made, and how I\n\nreached the conclusion I did. The President, in his first message of May, 1846, declares\n\nthat the soil wasourson which hostilities were commenced by Mexico; and he repeats that declaration, almost\n\nin the same language, in each successive annual message; thus showing that he esteems\n\nthat point a highly essential one.6In the importance of that point, I entirely agree with the President. To my judgment,\n\nit is thevery pointupon which he should be justified or condemned. In his message of December, 1846,\n\nit seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly true, that title, ownership to soil,\n\nor any thing else, is not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following one or more\n\nsimple facts; and, that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which\n\nhe concluded the soil was ours, on which the first blood of the war was shed. Accordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve, in the message last referred\n\nto, he enters upon that task, forming an issue and introducing testimony, extending\n\nthe whole to a little below the middle of page fourteen. Now, I propose to try to\n\nshow that the whole of this—issue and evidence—is, from beginning to end, the sheerest\n\ndeception. The issue, as he presents it, is in these words: “But there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the ground that the\n\ntrue western boundary ofTexasis theNueces, instead of theRio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching our army to the east bank of the latter river,\n\nwe passed the Texan line, and invaded the territory of Mexico.”7Now this issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative. The main deception\n\nof it is, that it assumes as true thatoneriver or theotheris necessarily the boundary, and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the\n\nidea, thatpossiblythe boundary is somewherebetweenthe two, and not actually at either. A further deception is, that it will let inevidencewhich a true issue would exclude. A true issue, made by the President, would be\n\nabout as follows: “I say the soilwas ourson which the first blood was shed; there are those who say it was not.” I now proceed to examine the President’s evidence, as applicable to such an issue.\n\nWhen that evidence is analyzed, it is all included in the following propositions: 1. That the Rio Grande was the western boundary ofLouisiana, as wepurchasedit ofFrancein 1803. 2. That the republic of Texas alwaysclaimedthe Rio Grande as her western boundary. 3. That, by various acts, she had claimed iton paper. 4. ThatSanta Anna, in his treaty with Texas, recognised the Rio Grande as her boundary. 5. That Texasbefore, and the United Statesafterannexation, hadexercisedjurisdictionbeyondthe Nueces,betweenthe two rivers. 6. That our Congressunderstoodthe boundary of Texas to extend beyond the Nueces. Now for each of these in its turn: His first item is, that the Rio Grande was the western boundary of Louisiana, as we\n\npurchased it of France in 1803; and, seeming to expect this to be disputed, he argues\n\nover the amount of nearly a page to prove it true; at the end of which he lets us\n\nknow that, by thetreaty of 1819, we sold toSpainthe whole country, from the Rio Grande eastward to theSabine. Now, admitting, for the present, that the Rio Grande was the boundary of Louisiana,\n\nwhat, under Heaven, had that to do with thepresentboundary between us and Mexico? How, Mr. Chairman, the line that once divided your\n\nland from mine canstillbe the boundary between usafterI have sold my land to you, is, to me, beyond all comprehension. And how any man,\n\nwith an honest purpose only of proving the truth, could ever havethoughtof introducing such a fact to prove such an issue, is equally incomprehensible. The\n\noutrage upon commonright, of seizing as our own what we have once sold, merely because itwasoursbeforewe sold it, is only equalled by the outrage on commonsenseof any attempt to justify it. His next piece of evidence is, that “the republic of Texas alwaysclaimedthis river (Rio Grande) as her western boundary.”8That is not true, in fact. Texashasclaimed it, but she has notalwaysclaimed it. There is, at least, one distinguished exception. Her State constitution,\n\nthe republic’s most solemn and well considered act, that which may, without impropriety,\n\nbe called her last will and testament, revoking all others, makes no such claim.9But suppose she had always claimed it. Has not Mexico always claimed the contrary?\n\nSo that there is butclaimagainstclaim, leaving nothing proved until we get back of the claims, and find which has the betterfoundation. Though not in the order in which the President presents his evidence, I<Page 6>now consider that class of his statements which are, in substance, nothing more than\n\nthat Texas has, by various acts of her convention and congress, claimed the Rio Grande\n\nas her boundary,on paper. I mean, here, what he says about the fixing of the Rio Grande as her boundary in\n\nher old constitution (not her State constitution) about forming congressional districts,\n\ncounties, &c.10Now all of this is but nakedclaim;and what I have already said about claims is strictly applicable to this. If I should\n\nclaim your land by word of mouth, that certainly would not make it mine; and if I\n\nwere to claim it by a deed which I had made myself, and with which you had had nothing\n\nto do, the claim would be quite the same in substance, or rather in utter nothingness. I next consider the President’s statement that Santa Anna, in histreatywith Texas, recognised the Rio Grande as the western boundary of Texas. Besides, the position so often\n\ntaken that Santa Anna, while a prisoner of war—a captive—couldnot bind Mexico by a treaty, which I deem conclusive; besides this, I wish to say\n\nsomething in relation to this treaty, so called by the President, with Santa Anna.\n\nIf any man would like to be amused by a sight of thatlittlething, which the President calls by thatbigname, he can have it by turning toNiles’ Register, volume 50, page 336. And if any one should suppose thatNiles’ Registeris a curious repository of so mighty a document as a solemn treaty between nations,\n\nI can only say that I learned, to a tolerable degree of certainty, by inquiry at the\n\nState Department, that the President himself never saw it any where else. By the\n\nway, I believe I should not err if I were to declare that, during the first ten years\n\nof the existence of that document, it was never, by any body,calleda treaty; that it was never so called till the President, in his extremity, attempted,\n\nby so calling it, to wring something from it in justification of himself in connexion with the Mexican war. It has none of the distinguishing features of a treaty. It\n\ndoes not call itself a treaty. Santa Anna does not therein assume to bind Mexico;\n\nhe assumes only to act as the president, commander-in-chief of the Mexican army and\n\nnavy; stipulates that the then present hostilities should cease, and that he would\n\nnothimselftake up arms, norinfluencethe Mexican people to take up arms, against Texas during the existence of the war\n\nof independence. He did not recognise the independence of Texas; he did not assume to put an end to the war, but clearly\n\nindicated his expectation of its continuance; he did not say one word about boundary,\n\nand most probably never thought of it. Itisstipulated therein that the Mexican forces should evacuate the territory of Texas,passing to the other side of the Rio Grande;and in another article it is stipulated that, to prevent collisions between the armies,\n\nthe Texan army should not approach<Page 7>nearer than within five leagues—ofwhatis not said—but clearly, from the object stated, it is of the Rio Grande. Now, if\n\nthis is a treaty recognising the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the singular feature of stipulating\n\nthat Texas shall not go within five leagues ofher ownboundary.11 Next comes the evidence of Texas before annexation, and the United States afterwards,exercisingjurisdictionbeyondthe Nueces, andbetweenthe two rivers. This actualexerciseof jurisdiction is the very class or quality of evidence we want. It is excellent\n\nso far as it goes, but does it go far enough? He tells us it wentbeyondthe Nueces, but he does not tell us it wenttothe Rio Grande. He tells us jurisdiction was exercisedbetweenthe two rivers, but he does not tell us it was exercised overallthe territory between them. Some simple minded people think it ispossibleto cross one river and gobeyondit, without goingall the wayto the next; that jurisdiction may be exercisedbetweentwo rivers without coveringallthe country between them. I know a man, not very unlike myself, who exercises jurisdiction\n\nover a piece of land between theWabashand theMississippi; and yet so far is this from beingallthere is between those rivers, that it is just one hundred and fifty-two feet long\n\nby fifty wide, and no part of it much within a hundred miles of either. He has a neighbor\n\nbetween him and the Mississippi—that is, just across the street, in that direction—whom,\n\nI am sure, he could neitherpersuadenorforceto give up his habitation; but which, nevertheless, he could certainly annex, if\n\nit were to be done, by merely standing on his own side of the street andclaimingit, or even sitting down and writing adeedfor it. But next, the President tells us, the Congress of the United Statesunderstoodthe State of Texas they admitted into the Union to extendbeyondthe Nueces. Well, I suppose they did—Icertainly so understand it—but howfarbeyond? The Congress didnotunderstand it to extend clear to the Rio Grande, is quite certain by the fact of\n\ntheir joint resolutions for admission expressly leaving all questions of boundary\n\nto future adjustment. And it may be added, that Texas herself is proved to have had\n\nthe same understanding of it that our Congress had, by the fact of the exact conformity\n\nof her new constitution to those resolutions.12 I am now through the whole of the President’s evidence; and it is a singular fact,\n\nthat if any one should declare the President sent the army into the midst of a settlement\n\nof Mexican people, who had never submitted, by consent or by force, to the authority\n\nof Texas or of the United States, and thatthere, andthereby, the first blood of the war was shed, there is not one word in all the President\n\nhas said which would either admit or deny the declaration. In this strange omission\n\nchiefly consists the deception<Page 8>of the President’s evidence; an omission which, it does seem to me, could scarcely\n\nhave occurred but by design. My way of living leads me to be about the courts of justice;\n\nand there I have sometimes seen a good lawyer, struggling for his client’s neck, in\n\na desperate case, employing every artifice to work round, befog, and cover up with\n\nmany words, some position pressed upon him by the prosecution, which hedarednot admit, and yetcouldnot deny. Party bias may help to make it appear so; but, with all the allowance I\n\ncan make for such bias, it still does appear to me, that just such, and from just\n\nsuch necessity, is the President’s struggle in this case. Some time after my colleague (Mr.Richardson) introduced the resolutions I have mentioned, I introduced apreamble, resolution, and interrogatories, intended to draw the President out, if possible, on this hitherto untrodden ground.\n\nTo show their relevancy, I propose to state my understanding of the true rule for\n\nascertaining the boundary between Texas and Mexico. It is, thatwhereverTexas wasexercisingjurisdiction was hers; andwherever Mexicowas exercising jurisdiction was hers; and thatwhateverseparated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of the one from that of the other,\n\nwas the true boundary between them. If, as is probably true, Texas was exercising\n\njurisdiction along the western bank of the Nueces, and Mexico was exercising it along\n\nthe eastern bank of the Rio Grande, thenneitherriver was the boundary, but the uninhabited country between the two was. The extent\n\nof our territory in that region depended, not on anytreaty-fixedboundary, (for no treaty had attempted it,) but on revolution. Any people any where,\n\nbeing inclined and having the power, have therightto rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them\n\nbetter. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right—a right which, we hope and believe,\n\nis to liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole\n\npeople of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people\n\nthatcan mayrevolutionize, and make theirownof so much of the territory as they inhabit. More than this, amajorityof any portion of such people may revolutionize, putting down aminority, intermingled with, or near about them, who may oppose their movements. Such minority\n\nwas precisely the case of the tories of our ownrevolution. It is a quality of revolutions not to go byoldlines, oroldlaws; but to break up both, and make new ones. As to the country now in question,\n\nwe bought it of France in 1803, and sold it to Spain in 1819, according to the President’s\n\nstatement. After this, all Mexico, including Texas, revolutionized against Spain;\n\nand still later, Texas revolutionized against Mexico.13In my view, just so far as she carried her revolution, by obtaining theactual, willing or unwilling, submission of the people,so farthe country was hers, and no farther.<Page 9>Now, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence, as to whether Texas\n\nhad actually carried her revolution to the place where the hostilities of the present\n\nwar commenced, let the President answer theinterrogatoriesI proposed, as before mentioned, or some other similar ones. Let him answer fully,\n\nfairly, and candidly. Let him answer withfacts, and not with arguments. Let him remember he sits whereWashingtonsat; and, so remembering, let him answer as Washington would answer. As a nationshouldnot, and the Almightywillnot, be evaded, so let him attempt no evasion, no equivocation. And if, so answering,\n\nhe can show that the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was shed—that\n\nit was not within an inhabited country, or, if within such, that the inhabitants had\n\nsubmitted themselves to the civil authority of Texas, or of the United States, and\n\nthat the same is true of the site ofFort Brown—then I am with him for his justification. In that case, I shall be most happy to\n\nreverse the vote I gave the other day. I have a selfish motive for desiring that\n\nthe President may do this; I expect to give some votes, in connection with the war,\n\nwhich, without his so doing, will be of doubtful propriety, in my own judgment, but\n\nwhich will be free from the doubt, if he does so. But if hecannot, orwillnot do this—if, on any pretence, or no pretence, he shall refuse or omit it—then\n\nI shall be fully convinced, of what I more than suspect already, that he is deeply\n\nconscious of being in the wrong; that he feels the blood of this war, likethe blood ofAbel, is crying to Heaven against him;14that he orderedGeneral Taylorinto the midst of a peaceful Mexican settlement purposely to bring on a war, that,\n\noriginally having some strong motive—what, I will not stop now to give my opinion\n\nconcerning—to involve the two countries in a war, and, trusting to escape scrutiny\n\nby fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory—that attractive\n\nrainbow, that rises in showers of blood—that serpent’s eye, that charms to destroy—he\n\nplunged into it, and has sweptonandon, till, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which Mexico might be subdued,\n\nhe now finds himself he knows not where. How like the half insane mumbling of a fever\n\ndream is the whole war part of the latemessage! At one time telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever that we can get but territory;\n\nat another, showing us how we can support the war by levying contributions on Mexico.\n\nAt one time urging the national honor, the security of the future, the prevention\n\nof foreign interference, and even the good of Mexico herself, as among the objects\n\nof the war; at another, telling us that, “to reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of territory, would be to abandon\n\nall our just demands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses,without a purpose or definite object.” So, then,<Page 10>he national honor, security of the future, and everything but territorial indemnity,\n\nmay be considered theno-purposesandindefiniteobjects of the war! But, having it now settled that territorial indemnity is the\n\nonly object, we are urged to seize, by legislation here, all that he was content to\n\ntake a few months ago, and the whole province of LowerCaliforniato boot, and to still carry on the war—to takeallwe are fighting for, andstillfight on. Again, the President is resolved, under all circumstances, to have full\n\nterritorial indemnity for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we\n\nare to get theexcessafter those expenses shall have surpassed the value of thewholeof the Mexican territory. So, again, he insists that the separate national existence\n\nof Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell ushowthis can be done after we shall have takenallher territory. Lest the questions I here suggest be considered speculative merely,\n\nlet me be indulged a moment in trying to show they are not. The war has gone on some\n\ntwenty months; for the expenses of which, together with an inconsiderable old score,\n\nthe President now claims about one-half of the Mexican territory, and that by far\n\nthe better half, so far as concerns our ability to make anything out of it.Itis comparatively uninhabited; so that we could establish land offices in it, and\n\nraise some money in that way. But the other half is already inhabited, as I understand\n\nit, tolerably densely for the nature of the country; and all its lands, or all that\n\nare valuable, already appropriated as private property. How, then, are we to make\n\nanything out of these lands with this incumbrance on them, or how remove the incumbrance?\n\nI suppose no one will say we should kill the people, or drive them out, or make slaves\n\nof them, or even confiscate their property? How, then, can we make much out of this\n\npart of the territory? If the prosecution of the war has, in expenses, already equalled\n\nthebetterhalf of the country, how long its future prosecution will be in equalling the less\n\nvaluable half is not aspeculative, but apracticalquestion, pressing closely upon us; and yet it is a question which the President\n\nseems to never have thought of. As to the mode of terminating the war, and securing\n\npeace, the President is equally wandering and indefinite. First, it is to be done\n\nby amore vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemy’s country; and, after apparently talking himself tired on this point, the President drops down\n\ninto a half despairing tone, and tells us that, “with a people distracted and divided by contending factions, and a government subject\n\nto constant changes, by successive revolutions,the continued success of our arms may fail to obtain a satisfactory peace.” Then he suggest the propriety of wheedling the Mexican people to desert the counsels\n\nof their own leaders, and, trusting in our protection, to set up a government from\n\nwhich we can secure a<Page 11>satisfactory peace; telling us that “this may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace.” But soon he falls into doubt of this too, and then drops back on to the already\n\nhalf-abandoned ground of “more vigorous prosecution.” All this shows that the President is in no wise satisfied with his own positions.\n\nFirst, he takes up one, and, in attempting to argue usintoit, he argues himselfoutof it; then seizes another, and goes through the same process; and then, confused\n\nat being able to think of nothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which he\n\nhas some time before cast off. His mind, tasked beyond its power, is running hither\n\nand thither, like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding no position\n\non which it can settle down, and be at ease.15 Again, it is a singular omission in thismessagethat it nowhere intimateswhenthe President expects the war to terminate. At its beginningGen.Scottwas, by this same President, driven into disfavor, if not disgrace, for intimating\n\nthat peace could not be conquered in less than three or four months.16 But now, at the end of about twenty months, during which time our arms have given\n\nus the most splendid successes—every department, and every part, land and water, officers\n\nand privates, regulars and volunteers, doing all that mencoulddo, and hundreds of things which it had ever before been thought men couldnotdo; after all this, this same President gives us a longmessagewithout showing us that,as to the end, he has himself even an imaginary conception. As I have before said, he knows not\n\nwhere he is. He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man. God grant\n\nhe may be able to show there is not something about his conscience more painful than\n\nall his mental perplexity!",

      "deception. The issue, as he presents it, is in these words: “But there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the ground that the",
      "true western boundary ofTexasis theNueces, instead of theRio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching our army to the east bank of the latter river,",
      "we passed the Texan line, and invaded the territory of Mexico.”7Now this issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative. The main deception",
      "of it is, that it assumes as true thatoneriver or theotheris necessarily the boundary, and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the",
      "idea, thatpossiblythe boundary is somewherebetweenthe two, and not actually at either. A further deception is, that it will let inevidencewhich a true issue would exclude. A true issue, made by the President, would be",
      "about as follows: “I say the soilwas ourson which the first blood was shed; there are those who say it was not.” I now proceed to examine the President’s evidence, as applicable to such an issue.",
      "When that evidence is analyzed, it is all included in the following propositions: 1. That the Rio Grande was the western boundary ofLouisiana, as wepurchasedit ofFrancein 1803. 2. That the republic of Texas alwaysclaimedthe Rio Grande as her western boundary. 3.",
      "That, by various acts, she had claimed iton paper. 4. ThatSanta Anna, in his treaty with Texas, recognised the Rio Grande as her boundary. 5. That Texasbefore, and the United Statesafterannexation, hadexercisedjurisdictionbeyondthe Nueces,betweenthe two rivers. 6.",
      "That our Congressunderstoodthe boundary of Texas to extend beyond the Nueces. Now for each of these in its turn: His first item is, that the Rio Grande was the western boundary of Louisiana, as we",
      "purchased it of France in 1803; and, seeming to expect this to be disputed, he argues",
      "over the amount of nearly a page to prove it true; at the end of which he lets us",
      "know that, by thetreaty of 1819, we sold toSpainthe whole country, from the Rio Grande eastward to theSabine. Now, admitting, for the present, that the Rio Grande was the boundary of Louisiana,",
      "what, under Heaven, had that to do with thepresentboundary between us and Mexico? How, Mr. Chairman, the line that once divided your",
      "land from mine canstillbe the boundary between usafterI have sold my land to you, is, to me, beyond all comprehension. And how any man,",
      "with an honest purpose only of proving the truth, could ever havethoughtof introducing such a fact to prove such an issue, is equally incomprehensible. The",
      "outrage upon commonright, of seizing as our own what we have once sold, merely because itwasoursbeforewe sold it, is only equalled by the outrage on commonsenseof any attempt to justify it. His next piece of evidence is, that “the republic of Texas alwaysclaimedthis river (Rio Grande) as her western boundary.”8That is not true, in fact. Texashasclaimed it, but she has notalwaysclaimed it. There is, at least, one distinguished exception. Her State constitution,",
      "the republic’s most solemn and well considered act, that which may, without impropriety,",
      "be called her last will and testament, revoking all others, makes no such claim.9But suppose she had always claimed it. Has not Mexico always claimed the contrary?",
      "So that there is butclaimagainstclaim, leaving nothing proved until we get back of the claims, and find which has the betterfoundation. Though not in the order in which the President presents his evidence, I<Page 6>now consider that class of his statements which are, in substance, nothing more than",
      "that Texas has, by various acts of her convention and congress, claimed the Rio Grande",
      "as her boundary,on paper. I mean, here, what he says about the fixing of the Rio Grande as her boundary in",
      "her old constitution (not her State constitution) about forming congressional districts,",
      "counties, &c.10Now all of this is but nakedclaim;and what I have already said about claims is strictly applicable to this. If I should",
      "claim your land by word of mouth, that certainly would not make it mine; and if I",
      "were to claim it by a deed which I had made myself, and with which you had had nothing",
      "to do, the claim would be quite the same in substance, or rather in utter nothingness. I next consider the President’s statement that Santa Anna, in histreatywith Texas, recognised the Rio Grande as the western boundary of Texas. Besides, the position so often",
      "taken that Santa Anna, while a prisoner of war—a captive—couldnot bind Mexico by a treaty, which I deem conclusive; besides this, I wish to say",
      "something in relation to this treaty, so called by the President, with Santa Anna.",
      "If any man would like to be amused by a sight of thatlittlething, which the President calls by thatbigname, he can have it by turning toNiles’ Register, volume 50, page 336. And if any one should suppose thatNiles’ Registeris a curious repository of so mighty a document as a solemn treaty between nations,",
      "I can only say that I learned, to a tolerable degree of certainty, by inquiry at the",
      "State Department, that the President himself never saw it any where else. By the",
      "way, I believe I should not err if I were to declare that, during the first ten years",
      "of the existence of that document, it was never, by any body,calleda treaty; that it was never so called till the President, in his extremity, attempted,",
      "by so calling it, to wring something from it in justification of himself in connexion with the Mexican war. It has none of the distinguishing features of a treaty. It",
      "does not call itself a treaty. Santa Anna does not therein assume to bind Mexico;",
      "he assumes only to act as the president, commander-in-chief of the Mexican army and",
      "navy; stipulates that the then present hostilities should cease, and that he would",
      "nothimselftake up arms, norinfluencethe Mexican people to take up arms, against Texas during the existence of the war",
      "of independence. He did not recognise the independence of Texas; he did not assume to put an end to the war, but clearly",
      "indicated his expectation of its continuance; he did not say one word about boundary,",
      "and most probably never thought of it. Itisstipulated therein that the Mexican forces should evacuate the territory of Texas,passing to the other side of the Rio Grande;and in another article it is stipulated that, to prevent collisions between the armies,",
      "the Texan army should not approach<Page 7>nearer than within five leagues—ofwhatis not said—but clearly, from the object stated, it is of the Rio Grande. Now, if",
      "this is a treaty recognising the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the singular feature of stipulating",
      "that Texas shall not go within five leagues ofher ownboundary.11 Next comes the evidence of Texas before annexation, and the United States afterwards,exercisingjurisdictionbeyondthe Nueces, andbetweenthe two rivers. This actualexerciseof jurisdiction is the very class or quality of evidence we want. It is excellent",
      "so far as it goes, but does it go far enough? He tells us it wentbeyondthe Nueces, but he does not tell us it wenttothe Rio Grande. He tells us jurisdiction was exercisedbetweenthe two rivers, but he does not tell us it was exercised overallthe territory between them.",
      "Some simple minded people think it ispossibleto cross one river and gobeyondit, without goingall the wayto the next; that jurisdiction may be exercisedbetweentwo rivers without coveringallthe country between them. I know a man, not very unlike myself, who exercises jurisdiction",
      "over a piece of land between theWabashand theMississippi; and yet so far is this from beingallthere is between those rivers, that it is just one hundred and fifty-two feet long",
      "by fifty wide, and no part of it much within a hundred miles of either. He has a neighbor",
      "between him and the Mississippi—that is, just across the street, in that direction—whom,",
      "I am sure, he could neitherpersuadenorforceto give up his habitation; but which, nevertheless, he could certainly annex, if",
      "it were to be done, by merely standing on his own side of the street andclaimingit, or even sitting down and writing adeedfor it. But next, the President tells us, the Congress of the United Statesunderstoodthe State of Texas they admitted into the Union to extendbeyondthe Nueces. Well, I suppose they did—Icertainly so understand it—but howfarbeyond? The Congress didnotunderstand it to extend clear to the Rio Grande, is quite certain by the fact of",
      "their joint resolutions for admission expressly leaving all questions of boundary",
      "to future adjustment. And it may be added, that Texas herself is proved to have had",
      "the same understanding of it that our Congress had, by the fact of the exact conformity",
      "of her new constitution to those resolutions.12 I am now through the whole of the President’s evidence; and it is a singular fact,",
      "that if any one should declare the President sent the army into the midst of a settlement",
      "of Mexican people, who had never submitted, by consent or by force, to the authority",
      "of Texas or of the United States, and thatthere, andthereby, the first blood of the war was shed, there is not one word in all the President",
      "has said which would either admit or deny the declaration. In this strange omission",
      "chiefly consists the deception<Page 8>of the President’s evidence; an omission which, it does seem to me, could scarcely",
      "have occurred but by design. My way of living leads me to be about the courts of justice;",
      "and there I have sometimes seen a good lawyer, struggling for his client’s neck, in",
      "a desperate case, employing every artifice to work round, befog, and cover up with",
      "many words, some position pressed upon him by the prosecution, which hedarednot admit, and yetcouldnot deny. Party bias may help to make it appear so; but, with all the allowance I",
      "can make for such bias, it still does appear to me, that just such, and from just",
      "such necessity, is the President’s struggle in this case. Some time after my colleague (Mr.Richardson) introduced the resolutions I have mentioned, I introduced apreamble, resolution, and interrogatories, intended to draw the President out, if possible, on this hitherto untrodden ground.",
      "To show their relevancy, I propose to state my understanding of the true rule for",
      "ascertaining the boundary between Texas and Mexico. It is, thatwhereverTexas wasexercisingjurisdiction was hers; andwherever Mexicowas exercising jurisdiction was hers; and thatwhateverseparated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of the one from that of the other,",
      "was the true boundary between them. If, as is probably true, Texas was exercising",
      "jurisdiction along the western bank of the Nueces, and Mexico was exercising it along",
      "the eastern bank of the Rio Grande, thenneitherriver was the boundary, but the uninhabited country between the two was. The extent",
      "of our territory in that region depended, not on anytreaty-fixedboundary, (for no treaty had attempted it,) but on revolution. Any people any where,",
      "being inclined and having the power, have therightto rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them",
      "better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right—a right which, we hope and believe,",
      "is to liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole",
      "people of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people",
      "thatcan mayrevolutionize, and make theirownof so much of the territory as they inhabit. More than this, amajorityof any portion of such people may revolutionize, putting down aminority, intermingled with, or near about them, who may oppose their movements. Such minority",
      "was precisely the case of the tories of our ownrevolution. It is a quality of revolutions not to go byoldlines, oroldlaws; but to break up both, and make new ones. As to the country now in question,",
      "we bought it of France in 1803, and sold it to Spain in 1819, according to the President’s",
      "statement. After this, all Mexico, including Texas, revolutionized against Spain;",
      "and still later, Texas revolutionized against Mexico.13In my view, just so far as she carried her revolution, by obtaining theactual, willing or unwilling, submission of the people,so farthe country was hers, and no farther.<Page 9>Now, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence, as to whether Texas",
      "had actually carried her revolution to the place where the hostilities of the present",
      "war commenced, let the President answer theinterrogatoriesI proposed, as before mentioned, or some other similar ones. Let him answer fully,",
      "fairly, and candidly. Let him answer withfacts, and not with arguments. Let him remember he sits whereWashingtonsat; and, so remembering, let him answer as Washington would answer. As a nationshouldnot, and the Almightywillnot, be evaded, so let him attempt no evasion, no equivocation. And if, so answering,",
      "he can show that the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was shed—that",
      "it was not within an inhabited country, or, if within such, that the inhabitants had",
      "submitted themselves to the civil authority of Texas, or of the United States, and",
      "that the same is true of the site ofFort Brown—then I am with him for his justification. In that case, I shall be most happy to",
      "reverse the vote I gave the other day. I have a selfish motive for desiring that",
      "the President may do this; I expect to give some votes, in connection with the war,",
      "which, without his so doing, will be of doubtful propriety, in my own judgment, but",
      "which will be free from the doubt, if he does so. But if hecannot, orwillnot do this—if, on any pretence, or no pretence, he shall refuse or omit it—then",
      "I shall be fully convinced, of what I more than suspect already, that he is deeply",
      "conscious of being in the wrong; that he feels the blood of this war, likethe blood ofAbel, is crying to Heaven against him;14that he orderedGeneral Taylorinto the midst of a peaceful Mexican settlement purposely to bring on a war, that,",
      "originally having some strong motive—what, I will not stop now to give my opinion",
      "concerning—to involve the two countries in a war, and, trusting to escape scrutiny",
      "by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory—that attractive",
      "rainbow, that rises in showers of blood—that serpent’s eye, that charms to destroy—he",
      "plunged into it, and has sweptonandon, till, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which Mexico might be subdued,",
      "he now finds himself he knows not where. How like the half insane mumbling of a fever",
      "dream is the whole war part of the latemessage! At one time telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever that we can get but territory;",
      "at another, showing us how we can support the war by levying contributions on Mexico.",
      "At one time urging the national honor, the security of the future, the prevention",
      "of foreign interference, and even the good of Mexico herself, as among the objects",
      "of the war; at another, telling us that, “to reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of territory, would be to abandon",
      "all our just demands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses,without a purpose or definite object.” So, then,<Page 10>he national honor, security of the future, and everything but territorial indemnity,",
      "may be considered theno-purposesandindefiniteobjects of the war! But, having it now settled that territorial indemnity is the",
      "only object, we are urged to seize, by legislation here, all that he was content to",
      "take a few months ago, and the whole province of LowerCaliforniato boot, and to still carry on the war—to takeallwe are fighting for, andstillfight on. Again, the President is resolved, under all circumstances, to have full",
      "territorial indemnity for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we",
      "are to get theexcessafter those expenses shall have surpassed the value of thewholeof the Mexican territory. So, again, he insists that the separate national existence",
      "of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell ushowthis can be done after we shall have takenallher territory. Lest the questions I here suggest be considered speculative merely,",
      "let me be indulged a moment in trying to show they are not. The war has gone on some",
      "twenty months; for the expenses of which, together with an inconsiderable old score,",
      "the President now claims about one-half of the Mexican territory, and that by far",
      "the better half, so far as concerns our ability to make anything out of it.Itis comparatively uninhabited; so that we could establish land offices in it, and",
      "raise some money in that way. But the other half is already inhabited, as I understand",
      "it, tolerably densely for the nature of the country; and all its lands, or all that",
      "are valuable, already appropriated as private property. How, then, are we to make",
      "anything out of these lands with this incumbrance on them, or how remove the incumbrance?",
      "I suppose no one will say we should kill the people, or drive them out, or make slaves",
      "of them, or even confiscate their property? How, then, can we make much out of this",
      "part of the territory? If the prosecution of the war has, in expenses, already equalled",
      "thebetterhalf of the country, how long its future prosecution will be in equalling the less",
      "valuable half is not aspeculative, but apracticalquestion, pressing closely upon us; and yet it is a question which the President",
      "seems to never have thought of. As to the mode of terminating the war, and securing",
      "peace, the President is equally wandering and indefinite. First, it is to be done",
      "by amore vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemy’s country; and, after apparently talking himself tired on this point, the President drops down",
      "into a half despairing tone, and tells us that, “with a people distracted and divided by contending factions, and a government subject",
      "to constant changes, by successive revolutions,the continued success of our arms may fail to obtain a satisfactory peace.” Then he suggest the propriety of wheedling the Mexican people to desert the counsels",
      "of their own leaders, and, trusting in our protection, to set up a government from",
      "which we can secure a<Page 11>satisfactory peace; telling us that “this may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace.” But soon he falls into doubt of this too, and then drops back on to the already",
      "half-abandoned ground of “more vigorous prosecution.” All this shows that the President is in no wise satisfied with his own positions.",
      "First, he takes up one, and, in attempting to argue usintoit, he argues himselfoutof it; then seizes another, and goes through the same process; and then, confused",
      "at being able to think of nothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which he",
      "has some time before cast off. His mind, tasked beyond its power, is running hither",
      "and thither, like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding no position",
      "on which it can settle down, and be at ease.15 Again, it is a singular omission in thismessagethat it nowhere intimateswhenthe President expects the war to terminate. At its beginningGen.Scottwas, by this same President, driven into disfavor, if not disgrace, for intimating",
      "that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four months.16 But now, at the end of about twenty months, during which time our arms have given",
      "us the most splendid successes—every department, and every part, land and water, officers",
      "and privates, regulars and volunteers, doing all that mencoulddo, and hundreds of things which it had ever before been thought men couldnotdo; after all this, this same President gives us a longmessagewithout showing us that,as to the end, he has himself even an imaginary conception. As I have before said, he knows not",
      "where he is. He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man. God grant",
      "he may be able to show there is not something about his conscience more painful than"

        "text": "16President Polk and General Winfield Scott had a contentious and tenuous relationship\n                  from the beginning of Polk’s administration.  A protégé ofAndrew Jackson, Polk shared his mentor’s distrust of the army officer corps, seeking it as a bastion\n                  of Whiggery.  Scott’s feud with Jackson, which stretched back to theWar of 1812and intensified during Jackson’s presidency, pushed Scott into the Whig camp, and\n                  his presidential ambitions further increased Polk’s suspicions of his senior general.\n                  Nevertheless, on May 13, 1846, the day he signed the declaration of war, Polk asked\n                  Scott to command the army in Mexico.  Scott accepted the assignment, but Polk immediately\n                  became unhappy with Scott’s plan for equipping, training, and transporting 20,000\n                  volunteers to the front, which he believed could not be accomplished until September\n                  1846.  Needing a quick victory in a controversial war, Polk felt that at best Scott\n                  was dragging his feet or at worst was sabotaging the war effort for political purposes.\n                  For his part, Scott believed that Polk was set on discrediting him and the army in\n                  the eyes of the public by advocating action before preparations were complete.  The\n                  conflict came to a head when Scott wrote numerous inflammatory letters, which Polk\n                  used as a pretext to remove him from command.  Scott remained inWashington, DC, whileZachary Taylorled the U.S. forces in Northern Mexico.Reprimanded and consigned to administrative duties, Scott was unfazed, and he began\n                  drawing up an ambitious strategy to end the war by capturingMexico Cityby way ofVeracruz.  By November 1846, it had become clear that Taylor’s offensive in Northern Mexico\n                  would not be decisive, and Polk recalled Scott to execute his plan.  Scott launched\n                  the invasion in February 1847, and captured Mexico City in September 1847.  Scott\n                  became embroiled, however, in a conflict with subordinate officers Gideon Pillow,\n                  an old friend of President Polk, andWilliam   J. Worth, resulting in Scott having both arrested.  Polk and Secretary of WarWilliam L. Marcybacked Pillow and Worth, and Polk used this as a pretext to relieve Scott from command.\n                  On January 3, 1848, Polk recalled Scott from Mexico and ten days later Secretary Marcy\n                  replaced him with GeneralWilliam O. Butler.   On January 31 and April 17, Lincoln voted for resolutions calling upon President\n                  Polk to explain Scott’s removal from command.U.S. HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 331, 689-90; Walter R.

I am\n               one of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under my best impression of thetruthof the case.  How I got this impression, and how it may possibly be removed,  I will\n               now try to show.  When the war began, it was my opinion that all those who, because\n               of knowing toolittle, or because of knowing toomuch, could not conscientiously approve the conduct of the President—in the beginning\n               of it, should, nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on that\n               point, at least till the war should be ended.  Some leadingdemocrats, including ExPresident Van Buren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered to it, and acted\n               upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think I should still adhere to it,\n               were it not that the President and his friends will not allow it to be so.  Besides,\n               the continual effort of the President to argue every silent vote given for supplies\n               into an endorsement of the justice and wisdom of his conduct, besides that singularly\n               candid paragraph in his latemessage,  in which he tells us thatCongress, with great unanimity, only two in theSenateand fourteen in the House dissenting, had declared that “by the act of the Republic ofMexicoa state of war exists between that Government and the United States;” when the same journals that informed him of this, also informed him that, when\n               that declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies, sixty-seven in\n               the House, and not fourteen, merely, voted against it;4besides this open attempt to prove, by telling thetruth, what he could not prove by telling thewhole truth, demanding of all who will not submit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves,\n               to speak out; besides all this, one of my colleagues, (Mr.Richardson,) at a very early day in the session, brought in a set of resolutions, expressly\n               endorsing the<Page 4>original justice of the war on the part of the President.5Upon these resolutions, when they shall be put on their passage, I shall becompelledto vote; so that I cannot be silent if I would. Seeing this, I went about preparing\n               myself to give the vote understandingly, when it should come.  I carefully examined\n               the President’s messages, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the\n               point.  The result of this examination was to make the impression, that taking for\n               true all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his justification;\n               and that the President would have gone farther with his proof, if it had not been\n               for the small matter, that thetruthwould not permit him. Under the impression thus made, I gave the vote before mentioned.\n               I propose now to give, concisely, the process of the examination I made, and how I\n               reached the conclusion I did. The President, in his first message of May, 1846, declares\n               that the soil wasourson which hostilities were commenced by Mexico; and he repeats that declaration, almost\n               in the same language, in each successive annual message; thus showing that he esteems\n               that point a highly essential one.6In the importance of that point, I entirely agree with the President.  To my judgment,\n               it is thevery pointupon which he should be justified or condemned. In his message of December, 1846,\n               it seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly true, that title, ownership to soil,\n               or any thing else, is not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following one or more\n               simple facts; and, that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which\n               he concluded the soil was ours, on which the first blood of the war was shed."

Now, I propose to try to\n               show that the whole of this—issue and evidence—is, from beginning to end, the sheerest\n               deception.  The issue, as he presents it, is in these words: “But there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the ground that the\n                  true western boundary ofTexasis theNueces, instead of theRio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching our army to the east bank of the latter river,\n                  we passed the Texan line, and invaded the territory of Mexico.”7Now this issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative.  The main deception\n               of it is, that it assumes as true thatoneriver or theotheris necessarily the boundary, and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the\n               idea, thatpossiblythe boundary is somewherebetweenthe two, and not actually at either.  A further deception is, that it will let inevidencewhich a true issue would exclude.  A true issue, made by the President, would be\n               about as follows: “I say the soilwas ourson which the first blood was shed; there are those who say it was not.”"

Texashasclaimed it,  but she has notalwaysclaimed it.  There is, at least, one distinguished exception.  Her State constitution,\n               the republic’s most solemn and well considered act, that which may, without impropriety,\n               be called her last will and testament, revoking all others, makes no such claim.9But suppose she had always claimed it.

Besides, the position so often\n               taken that Santa Anna, while a prisoner of war—a captive—couldnot bind Mexico by a treaty, which I deem conclusive; besides this, I wish to say\n               something in relation to this treaty, so called by the President, with Santa Anna.\n               If any man would like to be amused by a sight of thatlittlething, which the President calls by thatbigname, he can have it by turning toNiles’ Register, volume 50, page 336.  And if any one should suppose thatNiles’ Registeris a curious repository of so mighty a document as a solemn treaty between nations,\n               I can only say that I learned, to a tolerable degree of certainty, by inquiry at the\n               State Department, that the President himself never saw it any where else.  By the\n               way, I believe I should not err if I were to declare that, during the first ten years\n               of the existence of that document, it was never, by any body,calleda treaty; that it was never so called till the President, in his extremity, attempted,\n               by so calling it, to wring something from it in justification of himself in connexion with the Mexican war.  It has none of the distinguishing features of a treaty.  It\n               does not call itself a treaty.  Santa Anna does not therein assume to bind Mexico;\n               he assumes only to act as the president, commander-in-chief of the Mexican army and\n               navy; stipulates that the then present hostilities should cease, and that he would\n               nothimselftake up arms, norinfluencethe Mexican people to take up arms, against Texas during the existence of the war\n               of independence.  He did not recognise the independence of Texas; he did not assume to put an end to the war, but clearly\n               indicated his expectation of its continuance; he did not say one word about boundary,\n               and most probably never thought of it.  Itisstipulated therein that the Mexican forces should evacuate the territory of Texas,passing to the other side of the Rio Grande;and in another article it is stipulated that, to prevent collisions between the armies,\n               the Texan army should not approach<Page 7>nearer than within five leagues—ofwhatis not said—but clearly, from the object stated, it is of the Rio Grande.  Now, if\n               this is a treaty recognising the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the singular feature of stipulating\n               that Texas shall not go within five leagues ofher ownboundary.11"

It is, thatwhereverTexas wasexercisingjurisdiction was hers; andwherever Mexicowas exercising jurisdiction was hers; and thatwhateverseparated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of the one from that of the other,\n               was the true boundary between them. If, as is probably true, Texas was exercising\n               jurisdiction along the western bank of the Nueces, and Mexico was exercising it along\n               the eastern bank of the Rio Grande, thenneitherriver was the boundary, but the uninhabited country between the two was. The extent\n               of our territory in that region depended, not on anytreaty-fixedboundary, (for no treaty had attempted it,) but on revolution.  Any people any where,\n               being inclined and having the power, have therightto rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them\n               better.  This is a most valuable, a most sacred right—a right which, we hope and believe,\n               is to liberate the world.  Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole\n               people of an existing government may choose to exercise it.  Any portion of such people\n               thatcan mayrevolutionize, and make theirownof so much of the territory as they inhabit. More than this, amajorityof any portion of such people may revolutionize, putting down aminority, intermingled with, or near about them, who may oppose their movements.  Such minority\n               was precisely the case of the tories of our ownrevolution.  It is a quality of revolutions not to go byoldlines, oroldlaws; but to break up both, and make new ones.  As to the country now in question,\n               we bought it of France in 1803, and sold it to Spain in 1819, according to the President’s\n               statement.  After this, all Mexico, including Texas, revolutionized against Spain;\n               and still later, Texas revolutionized against Mexico.13In my view, just so far as she carried her revolution, by obtaining theactual, willing or unwilling, submission of the people,so farthe country was hers, and no farther.<Page 9>Now, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence, as to whether Texas\n               had actually carried her revolution to the place where the hostilities of the present\n               war commenced, let the President answer theinterrogatoriesI proposed, as before mentioned, or some other similar ones. Let him answer fully,\n               fairly, and candidly.  Let him answer withfacts, and not with arguments.  Let him remember he sits whereWashingtonsat; and, so remembering, let him answer as Washington would answer.  As a nationshouldnot, and the Almightywillnot, be evaded, so let him attempt no evasion, no equivocation. And if, so answering,\n               he can show that the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was shed—that\n               it was not within an inhabited country, or, if within such, that the inhabitants had\n               submitted themselves to the civil authority of Texas, or of the United States, and\n               that the same is true of the site ofFort Brown—then I am with him for his justification.  In that case, I shall be most happy to\n               reverse the vote I gave the other day.  I have a selfish motive for desiring that\n               the President may do this; I expect to give some votes, in connection with the war,\n               which, without his so doing, will be of doubtful propriety, in my own judgment, but\n               which will be free from the doubt, if he does so. But if hecannot, orwillnot do this—if, on any pretence, or no pretence, he shall refuse or omit it—then\n               I shall be fully convinced, of what I more than suspect already, that he is deeply\n               conscious of being in the wrong; that he feels the blood of this war, likethe blood ofAbel, is crying to Heaven against him;14that he orderedGeneral Taylorinto the midst of a peaceful Mexican settlement purposely to bring on a war, that,\n               originally having some strong motive—what, I will not stop now to give my opinion\n               concerning—to involve the two countries in a war, and, trusting to escape scrutiny\n               by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory—that attractive\n               rainbow, that rises in  showers of blood—that serpent’s eye, that charms to destroy—he\n               plunged into it, and has sweptonandon, till, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which Mexico might be subdued,\n               he now finds himself he knows not where.  How like the half insane mumbling of a fever\n               dream is the whole war part of the latemessage! At one time telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever that we can get but territory;\n               at another, showing us how we can support the war by levying contributions on Mexico.\n               At one time urging the national honor, the security of the future, the prevention\n               of foreign interference, and even the good of Mexico herself, as among the objects\n               of the war; at another, telling us that, “to reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of territory, would be to abandon\n                  all our just demands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses,without a purpose or definite object.” So, then,<Page 10>[t]he national honor, security of the future, and everything but territorial indemnity,\n               may be considered theno-purposesandindefiniteobjects of the war! But, having it now settled that territorial indemnity is the\n               only object, we are urged to seize, by legislation here, all that he was content to\n               take a few months ago, and the whole province of LowerCaliforniato boot, and to still carry on the war—to takeallwe are fighting for, andstillfight on. Again, the President is resolved, under all circumstances, to have full\n               territorial indemnity for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we\n               are to get theexcessafter those expenses shall have surpassed the value of thewholeof the Mexican territory. So, again, he insists that the separate national existence\n               of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell ushowthis can be done after we shall have takenallher territory.  Lest the questions I here suggest be considered speculative merely,\n               let me be indulged a moment in trying to show they are not.  The war has gone on some\n               twenty months; for the expenses of which, together with an inconsiderable old score,\n               the President now claims about one-half of the Mexican territory, and that by far\n               the better half, so far as concerns our ability to make anything out of it.Itis comparatively uninhabited; so that we could establish land offices in it, and\n               raise some money in that way.  But the other half is already inhabited, as I understand\n               it, tolerably densely for the nature of the country; and all its lands, or all that\n               are valuable, already appropriated as private property.  How, then, are we to make\n               anything out of these lands with this incumbrance on them, or how remove the incumbrance?\n               I suppose no one will say we should kill the people, or drive them out, or make slaves\n               of them, or even confiscate their property? How, then, can we make much out of this\n               part of the territory?  If the prosecution of the war has, in expenses, already equalled\n               thebetterhalf of the country, how long its future prosecution will be in equalling the less\n               valuable half is not aspeculative, but apracticalquestion, pressing closely upon us; and yet it is a question which the President\n               seems to never have thought of.  As to the mode of terminating the war, and securing\n               peace, the President is equally wandering and indefinite.  First, it is to be done\n               by amore vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemy’s country; and, after apparently talking himself tired on this point, the President drops down\n               into a half despairing tone, and tells us that, “with a people distracted and divided by contending factions, and a government subject\n                  to constant changes, by successive revolutions,the continued success of our arms may fail to obtain a satisfactory peace.” Then he suggest the propriety of wheedling the Mexican people to desert the counsels\n               of their own leaders, and, trusting in our protection, to set up a government from\n               which we can secure a<Page 11>satisfactory peace; telling us that “this may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace.” But soon he falls into doubt of this too, and then drops back on to the already\n               half-abandoned ground of “more vigorous prosecution.”  All this shows that the President is in no wise satisfied with his own positions.\n               First, he takes up one, and, in attempting to argue usintoit, he argues himselfoutof it; then seizes another, and goes through the same process; and then, confused\n               at being able to think of nothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which he\n               has some time before cast off.  His mind, tasked beyond its power, is running hither\n               and thither, like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding no position\n               on which it can settle down, and be at ease.15"
