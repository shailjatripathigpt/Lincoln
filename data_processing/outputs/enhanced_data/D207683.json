        "text": "2Lincoln had arrived in Chicago on July 15, 1856, with the stated intention that he\n                  would be there two weeks to transact court business. During this two week period,\n                  he gave a politicalspeechin Chicago and also traveled out from Chicago to the cities ofDixon,Sterling,Galena, andOregon, speaking toRepublicanmeetings and in support of RepublicansJohn C. Fremontfor president, andWilliam H. Bissellfor governor. See the1856 Federal Election.No text of the bill that Lincoln had presented to Illinois Central Railroad attorneys\n                  David Stuart and John M. Douglass has been located. The bill was for his work on behalf\n                  of the railroad in the  case ofIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parke. That case  had been finally decided  in January 1856 in theIllinois Supreme Court, which upheld the railroad’s charter as constitutional, and affirmed that under the\n                  charter counties could not tax the railroad.The Illinois Central Railroad did not pay Lincoln’s bill at this time, and he ultimately\n                  instituted a suit against the railroad inMcLean County Circuit Courtin April 1857 in order to collect these fees. Lincoln claimed $6,000 in damages and\n                  was awarded $5,000 by a jury in June 1857. This amount was adjusted down to $4,800\n                  in consideration of a retainer Lincoln had earlier received from the railroad. He\n                  received payment from the railroad in this amount in August 1857.Report of Speech at Galena, Illinois;Report of Speech at Galena, Illinois;Receipt of Abraham Lincoln to Illinois Central Railroad Company;Mason Brayman to Abraham Lincoln;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 15 July 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-07-15; 17 July 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-07-17; 18 July 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-07-18; 19 July 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-07-19; 23 July 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-07-23; 25 July 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-07-25;Illinois Central RR v.
