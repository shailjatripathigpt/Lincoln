        "text": "3Lincoln is referencing a lawsuit between Leonard H. Wilkey and others and Daniel M.\n                  Bailey and others in theTazewell County Circuit Court.In 1831,Samuel P. Baileyand James Bailey conveyed two lots in Pekin, Illinois, by deed of trust to Daniel\n                  Bailey for the payment of debts.  In the same year, Daniel Bailey gave Joshua R. Stanford\n                  power of attorney to carry out the deed's trust duties.  Under that power and with\n                  the Baileys' knowledge, Stanford sold the lots to Rawley Doolittle andPeter Menard, Jr., and Daniel Bailey received the purchase money.  Rawley Doolittle and Menard leased\n                  the lots to Wilkey, then sold the lots toIrwin B. DoolittleandWilliam B. Doolittle.  In 1850, Daniel Bailey sold the same two lots toThomas C. Reeves.  In April 1850, Reeves sued Wilkey, Irwin Doolittle, and William Doolittle in two\n                  actions of ejectment.  Lincoln represented Wilkey and the Doolittles. In September\n                  1850, Irwin Doolittle and William Doolittle sued Bailey and Reeves for an injunction\n                  to stop the ejectment suits.  Lincoln represented the Doolittles. In May 1853, the\n                  court ruled for Reeves in both ejectment cases and dismissed the injunction case.\n                  During these cases, Reeves sold the lots toBenjamin S. Prettyman, and Irwin Doolittle and William Doolittle leased the lots to Charles Yacle and John\n                  Stoltz.  Reeves and Prettyman had notice that Menard, Rawley Doolittle, William Doolittle,\n                  Irwin Doolittle, Wilkey, Yacle, and Stoltz had possession of the lots.  In April 1851,\n                  Prettyman sued Yacle and Stoltz in two actions of ejectment.  Lincoln represented\n                  Yacle and Stoltz. In May 1853, Wilkey, Yacle, Stoltz, William Doolittle, and Irwin\n                  Doolittle retained Lincoln and sued Prettyman, Reeves, Samuel Bailey, James Bailey,\n                  and Daniel Bailey for an injunction to stop the two ejectment cases against Yacle\n                  and Stoltz and to stop the execution of the two ejectment cases against Wilkey and\n                  against Irwin Doolittle and William Doolittle.  In October 1857, the court ruled for\n                  Wilkey and others and dismissed the ejectment cases.  Prettyman and others appealed\n                  the judgment to theIllinois Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment in December 1857. Lincoln did not participate in the\n                  Supreme Court appeal. In October 1858, the Tazewell County Circuit Court dismissed\n                  the ejectment suits against Yacle and Stoltz.Reeves v. Wilkey, Martha L.
