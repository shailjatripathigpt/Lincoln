As to the interpretation of his speech, Lincoln\n                  wrote, \"I am much mortified that any part of it should be construed so differently\n                  from any thing intended by me.\" He continued, \"I have declared a thousand times, and\n                  now repeat that, in my opinion neither the General Government, nor any other power\n                  outside of the slave states, can constitutionally or rightfully interfere with slaves\n                  or slavery where it already exists.\"In the summer and fall of 1858, Lincoln crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches\n                  and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.
