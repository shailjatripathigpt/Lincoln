Douglas were scheduled to debate\n                  one another in Ottawa, Illinois, on August 21 in the first of theLincoln-Douglas Debates. Lincoln was running against Douglas in the1858 Federal Electionas theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate.

        "text": "3If Lincoln wrote a response to this letter, it has not been located. Lincoln traveled\n                  heavily during the summer and fall of 1858, crisscrossing Illinois delivering speeches\n                  and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates. At the time, theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; thus the outcome of the races\n                  for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewas highly relevant to the1858 Federal Election. Lincoln departed Springfield, Illinois, just two days after Wallace wrote this letter.\n                  It is therefore possible that he did not receive it in time to reply. After not receiving\n                  a response, Wallace wrote Lincoln twice more attempting to ascertain Lincoln’s travel\n                  plans for the Ottawa debate.Ultimately, Lincoln traveled by train fromPeoria, IllinoistoMorris, Illinoison Friday, August 20. Then, after spending the night in Morris, he caught the special\n                  train on August 21 as it passed through Morris and journeyed with the crowds on board\n                  to attend the debate in Ottawa, arriving shortly after noon. He was then conveyed\n                  by carriage in a procession toJoseph O. Glover’s house.In the end, in the local elections of 1858, although Republicans won a majority of\n                  all votes cast in Illinois, pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:546-47, 556-57; Allen C.
