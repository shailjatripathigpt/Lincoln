        "text": "2George P. Fisher wrote and signed this endorsement.President Taylor appointed Abraham Lincoln secretary of the Oregon Territory less\n                  than a month after he appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsin  Illinois who had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln the position of  secretary of\n                  the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. In aletterto Secretary of State John M. Clayton dated August 21, 1849, Lincoln declined the\n                  appointment for secretary of the Oregon Territory and recommendedSimeon Francisfor the position instead. LincolnwroteClayton on September 12, 1849, endorsingHart Fellowsas “worthy” of either a judgeship or appointment as secretary of the Oregon Territory,\n                  while also stipulating that Francis was his personal choice for the latter. In this\n                  letter to Clayton, Lincoln enclosed a recommendationletterfor Fellows from Orville H. Browning and others. Lincoln also wrote Clayton aletterSeptember 16, 1849 and aletterSeptember 27, 1849, reiterating his endorsement of Francis for secretary of the Oregon\n                  Territory. In the end, Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhioto the position.On September 20, 1849, in a final effort to ease any tensions caused by Butterfield’s\n                  appointment, the Taylor administration also offered Lincoln appointment as governor\n                  of the Oregon Territory. After serious consideration of this offer, Lincoln also turned\n                  this position down, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing."
