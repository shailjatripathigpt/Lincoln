The speech was one that did him eminent credit, and which\n\ncannot not fail to produce a telling effect upon the political sentiment of Chicago. The exposure\n\nof the fallaciousness of the position taken by Mr.Fillmorein hisAlbanyspeech was timely and effective; and his refutation of the charge of sectionalism,\n\nso flippantly made by the slavery-extensionists against theRepublican party, was full and able.2Every point he touched upon was elucidated by the clearness of his logic, and with\n\nhis keen blade of satire he laid bare the revolting features of policy of the pseudo-Democracy. At the close of his speech he was enthusiastically and repeatedly cheered, and\n\nhe was frequently interrupted during its delivery with hearty and prolonged applause. We hope ere long to be able to announce a speech from Mr.Lincolnin our owncity.3",

Fillmore was traveling inEuropeat the time of his nomination, but accepted via letter and arrived inNew York Cityon June 22. He delivered speeches in numerous towns on his return toBuffalo, New York. In his “Union Speech,” delivered in Albany, New York on June 26, Fillmore called\n                  the Republican Party, which had nominatedJohn C. Fremontas itsfirst national convention,  a “sectional party” that represented only the interests of the free states of the\n                  nation. He argued this was dangerous, and that if the Republican Party gained power\n                  it would lead “inevitably to the destruction” of the nation.Frank H. Severance, ed.,Millard Fillmore Papers, vol. 11 ofPublications of the Buffalo Historical Society(Buffalo, NY: Buffalo Historical Society, 1907), 2:3, 19, 21-22."
