The county assessor levied a $428.57 tax on the railroad's property.  The railroad\n                  claimed that theIllinois General Assemblyact incorporating the railroad exempted the railroad from taxes. In September 1853,\n                  the railroad sued McLean County in theMcLean County Circuit Courtfor an injunction to stop the county from selling railroad land to pay taxes. In\n                  late-September 1853, the parties reached an agreement, in which the circuit court\n                  would dismiss the bill, thus ruling for McLean County, and the railroad would appeal\n                  the case to theIllinois Supreme Court, where the only question would be whether the county had a lawful right to tax the\n                  Illinois Central Railroad’s property.Illinois Central RR v.

        "text": "4Lincoln represented the railroad in its  Illinois Supreme Court case, which began\n                  in December 1853. In December 1855, the  Illinois Supreme Court reversed the judgment\n                  of the McLean County Circuit Court, and  JusticeWalter B. Scatesruled that the Illinois General Assembly could exempt property from taxation.  Therefore,\n                  the Illinois Central Railroad’s charter was constitutional.  Lincoln received $5,000\n                  for his legal services, although he had to sue the railroad in 1857 to collect the\n                  fee.At the request of Brayman, Lincoln declined new cases against the railroad that came\n                  his way between 1853 and 1855, passing at least some on toJohn T. Stuart, and therefore lost opportunities to earn other legal fees as a direct result of\n                  his employment for the railroad.Illinois Central RR v.
