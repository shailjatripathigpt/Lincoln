        "text": "3The mandamus case under discussion isPeople ex rel. Lanphier & Walker v. Hatch. A mandamus is a writ by which a court exercises its authority over a public official\n                  and compels them to perform an official duty. In this instance, the official wasIllinoisSecretary of State Ozias M. Hatch, who had been sued in the Illinois Supreme Court\n                  for a writ of mandamus to furnish state printers Lanphier & Walker of theDemocraticIllinois State Registerwith a true copy of an 1857 bill apportioning representation in theIllinois General Assembly. The bill had been drafted and supported by the Democrats with an eye towards maintaining\n                  their party’s majority in the General Assembly. TheIllinois House of Representativespassed the bill on February 16, 1857, and theIllinois Senateconcurred on February 18.RepublicanGovernorWilliam H. Bissellmistakenly signed the bill then cancelled his signature after his secretary had already\n                  reported his approval to the House. Hatch was represented in this case by Lincoln,Orville H. Browning, andJackson Grimshaw. Neither Koerner nor Gillespie were attorneys of record on this case, although Lincoln\n                  had earlier written similar letters to both requesting their consultation on the matter.A demurrer is an exception by either party of a lawsuit to the points of law made\n                  by the other party. Judges either sustain or overrule the demurrer, and if the  demurrer\n                  is overruled, the demurring party can re-plead on the facts of the case. InPeople ex rel. Lanphier & Walker v. HatchSecretary of State Hatch had answered the charges against him with a return in which\n                  he stated that Governor Bissell had never intended to approve the apportionment bill,\n                  had stricken his signature and issued a veto when he realized his mistake, and that\n                  Hatch himself had never had possession of the bill prior to Bissell’s signature being\n                  cancelled. John A. McClernand, one of the Democratic attorneys representing the plaintiffs,\n                  had demurred this return on the grounds that it was insufficient in law.People ex rel.

        "text": "4Illinois Supreme Court Chief JusticeJohn D. Catonstated in the opinion on this case that the apportionment bill had never become law\n                  because it had remained in Bissell’s possession until he realized his mistake and\n                  struck his signature. JusticeSidney Breeseentered a separate opinion on the case in which he agreed on this point and maintained\n                  that government departments had the right to reconsider a decision as well  as the\n                  power to correct mistakes. Breese further argued that since the bill remained in Bissell’s\n                  custody until he discovered his error, the governor  was only bound by his final action\n                  upon a bill, in this case returning it with his signature cancelled and with an objection,\n                  rather than by the actions of his secretary in reporting the governor’s approval.Opinion, Document ID: 122253,People ex rel.
