The company had encountered significant\n                  opposition inIllinoisin the previous few years and had halted progress on the road. However, a few weeks\n                  after this letter was written, on February 23, theIllinois General Assemblypassed an act to allow the company to begin constructing the railroad. The next day,\n                  February 24, CongressmanRobert Smithwrote aletterto Lincoln and two colleagues, requesting that the recipients explain the precise\n                  legal position of the Mississippi and Atlantic Railroad Company. The lawyers responded\n                  with aletterof  March 1 detailing the flaws in the organization of the company. Nevertheless,\n                  theIllinois Supreme Courtupheld a lower court ruling that the company was legally organized under Illinois\n                  law, with Chief JusticeSamuel H.
