        "text": "2In December 1857, Stephen A. Douglas spoke out against theLecompton Constitutionand criticized President James Buchanan for supporting it, causing a rift in theDemocratic Partyand the emergence of pro-Douglas and pro-Buchanan factions. Wentworth, who strenuously\n                  opposed Douglas, was among the IllinoisRepublicanleaders who hoped that encouraging a separate Buchanan Democratic Party in Illinois\n                  would undermine Douglas.Buchanan Democrats in Illinois held a state convention at the State House in Springfield\n                  on June 9, 1858. No correspondence from Lincoln to the editors of theIllinois State Journalconveying Wentworth’s advice for reporting on this convention has been located, however\n                  the paper published a list of men who had arrived in Springfield the evening preceding\n                  the convention, including titles and honorifics for many. TheIllinois State Journalpublished the proceedings of the convention, including a list of the delegates present,\n                  which it estimated at nearly three hundred people, “all fine looking men”, and editorialized\n                  that the convention was “a most enthusiastic assemblage of Democrats, composed of\n                  many of the leading men of the party in this State.” The paper ended its commentary\n                  on the convention by saying “It is clear that theDouglasiteshave no chance whatever, and their best policy is to abandon their present organization\n                  and unite with the Republicans. We give them a cordial invitation to come over into\n                  our ranks.”TheIllinois State Register, in contrast, referred to the Buchanan Democratic convention variously as “The Bogus\n                  Convention” and “The Seceders’ Convention”, reported that the delegates in attendance\n                  only represented fifteen to twenty of Illinois’ one hundred and one counties, and\n                  accused theIllinois State Journalof listing delegates and counties as being present at the convention when they did\n                  not actually attend.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445; Don E. Fehrenbacher,Chicago Giant: A Biography of Long John Wentworth(Madison, WI: The American History Research Center, 1957), 151-57;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 9 June 1858, 2:1; 10 June 1858, 2:1-4;Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 10 June 1858, 2:1-2; 11 June 1858, 2:1."

        "text": "3The proposed date of adjournment for the first session of the Thirty-Fifth Congress\n                  was changed several times in early June of 1858 as the two house of the U.S. Congress\n                  considered a final flurry of resolutions and bills. TheU.S. Senatepassed a resolution on June 3 to change the date of adjournment from June 7 to June\n                  14, 1858. TheU.S. House of Representativesamended the resolution, suggesting an adjournment date of June 10, to which the Senate\n                  agreed on June 4. Following additional resolutions and discussions, both houses of\n                  the U.S. Congress concurred on June 9 to change the date of adjournment to June 14,\n                  1858. As that day approached, President Buchanan sent a message to Congress on June\n                  12, with a recommendation to postpone adjourning until appropriation bills then under\n                  consideration were passed and the condition of theU.S. Treasurywas assessed and secured. The first session of the Thirty-Fifth Congress adjourned\n                  as planned on June 14, but Buchanan issued a proclamation on that day declaring that\n                  an “extraordinary occasion” required the Senate to convene for a special session on\n                  June 15. The Senate convened for the special session on Tuesday, June 15 and adjourned\n                  the following day.U.S. SenateJournal. 1858. 35th Cong., 1st sess., 595, 597, 604-5, 617, 651; U.S. SenateJournal. 1858. 35th Cong., 2nd special sess., 721; U.S. HouseJournal. 1858. 35th Cong., 1st sess., 1013-14, 1064-65;Cong.

        "text": "5Francis J. Grund arrived in Chicago by late May, 1858 to canvass on behalf of the\n                  Buchanan administration and against Douglas. Although at this time Grund was a resident\n                  ofWashington, DC, he attended the Buchanan Democratic convention in Springfield on June 9, 1858 as\n                  a delegate forCook County, which he apparently justified due to his ownership of property in Chicago. Despite\n                  Wentworth’s fear that Grund would help unite the Buchanan and Douglas wings of the\n                  Democratic Party in Illinois, he was the target of negative press from Douglas supporters,\n                  who accused him of treachery and of being motivated to support Buchanan in the hopes\n                  of obtaining political appointment. Following his return to the east, Grund reportedly\n                  claimed that he had worked to ensure Douglas’ defeat for U.S. Senate, expected to\n                  see a Republican elected to the office, and spoke approvingly of Lincoln.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 29 May 1858, 2:3; 10 June 1858, 2:3;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 3 June 1858, 1:1; 10 June 1858, 3:2;Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 12 June 1858, 2:1; 19 June 1858, 2:2; 21 June 1858, 2:2; 7 July 1858,\n                     2:2;The Weekly Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 16 June 1858, 2:5."
