Theydebatedeach other at seven locations across the state in the lead up to the election.  Outside\n                  the seven debates, Lincoln and Douglas made many stops in towns throughout Illinois\n                  during the campaign period, delivering speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat. Lincoln spoke in Pekin two days before\n                  the fifth debate with Douglas, which occurred inGalesburg, Illinois, on October 7, 1858.  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Allen C.

        "text": "3Douglas accused Lincoln of favoring the corporate interests of theIllinois Central Railroadover the interests of the people, including during a speech on October 2, 1858 in\n                  Pekin. The Illinois Central Railroad was unpopular among many in Illinois due to its\n                  foreclosing on 4,000 mortgages and its attempts to gain tax exempt status with the\n                  State of Illinois. Douglas stated that in the 1840s he had advocated for a higher\n                  tax rate on the railroad than what the General Assembly enacted, and that it was Lincoln’s\n                  faction that got a lower rate for the Illinois Central Railroad. He told the audience\n                  that he had convinced the  U.S. Senate to provide land grants to the State of Illinois\n                  to be used for rail development instead of giving the grants to the railroad companies,\n                  and that theU.S. House of Representatives, of which Lincoln was a member, had defeated the legislation.  Douglas also accused\n                  Lincoln of being  a political tool of the Illinois Central Railroad, referencing a\n                  case where Lincoln received $5,000 to represent the railroad. Abraham Lincoln did\n                  represent the railroad on several cases and received $5,000 for a case againstMcLean County. In that case, the railroad paid Lincoln $200 and he sued the company for the remaining\n                  $4,800. Lincoln denied the charges Douglas leveled  against him.Allen C.

Lincoln was accused of denying the\n                  U.S. military supplies during the conflict, a claim that Lincoln denied in this speech.\n                  Abraham Lincoln first sat inCongressin December 1847, after much of the major fighting in Mexico had ended.      As a\n                  Whig , Lincoln was critical of the Mexican War as well as of PresidentJames K. Polk’s role in the start of the war. Although Lincoln opposed the war and questioned its\n                  constitutionality during his time in theU.S. House of Representatives, he nevertheless always voted for supplies for U.S. troops serving in the field.\n                  Douglas refrained from this avenue of attack on Lincoln, stating on September 20,\n                  1858, ”The fact was this. Lincoln did not vote against any supplies, for they had\n                  been voted before and sent out before Lincoln got to Congress.”Cong.
