    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on Resolution Relative to Public Depositories, 17 January\n\n18391 The resolutions from theSenate, upon the subject of the deposites of public money in the Banks, coming up for consideration—2 Mr.CALHOUNsaid he had been represented by others as being opposed to theState Bank. He was not so. He thought the public money ought to be deposited in the Banks\n\nof thisState, while they continue to be deposited in Banks. He wanted to see the resolutions\n\nput in such a shape as that he could vote for them. He did not wish unjust censure cast any where, and he thought the resolutions in their\n\npresent shape, did so upon thePresidentof the United States. A slight amendment would make the resolutions acceptable to\n\nhim. Mr.WILLIAMSsaid it was immaterial where the fault lie. Whether in theExecutiveof the United States, inCongress, or the Banks. The fact was, the Government is depositing the public money in Banks\n\nout of the State, and he thought it ought to be remedied. The State has chartered\n\nBanks, whose currency circulates among us. One of our Banks has the privilege to\n\nissue small bills, but the deposite act excludes such Banks. He asked whether that law was defensible? The only inquiry\n\nought to be whether the Banks are good, and Congress acted improperly when they undertook\n\nto force the Legislatures of the States to alter their legislation upon the subject.3 Mr.W. said that theSecretary of the Treasuryhad recently selected 16 Banks as depositories which were situated similar to our\n\nown. He did not know that these Banks had issued small bills, but they had not commenced\n\nspecie payments at the last dates. These very Banks had $900,000 on deposite from 1837, which they had not paid. Mr. W. then read from the report of the Secretary\n\nof the Treasury to show the number of Banks which were then employed as depositories.\n\nThe Secretary stated that it was still the duty of the Department to select Bank depositories,\n\nwhere they were not excluded by the deposite act.4 TheSecretaryhad evidently from his report selected Banks as depositors which were situated similarly\n\nwith our own. Mr. W. stated that he had learned from good authority that Mr.Biddle’sBankhad been selected as a special depository, and that he had recently made $10,000\n\nby the operation. Mr. W. thought it was time we had done truckling to the Administration.\n\nOur own Banks might as well have made this $10,000 as Mr. Biddle. Mr.SMITH, ofWabash, asked Mr. Williams to name the sixteen Banks which had been selected. Mr.S. stated it was well known that he had always been in favor of our own Banks and of\n\ntheir having the deposites. Our own branch Bank atQuincyhad been lately made a special depository as he was informed. Mr. Smith said he\n\nwas not satisfied with the remarks of thegentlemanfromAdams. If it was true that the 16 Banks he had named were selected, and if it was true\n\nalso that those Banks were similarly situated to our own, he should certainly vote\n\nfor the original resolutions. Mr. WILLIAMS named the Banks. Mr.CLOUDoffered an amendment to strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the\n\nfollowing: That we consider it but just and right while the General Government continues to make\n\ndeposites with State Banks that the Banks in the States in which the revenue is collected should\n\nbe employed as such depositories where such Banks do not render themselves incapable\n\nof becoming deposite Banks under the acts of Congress regulating the deposites of public moneys. Resolved, That as citizens ofIllinois, and Representatives of the people thereof, we view with regret the deposite of public money collected from our own citizens in our own State, in theBank of Missouri, to the detriment of the citizens and Banks of our own State. Resolved, That if the State Bank of Illinois and the Bank of Illinois atShawneetownshall comply with the regulations enacted by Congress in reference to deposites, and shall properly authenticate the fact to the proper department, we as the Representatives\n\nof the people of the State of Illinois respectfully yet earnestly ask and claim as\n\nan act of justice the deposite of the revenue collected in this State to be made in the banks thereof so long as\n\nthe Government shall continue to deposite her funds with the State Banks, and so long as the Banks of the State conform to\n\nthe acts of Congress on the subject of deposites. Resolved, That if the General Government shall neglect and refuse to deposite the money collected in this State in the Banks thereof after evidence is laid before\n\nthe proper department that the Banks of Illinois have removed all disabilities on\n\ntheir part to become deposite Banks, the people of the State will have just grounds to complain of the policy of\n\nthe General Government as unfair and partial. Resolved, That if proper evidence be given to our Senators and Representatives that the Banks\n\nof Illinois come within the purview of the deposite act, that our Senators be instructed and our Reprhsentatives requested to use their influence to procure the doposites for the Banks of this State. Resolved, That the Governor be requested to forward a copy of the foregoing resolutions to\n\neach of our Senators and Representatives in Congress. Mr.Webb, ofWhitecalled for a division of the question. Mr. WILLIAMS hoped the amendment would not prevail. Mr.HAPPYsaid the gentleman from Adams had not read the whole deposite lawHe then read the entire law. Much pains had been taken to show that this was no party\n\nquestion, yet when we wish to strike out thepartymatter in the resolutions, the gentlemen of theWhig partyrefuse to give us a chance to do so.5Mr. Happy then read from theSangamo Journal, the organ of the Whig party. That paper says that the resolutions are instructions\n\nto our Senators to vote against theSub.Treasurysystem.6It does not say any thing about depositories. What do gentlemen say to this? Those\n\ngentlemen who on this floor, are endeavoring to soft soap the members by sayingthere is no party. Mr. Happy said the gentlemen from Adams had proved that there were onlyfourgeneral depositories in the United States, and the Bank of Missouri happened to\n\nbe one of them.7Ought we to get in a great pet with the General Government for not giving us a share\n\nof the deposites? There were 16 special depositories, and Mr.Hwould ask what would be our share? Two million and a little upwards was the whole\n\namount on deposite in banks, including theNick Biddlebank, which had been spoken of. Mr. H. could not understand that any other object\n\nwas intended than an attack upon the Administration. TheirorganatSpringfieldhad asserted in advance what they were. The editor had been too fast, however, for\n\nhis friends here. The editor said they were party resolutions, and more, that they\n\nwould pass thisHouse!8Probably some of his friends here had told him so—those very friends who softly told\n\nus here there is no party! Mr.Speaker, I detest this political hypocrisy! Gentlemen tell their organ at Springfield that\n\nthese resolutions are equivalent to instructions to our Senators against the Sub-treasury\n\nbill; but here they sing a totally different tune! Here they say there are no instructions\n\nintended! Mr. H. said he had confidence in one of the banks—the Shawneetownbank; but he had heard rumors of the State bank which, if upon investigation, should turn\n\nout to be true, he should have no confidence in that bank. He had heard that she\n\nhad made $500,000 off the State—that she was also engaged in the lead trade. Mr.BAKERsaid that thegentlemanfromMorgan(Mr. Happy) always introduces the bank into every subject he discusses. But he should\n\nlet that pass. The gentleman had also said that theGlobewas the party organ. Mr.B. would quote from thatorganin 1832. It then condemned the sub-treasury bill, as bringing the money of the nation\n\none step nearer thePresident, &c. The gentleman from Morgan had never quotedthisfrom the Globe. Mr. B. said he did not acknowledge the sentiments of some stray\n\nwriter in the Sangamon Journal as his sentiments. He did not think the resolutions\n\nwere party resolutions.9 Mr. B. then referred to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. It appeared\n\nthat special depositories had been established. He thought the argument of the gentleman\n\nfrom Adams was unanswerable. These special depositories were general depositories\n\nat last. The money is placed to the special credit of the treasurer, and the banks\n\nhave the use of the money until the treasurer wants it. He thought our own banks\n\nought to be placed in the same condition. Mr. B. contended that it was not the amount\n\nof the deposites which should determine this question. Whether the deposites were much or little, the principle is the same. If it is right to deposite at all in banks, and he thought it was, the amount of the deposites is nothing. Mr. B. said the bank which had lately been selected inMobileowed the government from 1837. The Bank of Missouri had only gone into operation\n\nlately. She had always paid specie, he supposed, but the effect of keeping her a\n\ndepository, and not our own, was to cripple our banks and the community in which they\n\nwere. Mr. B. asked whether it was wise legislation in Congress to exclude our banks.\n\nThat the legislation was partial, no one could doubt. Its effect was to draw our\n\nsubstance from us never to return. This was the manner in which we were treated by\n\na government which severed the order of Providence, who returns the dews of Heaven\n\nfor all he takes away. He, Mr. B., said the resolution was not of apartynature. If the government had acted partially, as he thought it had, we ought to\n\nspeak out without regard to party, and have speedy and active redress. Mr.WALKER, ofVermillion, contended that what he wanted was to express the opinion that while the government\n\nused banks, she ought to use ours. But the resolutions, as they now read, would not\n\naccomplish the purpose. ThegentlemanfromSangamohad stated yesterday that the General Government was no longer the protector of the\n\nState, because she did not deposite her money in banks. Mr. Walker did not expect to hear such doctrines advanced on\n\nthis floor. The gentleman seemed to think that we must hurl our defiances in the\n\nteeth of the General Government, as on some foreign enemy. He seemed to scout the\n\nidea that theLegislatureought to memorialize Congress. He called it a humiliation. Mr. Walker thought such\n\ndoctrines as these worse than nullification.10 Gentlemen condemn the Secretary of the Treasury for violating the deposite law in selecting some sixteen deposite banks, and at the same time condemn him for not violating the law still further by\n\nselecting our own banks against the law. This was inconsistent. Mr Walker then referred\n\nto the opinion of the press of these resolutions. The Whig papers had broke party\n\ngrounds upon them, they called them a death-blow to the sub-treasury, and amounting\n\nto an instruction to our Senators to vote against that bill. It was in vain for gentlemen\n\nto say there was no party intended. They had voted down all amendments, they had\n\ngone against all investigation. They had opposed all modification, by which the resolutions\n\ncould be put in such a form as to carry both parties generally. This course falsifies\n\nthe declarations of gentlemen that there is no party. Mr BAKER replied, denying that he was in any sense a nullifier. MrCalhoun, he believed, the great nullifier, was now acting with the party to which thegentlemanfromVermilionbelongs. Mr. HAPPY said he hoped he would not be asked to throw off his party trammels, by\n\ngentlemen who stick so tight to their own. Mr H. asked the gentleman from Sangamo\n\nwhat party it was that voted in favor of the sub-treasury in 1832? Was it not his\n\nownparty? Mr BAKER vindicated hispartyfor their course then, by saying that the ban of the Administration was then upon\n\nthem. MrENGLISHsaid he should vote for the amendment, he believed it was better calculated to attain\n\nthe object desired by every gentleman in this House; he was opposed to the Senate\n\nResolutions, not that he was unfriendly to the object proposed to be accomplished\n\nby them, but that they accused in strong language the Administration with wanton partiality\n\ntowards our banks. MrEsaid he would go as far as any other gentleman to promote the interest of our own\n\nbanks, but that he was unwilling to vote to censure the General Government until he\n\nwas convinced that such partiality had been shown by the government. If gentlemen\n\nbelieved that such partiality existed, why did they oppose the resolution offered\n\nby thegentlemanfromSangamo, MrCalhoun, calling for the correspondence between the Secretary of the Treasury and the banks\n\nof Illinois; are gentlemen afraid to have the facts come to thelight?11Mr E. was friendly to our own institutions, and was anxious to see them made the\n\ndepositories of the public monies collected in our own State while the Government\n\ncontinues to make deposites in banks, which he hoped might not long be the case. Mr E., understood the gentleman\n\nfrom Sangamo (Mr Baker) to say, that any gentleman that would not vote for the resolutions\n\nas they now are, must be so tramelled by party shackles as to be unworthy to represent a free and intelligent people, that\n\nthere is nothing in these resolutions of a party character, that gentlemen ought to\n\nsoar above party considerations on this question. Mr E. replied to this part of the\n\nargument by saying, he should vote for the amendment, and that if the resolutions\n\nwere not amended, he should vote against them notwithstanding the declaration just\n\nmade by the Hon. gentleman from Sangamo. Mr E. said, he was willing to admit that\n\nhe was a party man to a certain extent, and that he did not know a gentleman on this\n\nfloor that was not. Mr. E. said, he thought thecryof no party, came with rather an ill grace from that quarter. Mr E. said if he\n\nwas permitted toguess, he shouldguessthat no gentleman on this floor would hollow louder and throw his hat higher at a\n\nparty victory, than the Hon. gentleman from Sangamo. Mr E. hoped the amendments might\n\nbe agreed to. MrLINCOLNsaid, he would be willing that the wordpartialityshould be stricken out if he thought it was not true. The Legislature would be more\n\nrespected by the Government if it used plain language, whenever that language is true.\n\nMrL. then summed up the arguments which had passed, and contended that the position was\n\nfully made out that the Government had been partial. He was willing to take thegentlemanfromVermilionby the hand. He says that by our course we strike our own party friends. Well,\n\nwe are willing to go it. Let him do the same with his party friends. Gentlemen insist\n\nthat they cannot pass on these resolutions without investigation. He had heard similar\n\narguments often made to put off trial in court. Mr WILLIAMS pointed out the distinction between the resolutions and the substitute.12He believed that the resolutions were true, and he hoped gentlemen would come up\n\nand vote on them. He hoped no newspaper opinions would be taken as authority. Let\n\ngentlemen judge for themselves whether they instruct our Senators against a sub-treasury\n\nor not, and vote accordingly. Mr W. declared that from the documents in his hand,\n\nit was evident that MrWoodburyconsidered it in his power to employ banks. Mr W. said, that he and his friends were willing to modify the resolutions in a manner\n\nwhich he thought would be acceptable. Mr MURPHY hoped the substitute would be withdrawn, as he desired to have the resolutions\n\nmodified as had been suggested. Mr CLOUD did not think he could withdraw it. He could not vote for the seventh resolution,\n\nwhich instructed our Senators to use their influence to deposite the money in the State.13 Mr WALKER, of Vermilion said, he thought as the question would be first taken upon\n\nthe first amendment, a compromise might be made upon the language of the seventh resolution.14 MrMURPHY, ofPerry, made some remarks, which were lost by the reporter. The question was then taken on striking out all after the word resolved in the first\n\nresolution, and decided by yeas and nays as follows: Yeas—Messrs.Alexander,AllenofFranklin,AllenofGreene,Bainbridge,Brown, Calhoun,Carpenter,Churchill, Cloud,Compher,Copland,Crain,Daley,Edmonson, English,Fisk,Flood,Foster,French,Gouge,GreenofClay,GreenofGreene,Hankins, Happy,Harris,Houston,Kercheval,Logan,McWilliams,Maus,Moore,MurphyofCook,Naper, Pace,Robinson,Roman,Robert Smith,ThomasofSt. Clair, Walker of Vermilion,WebbofAlexander,Wood,Zimmerman, and Mr.Speaker—43.

Mr. THORNTON asked whether the resolutions would receive the support of thegentlemanfromSangamonif thus amended. Mr. CALHOUN said they would. The question being taken, the fifth resolution was stricken out.17 Mr. LINCOLN moved to lay the resolutions and amendments on the table until the 4th\n\nof July, which was decided in the affirmative, by yeas and nays as follows: Yeas—Messrs. Alexander, Allen of Franklin, Allen of Greene, Bainbridge, Brown, Carpenter, Churchill,\n\nCloud, Compher, Copland, Crain, Daley, Dubois, English, Ficklin, Fisk, Flood, Foster,\n\nFrench, Gouge, Green of Clay, Green of Greene, Hankins, Happy, Harris, Henderson,\n\nHolmes, Houston, Kercheval, Lincoln, Logan, Lyons, McCormick, McMillan, McWilliams,\n\nMoore, Murphy of Cook, Naper, Read, Robinson, Roman, George Smith, Walker of Vermilion,\n\nWebb of Alexander, Zimmerman, and Mr. Speaker—46.

      "to the opinion of the press of these resolutions. The Whig papers had broke party",
      "grounds upon them, they called them a death-blow to the sub-treasury, and amounting",
      "to an instruction to our Senators to vote against that bill. It was in vain for gentlemen",

      "could be put in such a form as to carry both parties generally. This course falsifies",
      "the declarations of gentlemen that there is no party. Mr BAKER replied, denying that he was in any sense a nullifier.

      "Resolutions, not that he was unfriendly to the object proposed to be accomplished",
      "by them, but that they accused in strong language the Administration with wanton partiality",
      "towards our banks. MrEsaid he would go as far as any other gentleman to promote the interest of our own",
      "banks, but that he was unwilling to vote to censure the General Government until he",
      "was convinced that such partiality had been shown by the government. If gentlemen",
      "believed that such partiality existed, why did they oppose the resolution offered",
      "by thegentlemanfromSangamo, MrCalhoun, calling for the correspondence between the Secretary of the Treasury and the banks",
      "of Illinois; are gentlemen afraid to have the facts come to thelight?11Mr E. was friendly to our own institutions, and was anxious to see them made the",
      "depositories of the public monies collected in our own State while the Government",
      "continues to make deposites in banks, which he hoped might not long be the case. Mr E., understood the gentleman",
      "from Sangamo (Mr Baker) to say, that any gentleman that would not vote for the resolutions",
      "as they now are, must be so tramelled by party shackles as to be unworthy to represent a free and intelligent people, that",
      "there is nothing in these resolutions of a party character, that gentlemen ought to",
      "soar above party considerations on this question. Mr E. replied to this part of the",
      "argument by saying, he should vote for the amendment, and that if the resolutions",
      "were not amended, he should vote against them notwithstanding the declaration just",
      "made by the Hon. gentleman from Sangamo. Mr E. said, he was willing to admit that",
      "he was a party man to a certain extent, and that he did not know a gentleman on this",
      "floor that was not. Mr. E. said, he thought thecryof no party, came with rather an ill grace from that quarter. Mr E. said if he",
      "was permitted toguess, he shouldguessthat no gentleman on this floor would hollow louder and throw his hat higher at a",
      "party victory, than the Hon. gentleman from Sangamo. Mr E. hoped the amendments might",
      "be agreed to. MrLINCOLNsaid, he would be willing that the wordpartialityshould be stricken out if he thought it was not true. The Legislature would be more",
      "respected by the Government if it used plain language, whenever that language is true.",
      "MrL. then summed up the arguments which had passed, and contended that the position was",
      "fully made out that the Government had been partial. He was willing to take thegentlemanfromVermilionby the hand. He says that by our course we strike our own party friends. Well,",
      "we are willing to go it. Let him do the same with his party friends. Gentlemen insist",
      "that they cannot pass on these resolutions without investigation. He had heard similar",
      "arguments often made to put off trial in court. Mr WILLIAMS pointed out the distinction between the resolutions and the substitute.12He believed that the resolutions were true, and he hoped gentlemen would come up",
      "and vote on them. He hoped no newspaper opinions would be taken as authority. Let",
      "gentlemen judge for themselves whether they instruct our Senators against a sub-treasury",
      "or not, and vote accordingly. Mr W. declared that from the documents in his hand,",
      "it was evident that MrWoodburyconsidered it in his power to employ banks. Mr W. said, that he and his friends were willing to modify the resolutions in a manner",
      "which he thought would be acceptable. Mr MURPHY hoped the substitute would be withdrawn, as he desired to have the resolutions",
      "modified as had been suggested. Mr CLOUD did not think he could withdraw it. He could not vote for the seventh resolution,",

        "text": "2William J. Gatewoodintroduced these resolutions in the Senate on December 19, 1838.  Gatewood’s eight\n                  resolutions opposed the federal government’s policy of depositing public money collected\n                  inIllinoisin banks of other states, in preference to banks in which theStatehad an interest.  The state government had a vested interested in two banks: theState Bank of Illinoisand theBank of Illinois.  Thecharterof the State Bank   set aside $100,000 of the bank’s capital stock--out of a total\n                  of $1,500,000--for purchase by the state.  The charter of the Bank of Illinois and\n                  theactextending it stipulated that one-third of the bank’s $300,000 in capital stock was\n                  reserved for purchase by the state.The federal banking system was governed by “An Act to Regulate the Deposites of the\n                  Public Money,” or the Deposit Act for short.  Enacted on June 23, 1836, the Deposit\n                  Act was a compromise plan to create a national banking system in the aftermath ofAndrew Jackson’s veto of the re-charter bill for theSecond Bank of the United Statesand use of select state banks, called “pet banks” by Jackson’s critics,  for federal\n                  deposits. Section one required the secretary of the treasury to select at least one\n                  bank in each state and territory, provided certain conditions were met, including\n                  if the secretary believed the banks so selected were solvent and safe enough to be\n                  repositories of public money.TheTreasury Departmentdid not employ either the State Bank of Illinois or the Bank of Illinois as repositories\n                  of public money, and the federal government had deposited revenue from land sales\n                  in Illinois  in the State Bank of Missouri. Gatewood hoped to correct this situation\n                  with his resolutions.  The Senate passed the resolutions on January 4, 1839.  The\n                  House received the resolutions on January 5.Illinois SenateJournal.  1838. 11th G. A., 1st sess., 90-91, 97, 130, 131, 132, 133; Illinois HouseJournal.  1838. 11th G.

PresidentMartin Van Burencalled for the creation of an independent sub-treasury to replace deposit banking\n                  in his message to a special session on Congress on September 5, 1837--a session called\n                  to address thePanic of 1837.Silas Wrightintroduced the first sub-treasury bill, formally titled “A Bill Imposing Additional\n                  Duties as Depositories, in Certain Cases, on Public Officers,” on September 14, 1837.\n                  This bill passed theSenateon October 4, but theHouse of Representativestabled it on October 14. Wright introduced a second sub-treasury bill, titled “A\n                  Bill to Impose Additional Duties, as Depositaries, upon Certain Public Officers, to\n                  Appoint Receivers General of Public Money, and to Regulate the Safe-Keeping, Transfer,\n                  and Disbursement of the Public Moneys of the United States,” on January 16, 1838.\n                  This bill passed the Senate, but failed in the House. In December 1838, Van Buren\n                  in his annual message to Congress renewed calls for an independent sub-treasury, and\n                  Wright andChurchill C.
