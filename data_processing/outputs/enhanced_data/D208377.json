        "text": "6German immigrants began arriving in St. Clair County soon after its creation in 1790.\n                  Germans began arriving in large numbers in 1831, and continued coming throughout the\n                  1830s and 1840s.  The abortive revolutions of 1848 inGermanyandAustriaprovided impetus for a fresh wave of German immigration into the county, and German\n                  immigration continued at a steady pace until the Civil War.   Germans who became naturalized\n                  citizens occupied important local, county, state and federal offices.Morrison’s “100 more votes” would not have done much to help the Whig cause in St.\n                  Clair County; it was definitely a Democratic Party conclave.  In the presidential\n                  election of 1848, Democratic candidateLewis Cassgarnered 63.3 percent of the vote, Zachary Taylor 34.7 percent, and Free Soil Party\n                  candidateMartin Van Buren2 percent.  The disparity was even more pronounced in the gubernatorial and congressional\n                  races.  In  the contest for governor, Democratic candidateAugustus Frenchreceived 100 percent of the vote; his Whig opponent did not receive a single vote.\n                  Bissell won the congressional seat for District One with 99.7 percent of the vote,\n                  his Whig opponent garnering no votes.History of St. Clair County, Illinois(Philadelphia: Brink, McDonough, 1881), 62-67;  Newton Bateman and Paul Selby,Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of St. Clair County, ed. by A.

        "text": "7Morrison proved extraordinarily prescient in his concern about the impact of nativism\n                  on the Whig Party.  Fuelled by anti-Catholicism and ethnic and class prejudice, nativism\n                  revolved around the opposition of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants to the massive increase\n                  in the number of Irish and German Catholic immigrants flooding into the United States\n                  from the 1830s to the 1860s.  Nativism found political expression in theAmerican Party, and a poor showing by the Whig Party in the 1852 elections and a split over theKansas-Nebraska Actallowed an anti-Nebraska coalition to sweep to victory in the1854 mid-term elections, spelling doom for the Whig Party.Ray Allen Billington, “Nativism,”Dictionary of American History, rev. ed.

In elections for the convention in August 1847, Democrats secured 91\n                  of the 162 seats, giving them a comfortable majority.  Bunsen himself was a Democrat.\n                  Morrison used Bunsen’s action to suggest that the Democrats, not the Whigs, were nativist.Illinois Journal(Springfield), 12 September 1848, 3:2; Arthur Charles Cole, ed.,The Constitutional Debates of 1847, vol. 14 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library, Constitutional Series(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1919), 2:xvi, 951-52; Theodore C.\n                     Pease, ed.,Illinois Election Returns, 1818-1848, vol. 18 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1923), 460."

        "text": "9While stumping in the South for Lewis Cass during the presidential election of 1848,\n                  Douglas delivered a speech in early June inNew Orleanswhere he  affirmed that he would resign his seat in theU.S. Senateif theIllinois General Assemblypassed a resolution instructing him to vote for the Wilmot Proviso.  The Democratic\n                  Party won huge majorities in both houses of the General Assembly in the state elections\n                  of 1848, but many Democrats from the northern part of the state sympathized with theFree Soil Party, and hoped to convince their brethren from the southern part of the state to adopt\n                  the free soil cause.  Disaffected Democrats, together with the Whigs, launched a campaign\n                  to test Douglas’s resolve on the Wilmot Proviso in hopes of unseating him.  In January\n                  1849, the General Assembly adopted a resolution instructing the state’s senators to\n                  use all the means in their disposition to enact legislation for the territories acquired\n                  fromMexico“as shall contain the express declaration, that there shall be neither slavery, nor\n                  involuntary servitude in said territories...”    Douglas dutifully introduced the\n                  resolution in the Senate, where it was tabled.  He did not resign, arguing that the\n                  resolution did not go as far as the Wilmot Proviso, and reasoning that it was his\n                  duty to remain, as his resignation would only result in a freesoiler succeeding him.Illinois Journal(Springfield), 22 June 1848, 2:5; 15 November 1848, 4:1; Robert W.
