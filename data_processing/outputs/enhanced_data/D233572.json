R. King– It is unnecessary for me to state to you the position which old Tazewell has always\n\noccupied in the contests which have come off in this district between the two great\n\nparties and equally unnecessary would it be to remind you that in the internal strifes of our own party that Tazewell has always stood up for theSangamonCandidate. With the whole ground before us is mortifying and irritating to think\n\nabout the first application for office from Tazewell County should meet with opposition\n\nfrom the Citizens ofSpringfield– There are two offices to be disposed of, the citizens of Springfield have supplied\n\nthem for twenty five years, should they not be satisfied?2I have thus far presented the claims of MrKing as the representative of Tazewell County. I now speak of MrKing as a member of thewhig party– Among the whole number of aspirants for office from Sangamon who has occupied the\n\nposition which MrKing has? – Which of them has taken the stump, which of them was competent to do so? It so hap-<Page 2>pens that the applicants from Sangamon are well known here: We have nothing to dispute\n\nin the way of want of integrity or any thing else which would detract from their standing\n\nas Gentlemen. As to the want of Competency of two of them, and as to the fact that\n\nthe other two of them are now wealthy men, there can be no dispute. MrKing has already been presented by his neighbors as a candidate forCongress, he still has their confidence, he is eminently competent to fill either of the Land\n\noffices or any other office in the District at the disposal of the Executive, he is\n\na thorough Whig, and of exemplary habits, not belonging to any society of reformed\n\nDrunkards, eitherWashingtoniansorSons of Temperancybut perfectly abstemious and of all men– Pardon what I have in frankness said upon this subject, but be assured that justice\n\nto Tazewell as well as “looks a head”) should teach your fellow citizens not to be\n\ntoo Greedy– If I have said any thing above in an intemperate manner attribute it to my indignation\n\nat hearing that your fellow citizens are not content with wishing to monopolize the\n\noffices but have very unfairly and wrongfully made charges<Page 3>against MrKing derogatory to his character as a moral man: He is charged with being a Drunkard– I know personally that for a very long time he\n\nhas not used spiritsatin any quantity, his health forbidding it– He is charged with being a Gambler. The answer to this, I can only say that there\n\nis very little of any thing done in this place that I have not some knowledge of,\n\nand that I have not heard of any gambling done here in the last five years either\n\nby MrKing or any one else unless some such gaming as whist &c for oysters &c– As to MrKing’s being anabolitionistI am constrained to say that I he was in favor of theWilmot Provisofor which God forgive him, but I know personally from frequent conversations long\n\nsince that he has always theabolition movements– Your citizens may have confounded the opinions of MrKing with those of his BrotherFranklin, who I believe to be and is reputed to be an abolitionist3",

        "text": "3This letter was part of Abraham Lincoln’s strategy to save King’s nomination for an\n                  appointment.  In December 1848,Philo H. ThompsonwroteLincoln urging him to get King a job with the General Land Office.  From December\n                  1848 to February 1849, Lincoln received several letters urging him to help King secure\n                  a position.  On April 7, 1849, Lincoln wrote aletterto Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewingrecommending King for the job of register.    On April 13, he wrote anotherletterreversing himself, recommending King for the job of receiver.On April 25, LincolnwroteThompson that a “tirade” has erupted over his support for King, with opponents casting\n                  aspersions on King’s moral rectitude.  Lincoln bemoaned that his influence in Washington\n                  had broken down and that King’s prospects for a job had diminished.  Lincoln urged\n                  Thompson to find out the truth about King, and, if the charges proved false, to take\n                  measures to sustain his endorsement of King.  In the meantime, LincolnwroteSecretary Ewing  attempting to head off any charges against King or his other recommendations\n                  for jobs in theDepartment of the Interior.Acting on Lincoln’s request,  Thompson crafted a petition denying the allegations\n                  leveled against King and secured the signatures of prominent Whigs andDemocratsin Tazewell County.  He enclosed the signedpetitionin aletterwritten on May 3.  Between April 30 and May 7, Jones,Samuel R. Baker,John W. Casey, andDavid Markwrote Lincoln attesting to King’s moral character and his fitness for public office.\n                  Lincoln penned anotherletterto Ewing on May 10, again recommending King for the job of register. Lincoln enclosed\n                  these letters, Thompson’sletter, and the signedpetitionin hisletterto Ewing.  In late May, King received the appointment as register  and held the job\n                  until 1853.  Davis received the appointment as receiver.William B. Doolittle to Abraham Lincoln;Robert W.
