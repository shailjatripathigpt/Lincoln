On motion of Mr.TRUMBULLa communication from the Fund Commissioner relative to the amount of the interest\n\ndue on the 1st of January was then read. Mr.Lincolnmoved to strike out the body and amendments of the bill and insert in lieu thereof\n\nanamendmentwhich in substance was that the Governor be authorised to issue bonds for the payment\n\nof the interest, that these be called “interest bonds”—that the taxes accruing onCongresslands as they become taxable be irrevocably set aside and devoted as a fund to the\n\npayment of the interest bonds. Mr. Lincoln went into the reasons which appeared to\n\nhim to render this plan preferable to that of hypothecating the State bonds. By this\n\ncourse we could get along till the next meeting of theLegislature, which was of great importance. To the objection which might be urged that, these\n\ninterest bonds could not be cashed, he replied, that if our other bonds could, much\n\nmore could these which offered a perfect security, a fund being irrevocably set aside\n\nto provide for their redemption. To another objection, that we should be paying compound\n\ninterest he would reply, that the rapid growth and increase of our resources was in\n\nso great a ratio as to outstrip the difficulty; that his object was to do the best\n\nthat could be done in the present emergency; all agreed that the faith of the State\n\nmust be preserved; this plan appeared to him preferable to an hypothecation of bonds,\n\nwhich would have to be redeemed and the interest paid. How this was to be done he\n\ncould not see; therefore he had after turning the matter over in every way devised\n\nthis measure, which would carry us on till the next Legislature. Mr.KITCHELLmoved an amendment to theamendment, proposing that the property of the State on the various works of internal improvement\n\nshould be advertised for sale, giving six weeks public notice, that said articles\n\nshould then be sold for cash and the proceeds if any employed to pay our debts. Mr.\n\nK. went at some length into the support of his amendment; these works he said were\n\ndecaying and perishing the Engineers instruments were being destroyed, the houses\n\nwere falling to decay, the timber rotting. What could be more honourable than selling\n\nour property to pay our debts? Suppose we cannot pay by the 1st of January? will the\n\nheavens fall down? Many persons there were who could not meet their engagements, yet\n\nthey were honorable men. If after selling all these articles, any money was over\n\nafter paying our debts it might be deposited in the public Treasury. Mr.MURPHYofCookwent into an examination of the measure proposed by Mr. Lincoln. He was much struck\n\nwith the plan, but in reference to our immediate exigences it did not appear to him\n\npracticable. Mr. M. then went into details of the two measures, he thought the plan\n\ngood if it could be so modified as to raise the funds required in time to save the\n\ncredit of the State. Mr.PECKdid not rise to discuss the merits of the bill, for he thought there was too much\n\ngood sense in the House that he should feel apprehensive of its passage. Mr P ridiculed\n\nthe idea of selling the follies of a former Legislature to pay the debts it had caused\n\nto be contracted. He urged the necessity of supporting State credit, and explained\n\nof what a sensitive nature it was compared with individual credit. He blamed that\n\nparty zeal which had led to the suspicion that his state would repudiate its loans,\n\nand represented, thatMichigan, which had issued similar bonds, and had been also cheated by corporations, as all\n\nwould be who trusted to them, yet she had maintained her faith inviolate and her bonds\n\nhad maintained a better price than ours. He thought the proposition of thegentlemanfromSangamonobjectionable on the ground that there was not time sufficient. He feared the protraction\n\nof debate until the time to save our credit had gone by Mr LINCOLN followed, and advocated at some length, the measure of his amendment,\n\nurging that it was far less an expedient, and less temporary in its nature, than the\n\nmeasure of the bill. MrGRIDLEYsupported briefly the amendment; and suggested that probably the holders of our\n\nbonds would take these new bonds thus secured for payment in lieu of interest. Mr KITCHELL briefly explained. MrMUNSELLwas not willing to go for expedients: in the last 12 or 14 years our monetary affairs\n\nhad gone on badly: he wished to see the money paid on the 1st of January, if possible,\n\nbut he would not vote for mere expedients. He was prepared with a proposition if\n\nthat of thegentlemanfrom Sangamon should fail. He had done nothing to help to raise this debt, he had\n\nbeen an uncompromising opponent, but now that the State was in debt he was willing\n\nto raise means to pay the principal as well as the interest. MrCAVARLYwould propose to incorporate the plan of Mr Lincoln with that of the Finance Committee,\n\nand not sell, but hypothecate these interest bonds, and by this means create a fund.\n\nHe would agree to create a perpetual fund to pay the bonds hypothecated. Mr KITCHELL’S amendment was then put by thechairand lost without a division. After a brief discussion as to the disposition of the bill, on motion of MrHardin, the committee rose, when, On motion of MrCarpenter, the bill and amendments were referred to the committee on Finance.",
