He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to Henderson and\n                  other political allies seeking support for his candidacy and information about his\n                  prospects. \n                  Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

He wrote that he supported either Lincoln\n                  or Archibald Williams for the United States Senate seat—since they were bothWhigs—but that Lincoln had a slight advantage inStark County, Illinois. When the General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, ten rounds\n                  of voting were needed to finally determineLyman Trumbullas the victor. Henderson cast his vote for Lincoln on nine ballots before switching\n                  to Trumbull on the final ballot. See1854 Federal Election.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G. A., 242-55."
