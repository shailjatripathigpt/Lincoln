Baker, and John J.\n                  Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective Whig congressmen.\n                  Hardin and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed that the 1846 nomination\n                  should have been his. While Hardin delayed officially announcing his candidacy, Lincoln\n                  set out to solidify his own support. In response, Hardin proposed that the convention\n                  system for the nomination be thrown out,  in favor of a primary election. Lincolnrespondedto Hardin’s proposal on January 19.Lincoln and Hardin were vying to represent the Seventh Congressional District, which\n                  included the counties ofCass,Logan,Marshall,Mason,Menard,Morgan,Putnam,Sangamon,Scott,Tazewell, andWoodford.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:218, 231, 233;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 26 February 1846, 2:1-2; Howard W.
