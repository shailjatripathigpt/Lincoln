Basler places these notes as contemporary to thecampaign circularauthored by Lincoln and four other leading Whigs dated January 31, 1840.  Lincoln\n                  and the  others authored this circular in obedience to a resolution passed by theWhig State Convention.Basler claims that Lincoln sent this document to Madison Miller, Whig candidate for\n                  theHouse of RepresentativesfromMonroe County.  The editors did not locate the document in Miller’s Papers at the Missouri Historical\n                  Society, and Basler offers no further collaborative documentation for this contention,\n                  so the editors have been unable to verify this assertion.Roy P.
