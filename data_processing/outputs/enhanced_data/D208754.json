        "text": "3Trumbull is referencing the conflict within theDemocratic Partyover the Lecompton Constitution. During the agitation over whether to admit Kansas\n                  as a free or slave state, pro-slavery Kansans held a constitutional convention inLecomptonfrom September 7 to November 8, 1857, drafting a constitution guaranteeing slaveholders\n                  already in the territory their property rights and leaving the decision whether to\n                  allow new slaves into the territory to voters in a referendum. Voters could vote for\n                  the “constitution with slavery” or the “constitution without slavery,” but were not\n                  offered the opportunity to accept or reject the constitution as a whole. On December\n                  21, 1857, Kansans voting in the referendum on the Lecompton Constitution—free state\n                  Kansans abstained from participating—cast 6,226 votes for Lecompton with slavery and\n                  569 for it without slavery amid charges of voter fraud. On January 4, 1858, however,\n                  Kansans voting in elections called by the anti-slavery legislature—pro-slavery Kansans\n                  abstained from participating—overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution. Despite\n                  opposition in Kansas and considerable backlash fromRepublicansand the anti-slavery faction in the Democratic Party, PresidentJames Buchanansupported the Lecompton Constitution, urging that Kansas be admitted into the Union\n                  under the its terms.Stephen A. Douglasopposed it, however, bringing him into conflict with Buchanan. Buchanan warned Douglas\n                  that he faced political reprisals if he opposed the administration, but Douglas defied\n                  the president, arguing in a speech before theU.S. Senatethat the Lecompton Constitution did not reflect the will of the actual inhabitants\n                  of Kansas, citing the December 21, 1857 vote that allowed voters to vote for the constitution\n                  but not against it. The U.S. Senate approved the Lecompton Constitution, but Republicans,\n                  Democratic allies of Douglas, and others, with Douglas as floor leader of the opposition,\n                  defeated it in theU.S. House of Representatives.
