The object of tbe meeting being stated byAbraham Lincoln,sq. of Springfield,—to be a desire, that the subject of the recentPhiladelphiariots, as connected with, and promoted by thewhig party, should be fairly discussed, and understood by the citizens of thisStateand country.On his motion, the following Preamble and Resolutions were submitted for the action\n\nof the meeting—supporting them by able and forcible arguments: Whereas, There seems to be a determined effort making, by the so calleddemocratic party, to charge the blame of the late riots in Philadelphia, upon the Whigs; and to ascribe\n\nthat blame to a supposed hostility of the Whig party in general toforeigners andCatholics; and,Whereas, truth, and justice to ourselves, demand that we should repel the charge; therefore, Resolved, That in admitting the foreigner to the rights of citizensnip, he should be put to some reasonable test of his fidelity to our country and its\n\ninstitutions; and that he should first dwell among us a reasonable time to become\n\ngenerally acquainted with the nature of those institutions; and that, consistent with\n\nthese requisites, naturalization laws, should be so framed, as to render admission\n\nto citizenship under them, as convenient, cheap, and expeditious as possible. Resolved, That we will now, and at all times, oppose as best we may, all attempts to either\n\ndestroy the naturalization laws or to so alter them, as to render admission under\n\nthem, less convenient, less cheap, or less expeditious than it now is. Resolved, That the guarantee of the rights of conscience, as found in our Constitution, is\n\nmost sacred and inviolable, and one that belongs no less to the Catholic, than to\n\ntheProtestant; and that all attempts to abridge or interfere with these rights, either of Catholic\n\nor Protestant, directly or indirectly, have our decided disapprobation, and shall\n\never have our most effective opposition.
