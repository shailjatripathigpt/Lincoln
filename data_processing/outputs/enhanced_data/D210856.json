        "text": "2Initially, Perley and Potter sent a petition to Abraham Lincoln on July 12, 1858, with the signatures of thirtyDemocratsand fiftyRepublicans, inviting him to visit Henry, Illinois. Lincolnagreedon August 3. The invitation stemmed from Lincoln’s recent nomination at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Lincoln boarded a train at 3 a.m. on August 23 and arrived in Henry, Illinois, toaddressthe town for several hours on his promised date. PerleyintroducedLincoln to a crowd that was several thousand strong.Marshall Countywas a northern Illinois county assumed to be strongly Republican in 1858, and that\n                  proved to be the case in theelection of that year. Marshall was in the Eighth Illinois Senate District, where RepublicanGeorge C. Bestordefeated Democrat William S. Moss, and the Forty-Second Illinois House District,\n                  which elected RepublicanJohn A. McCallover Democrat Washington E. Cook.Allen C.
