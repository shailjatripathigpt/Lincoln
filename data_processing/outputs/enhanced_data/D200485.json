Wick delivered this speech in theU.S. House of Representativeson April 25, 1848 in the midst of a three-day debate on a resolution introduced by\n                  RepresentativeJohn G. Palfrey. The resolution  called for the appointment of a five-person select committee to\n                  investigate pro-slavery riots that rocked the nation’s capital in the aftermath of\n                  thePearlincident and offered their opinion whether legislation was necessary to prevent future\n                  rioting.  On April 15, seventy-six or seventy-seven slaves from Washington, DC attempted\n                  to escape by hiding aboard a schooner named thePearl.  The plan was  to sail down thePotomac Riverinto theChesapeake Bayand up theDelaware Riverto freedom inNew JerseyorPennsylvania. Inclement weather delayed thePearl’svoyage, and on April 17, a posse captured the runaways and returned them to Washington.\n                  This prompted three days of rioting by pro-slavery mobs.Josephine F.
