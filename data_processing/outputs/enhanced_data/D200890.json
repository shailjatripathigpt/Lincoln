Pursuant to much drumming and drilling theblack republicanleaders with the ex-leaders, of dark lanternism hereabouts, got together an assemblage\n\nof some two hundred persons at the court house on Tuesday night. The object was to\n\nratify and glorify the nominations made by fusion atBloomington.2One third of the crowd, at least, weredemocrats, present to witness the gyrations of Messrs. Lincoln, John M. Palmer andRichard Yatesin their attempts to wheedle old party associates into the ranks of black republicanism.\n\nThe latter gentleman was not present. After the claquers3were properly stationed— among these we observed the prominent leaders of Sam’s corps\n\nin this quarter—4Mr. Lincoln opened his speech, and for more than an hour he bored his audience with\n\none of the weakest speeches that he ever perpetrated. He was evidently laboring under\n\nmuch restraint, conscious that he was doling out new doctrine to the oldwhigsabout him, and fearful that in keeping within moderate bounds, he would so filter\n\nhis discourse that it would not in any degree reach the end he desired. He would\n\noccasionally launch out and lead his hearers to think that the most ultraabolitionismwould follow, when, under the old whig eyes we have mentioned, he would soften his\n\nremarks to a supposed palatable texture. In this way, backing and filling, he frittered\n\naway anything of argument that he might have presented, convincing his audience,\n\nhowever, that his niggerism has as dark a hue as that ofGarrisonorFred Douglas, but that his timidity before the peculiar audience he addressed prevented its earnest\n\nadvocacy with the power and ability he is known to possess. The gist of his remarks were intended to show that thedemocratic partyfavors the extension of slavery, that black republicanism aims to prevent it; by\n\nwhat process we did not learn from him, nor did he furnish any evidence of the truth\n\nof his allegation against thedemocracy. He was opposed to the extension of slavery. So are we. But we desire to see it\n\ndone in a constitutional manner— by the act of the people interested.5For leaving the decision of the question there, by the adjustment of ‘50, and by theNebraska act,6black republicanism has raised another furor in the country, and until very lately,\n\nthey have claimed forcongressthe power to refuse the admission of any new state recognizing slavery by its constitution.7Latterly, this plank of their platform has been suppressed. We heard nothing of\n\nit on Tuesday evening from Mr. Lincoln. The same caving in as to the restoration\n\nof theMissouri restriction, marks the latter day policy of the sectional party, and he as cautiously avoided it. They seek power, Mr. Lincoln naively told us, by the agglomeration\n\nof all the discordant elements of faction, and if obtained, the now suppressed platform\n\nof ultra abolitionism will be avowed and acted upon. He boldly avowed, in one of\n\nhis many escapings, that there could be no Union with slavery. That agitatiod would be ceaseless until it shall be swept away, but the mode of its eradication\n\nhe left to inference from his own antecedents and those of the ruling spirits of black-republicanism—\n\nGarrison,Greeley,Seward,Sumner, and others of that genus. To attain power, by whatever means, was the burden of his song, and he pointed to\n\nthe complexion of theBloomingtonticket as evidence of the desire of the factions to attain it by any process. Bissell,\n\na renegade democrat, headed it. Hoffman, a German nondescript, followed;Miller, ex-whig and probableknow-nothing, followed next, whileHatch,DuboisandPowell, avowed know-nothings, brought up the rear. With such a medley— such a fusion of\n\nopposites, none can doubt that the end and aim of theBloomington organizationis “power”— andplace, and that its managers would sink any principle, trample upon right, law and constitution\n\nto attain their object. Mr. Lincoln’s allusion to Bissell’s services as a warrior was singularly malapropos,\n\nin him, at least; Bissell’s laurels having been won in a war, the “identical spot”\n\non which it commenced never could be learned by Mr.L., and consequently had his inveterate opposition during its entire progress, by his\n\ncongressional action in hampering the democratic administration in its prosecution.\n\nIn this connection, Bissell may well exclaim— “Save me from such backing!”8 Except from the quad of claquers we have mentioned, Mr. Lincoln’s remarks were received with coldness. He convinced\n\nnobody of his own sincerity, of the justness of his cause, nor did he elicit any applause\n\nexcept from the drilled few who occupied the front benches.9 John M. Palmer, the renegade ofMacoupin, followed Mr. Lincoln, in the same strain, with a tithe more hyperbole about freedom,\n\nand downtroddenKansas, interlarded with copious abuse ofDouglas, and being newer in the abolition ranks, of course he was more vehement in advocacy\n\nof black-republican doctrine. He never was a sound democrat, and now that he has\n\nthrown off the veil which has covered him for years, he is a most vociferous in his\n\nadvocacy of the heresies that he ever had a penchant for, while he modestly proclaims\n\nthat the democracy, as represented from every congressional district in the Union\n\natCincinnatilast week,10have left him! He declared, and essayed to prove it by documentary evidence, tha the, John M. Palmer, was fixed as therock of Gibraltar, and that the democracy of the nation were bogus democrats, hence for comfort and\n\nprospect of place he condescends to permit the ancient enemies of democracy to act\n\nwith him, for the advancement of democratic principles! Both he and Mr. Lincoln insisted\n\nthat they had not budged an inch from their former positions, though professedly wide\n\nas the poles hitherto, but now standing shoulder to shoulder upon the narrow plank\n\nof sectionalism. Themodus operandiof their conjunction, neither having moved his “spot,” they left to the philosophical\n\ninference of their highly amused audience. The second demonstration of black republicanism at thecapital, like thefirst, showed conclusively that the mass of people hereabouts have no sympathy with the\n\nblack republican movement. Renegade leaders find in the abandonment of principle\n\nthat they have lost their former hold upon the people, who are not to be veered about\n\nat the whim of aspiring demagogues, whose sole object is official position, though\n\nit may be reached by a sacrifice of the peace and best interests of the country, and\n\neven the stability of the Union. Hence the Bissell-Hoffman ratification of Tuesday\n\nnight was a tame, spiritless affair. The wire-workers were already made to see that\n\nthe people are not in their ring.11",

The object was to\n               ratify and glorify the nominations made by  fusion atBloomington.2One third of the crowd, at least, weredemocrats, present to witness the gyrations of Messrs.[Messieurs] Lincoln, John M. Palmer andRichard Yatesin their attempts to wheedle old party associates into the ranks of black republicanism.\n               The latter gentleman was not present.  After the claquers3were properly stationed— among these we observed the prominent leaders of Sam’s corps\n               in this quarter—4Mr. Lincoln opened his speech, and for more than an hour he bored his audience with\n               one of the weakest speeches that he ever perpetrated.  He was evidently laboring under\n               much restraint, conscious that he was doling out new doctrine to the oldwhigsabout him, and fearful that in keeping within moderate bounds, he would so filter\n               his discourse that it would not in any degree reach the end he desired.  He would\n               occasionally launch out and lead his hearers to think that the most ultraabolitionismwould follow, when, under the old whig eyes we have mentioned, he would soften his\n               remarks to a supposed palatable texture.  In this way, backing and filling, he frittered\n               away anything of argument that he might have presented, convincing his audience, \n               however, that his niggerism has as dark a hue as that ofGarrisonorFred Douglas, but that his timidity before the peculiar audience he addressed prevented its earnest\n               advocacy with the power and ability he is known to possess."

He was opposed to the extension of slavery.  So are we.  But we desire to see it\n               done in a constitutional manner— by the act of the people interested.5For leaving the decision of the question there, by the adjustment of ‘50, and by theNebraska act,6black republicanism has raised another furor in the country, and until very lately,\n               they have claimed forcongressthe power to refuse the admission of any new state recognizing slavery by its constitution.7Latterly, this plank of their platform has been suppressed.  We heard nothing of\n               it on Tuesday evening from Mr. Lincoln.  The same caving in as to the restoration\n               of theMissouri restriction, marks the latter day policy of the sectional party, and he as[has] cautiously avoided it.  They seek power, Mr. Lincoln naively told us, by the agglomeration\n               of all the discordant elements of faction, and if obtained, the now suppressed platform\n               of ultra abolitionism will be avowed and acted upon.  He boldly avowed, in one of\n               his many escapings, that there could be no Union with slavery.  That agitatiod[agitation] would be ceaseless until it shall be swept away, but the mode of its eradication\n               he left to inference from his own antecedents and those of the ruling spirits of black-republicanism—\n               Garrison,Greeley,Seward,Sumner, and others of that genus."

Bissell,\n               a renegade democrat, headed it.  Hoffman, a German nondescript, followed;Miller, ex-whig and probableknow-nothing, followed next, whileHatch,DuboisandPowell, avowed know-nothings, brought up the rear.  With such a medley— such a fusion of\n               opposites, none can doubt that the end and aim of theBloomington organizationis “power”— andplace, and that its managers would sink any principle, trample upon right, law and constitution\n               to attain their object."

He never was a sound democrat, and now that he has\n               thrown off the veil which has covered him for years, he is a most vociferous in his\n               advocacy of the heresies that he ever had a penchant for, while he modestly proclaims\n               that the democracy, as represented from every congressional district in the Union\n               atCincinnatilast week,10have left him! He declared, and essayed to prove it by documentary evidence, tha  the, John M.

Both he and Mr. Lincoln insisted\n               that they had not budged an inch from their former positions, though professedly wide\n               as the poles hitherto, but now standing shoulder to shoulder upon the narrow plank\n               of sectionalism.
