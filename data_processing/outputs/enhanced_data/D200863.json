However, a September 19letterLincoln wrote Joy reveals that Joy indeed replied and that Lincoln also sent Joy\n                  a telegram on September 17, also on the topic of compensation. Lincoln’s September\n                  17 telegram to Joy has not been located.Mason BraymanhadhiredLincoln on behalf of the Illinois Central Railroad Company in October 1853. Lincoln\n                  represented the railroad in the caseIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parkeas well as in other cases that local landowners brought against the railroad as it\n                  completed its construction work throughout centralIllinois. At the request of Brayman, Lincoln had declined new cases against the railroad that\n                  came his way between 1853 and 1855, passing at least some on toJohn T. Stuart, and therefore lost opportunities to earn legal fees as a direct result of his employment\n                  for the railroad. Lincoln corresponded with Joy about some of his work on behalf of\n                  the railroad on at least two occasions prior to this September 14 letter.Lincoln only requests compensation for his services “since last September” in this\n                  letter because on September 23, 1854, hewroteBrayman requesting that Brayman honor a $100 draft upon the railroad’s account for\n                  services Lincoln had rendered on behalf of the railroad since the time Brayman hired\n                  him. Lincoln’s September 19, 1855letterto Joy reveals that Brayman approved this 1854 request for compensation.Lincoln eventually also received $5,000 for his legal services related specifically\n                  to the caseIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parke, although he had to sue the railroad in 1857 to collect the fee.Abraham Lincoln to James F. Joy;Abraham Lincoln to James F. Joy;Illinois Central RR v.
