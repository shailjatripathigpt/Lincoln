        "text": "1Charles H. Ray wrote and signed this  undated letter, including Abraham Lincoln’s\n                  name and the address on the envelope.The editors conjectured the date from the letter’s content and Lincoln’s delivery\n                  address.  Ray is writing Lincoln during theLincoln-Douglas Debates.    Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate fromIllinoisforU.S. Senatein 1858. In the summer and fall of that year, Lincoln and hisDemocraticopponent, the incumbentStephen A. Douglas, held a series of seven debates throughout the state. During the first debate inOttawa, Illinois, on August 21, Douglas challenged Lincoln to answer a series of questions, including\n                  if Lincoln would vote to abolish slavery in theDistrict of Columbiaif elected.  On August 23, Lincoln wroteEbenezer PeckandNorman B. Juddasking them to meet him inFreeport, Illinois, the site of the second debate, to discuss how to cope with Douglas’s tactics introduced\n                  at Ottawa.  The fact that Ray wrote this letter in response to Douglas’s questions\n                  at Ottawa and addressed it to Lincoln at Freeport suggests that he intended for Lincoln\n                  to consider these talking points ahead of the second debate at Freeport on August\n                  27.

        "text": "2The issues of slavery and its national expansion became focal points of the Senate\n                  race. During the  first debate at Ottawa, Douglas erroneously accused Lincoln of helping\n                  to write a platform that called for abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia\n                  at the 1854 Anti-Nebraska convention inSpringfield, Illinois. In truth, this resolution originated as part of a convention platform adopted atAurora, Illinois. No such resolution appeared in the platform adopted at the state convention in Springfield.\n                  Lincoln took no part in either convention. Still, Douglas questioned whether Lincoln\n                  “stands to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:489-90; First Debate with Stephen A.

        "text": "3Douglas regularly championed the principle of popular sovereignty, whereby the people\n                  of a territory could vote on whether to legalize slavery. This principle seemingly\n                  conflicted with theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Dred Scott case. The court’s majority opinion held that neither\n                  theU.S. Congressnor territorial legislatures had any authority to outlaw slavery in U.S. territories.\n                  Ray’s suggested reply to Douglas’s questions about slavery in District of Columbia\n                  seizes on this contradiction. It  attempts to position Lincoln as a “Real Popular\n                  Sovereignty man” who would vote on abolishing slavery in the federal capital according\n                  to the wishes of the citizens of the district.While Lincoln answered Douglas’s earlier question about slavery in the District of\n                  Columbia during his speech at Freeport, he made no use of Ray’s suggested “Real Popular\n                  Sovereignty” rhetoric. Instead, Lincoln indicated that while he personally favored\n                  abolishing slavery in the district, he would only vote for it if three conditions\n                  were met: that the abolition be gradual; that a majority of voters approve it; and\n                  that “unwilling owners” be compensated for the loss of enslaved persons. Lincoln did,\n                  however, take an opportunity to question Douglas’s commitment to popular sovereignty.\n                  He posed  four questions concerning the admission ofKansasto the Union and the expansion of slavery. In his second question, Lincoln asked\n                  Douglas whether the people of a territory could, in light of the Dred Scott decision,\n                  “exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution?”\n                  Douglas responded by establishing what became called his “Freeport Doctrine.” Douglas\n                  answered yes, citizens could exclude slavery by local legislation. “Slavery cannot\n                  exist a day or an hour anywhere,” Douglas famously retorted, “unless it is supported\n                  by local police regulations, furnishing remedies and means of enforcing the right\n                  to hold slaves.” Douglas’s Freeport Doctrine  resolved the inconsistency between popular\n                  sovereignty and the Dred Scott decision on a practical level, thereby satisfying his\n                  Illinois supporters, assuring his reelection to the Senate, but denting his chances\n                  in the American South in thepresidential election of 1860.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:500-9;Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857); Frank L. Dennis,The Lincoln-Douglas Debates(New York: Mason & Lipscomb, 1974), 84-85; Paul M.
