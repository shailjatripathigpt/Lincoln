        "text": "2Washburne andJesse O. Nortonwrote Zebina Eastman, editor of theFree West, to induce him to cease his open hostility to Abraham Lincoln’s candidacy for theU.S. Senate. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of the Missouri Compromise reawakened Lincoln’s passion\n                  for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate. See the1854 Federal Election.Eastman opposed Lincoln as too moderate on the slavery question, preferringOwen Lovejoy,Ichabod Codding,William H. Bissell, orRichard Yates. Eastman went so far as to label Lincoln aKnow-Nothing.Eastman resisted the entreaties from Washburne and Norton, butWilliam H. Herndonconvinced him that Lincoln was sufficiently anti-slavery to garner his support.The Free West(Chicago, IL), 30 November 1854, 2:4; 14 December 1854, 2:2-3, 4-5; David Herbert\n                     Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:394-95; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

        "text": "3No letter from Lincoln to Washburne detailing Lincoln’s views has been found. However,\n                  in a speech inPeoriaon October 16, 1854, Lincoln had divulged his opinions on slavery. Regarding the\n                  restoration of the Missouri Compromise, he said, “Repeal the Missouri compromise—\n                  repeal all compromises— repeal the declaration of independence— repeal all past history,\n                  you still can not repeal human nature. It still will be the abundance of man's heart,\n                  that slavery extension is wrong; and out of the abundance of his heart, his mouth\n                  will continue to speak.” In reference to individuals owning enslaved persons, Lincoln\n                  noted, “When they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge them, not\n                  grudgingly, but fully, and fairly; and I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming\n                  of their fugitives, which should not, in its stringency, be more likely to carry a\n                  free man into slavery, than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.”\n                  He also opined about the admission of slave states into the union, “I meant not to\n                  ask a repeal, or modification of the fugitive slave  law. I meant not to ask for the\n                  abolition of slavery in theDistrict of Columbia. I meant not to resist the admission ofUtahandNew Mexico, even should they ask to come in as slave States. I meant nothing about additional\n                  territories, because, as I understood, we then had no territory whose character as\n                  to slavery was not already settled. As toNebraska, I regarded its character as being fixed, by the Missouri compromise, for thirty\n                  years— as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in Illinois. As to new acquisitions\n                  I said ‘sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.’— When we make new acquaintances,\n                  we will, as heretofore, try to manage them some how. That is my answer.”A month after Washburne wrote this letter to Lincoln,  Nortonwroteurging Lincoln to tweak his positions in order to more fully appeal to Free Soilers.\n                  He counseled, “But it seems to me that, you might, by some concessions, such as could\n                  be made by you without any sacrifice of principle, bring the whole free soil element\n                  to your support. I speak of those who have hitherto been distinctive 'Free Soilers'.\n                  Are you bound to stand byevery thingin the Compromise measures of 1850? Could'nt you concede to them a modification of\n                  the Fugitive Slave act? With this & such positions as you can assume in relation to\n                  the prohibition of Slavery in the Territories & the admission of additional Slave\n                  states, I cannot see why these men cannot unite upon you to a man.”"

After the ninth vote, with his share\n                  of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his remaining supporters\n                  to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected.
