        "text": "3Owen Lovejoy was up for reelection in1858for his seat in theU.S. House of Representatives. Some conservative Republicans, disgruntled with Lovejoy’sabolitionismand encouraged by the recent rift thatStephen A. Douglas’ criticism of PresidentJames Buchanan’s support for theLecompton Constitutioncaused in the Democratic Party,  sought a third candidate to unseat Lovejoy. Some\n                  of Lincoln’s friends—includingT. Lyle Dickey,Ward Hill Lamon, andLeonard Swett—supported this scheme, hoping to capitalize on the votes of both conservative Republicans\n                  and pro-Douglas Democrats. Lincoln argued that support for an independent candidate\n                  would only aid the Democratic Party.In the end, Lovejoy won reelection, defeatinganti-LecomptonGeorge W. Armstrong as well as  Buchanan Democrat David Leroy with 57.7 percent of\n                  the vote to Armstrong’s 38.8 percent and Leroy’s 3.4 percent. Dickey subsequently\n                  left the Republican Party and became a Democrat; other conservative Republicans were\n                  similarly disaffected.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-46, 456-57; Howard W.\n                     Allen and Vincent A.
