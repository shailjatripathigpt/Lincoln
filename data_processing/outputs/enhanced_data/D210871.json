        "text": "2Stark is discussing her divorce case,Stark v. Stark. After her husband, LaFayette A. Stark, deserted her in 1856, she relocated toChampaign County, Illinois, with their son while LaFayette remained inNew York. She retained Lincoln as her attorney and sued her husband for a divorce. Lincoln\n                  argued that LaFayette’s cruelty provided the grounds for divorce and that his harsh\n                  treatment had seriously and negatively impacted Emma’s health. In September 1858,\n                  theLogan County Circuit Courtgranted her the divorce and awarded her full custody of their son.At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running againstDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglasas theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. Like Douglas, Lincoln traveled extensively throughout the campaign of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, so  the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the race for the U.S. Senate. It appears that\n                  Lincoln only visited Atlanta, Illinois, once during the 1858 campaign season. He attended\n                  one of Douglas’ speeches in Atlanta  on July 17, but did not deliver an address himself.Ultimately, in Illinois’ local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.\n                  See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Stark v.
