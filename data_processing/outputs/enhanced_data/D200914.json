    "full_text": "Summary of Speech at Jacksonville, Illinois, 6 September 18561 The meeting was addressed during the afternoon by Hon.Abe Lincoln, in a speech which occupied some two hours. We reached the ground soon after he\n\ncommenced speaking, and found him discussing the subject ofKansas affairs.2— He referred to the principle of theKansas law; it permitted the people to settle the question of slavery for themselves, yet theterritorial legislature, elected by aMissouriconstituency, had passed, together with good wholesome laws, a law in direct conflict\n\nwith this principle, making it a penal offense to declare that slavery was not legal\n\ninKansas, or that Kansas should become a free State, and punishing the individual so offending\n\nby attaching to his leg a chain and ball.3He omitted, however, to inform the audience that this very law was annulled by the\n\nKansas bill which recently passed thedemocraticU.S. Senate; that everyblack republicanin the Senate voted against thus annulling this obnoxious law; that the black republicans\n\nin theHousealso refused to pass the bill which annulledlaw; and that, therefore, the black republicans are alone responsible for theexistence of such a law in Kansas.4In connection with the charge that the legislature of Kansas was elected by a Missouri\n\nconstituency, he overlooked the fact that the evidence adduced by the investigations\n\nupon this subject, embraced in the several reports, goes to prove that if every Missouri\n\nvote had been thrown out, (and they were thrown out at some of the precincts, and\n\nnew elections had,) it would not have changed the majority in the body, nor changed\n\nthe character of its legislation.5The law above referred to by Mr. Lincoln, has been denounced by the most prominent\n\ndemocrats of the country, and by the more prominent of the democratic press. Thedemocracyhave proven the sincerity of their disapprobation of this obnoxious law by voting\n\nfor its repeal, while the black republicans have voted against its repeal, and thus\n\ncontinued it on the statute book. Who, then, are the friends of this law, the democracy,\n\nor Mr. Lincoln and hisparty?6 After quoting an article from theRichmond Enquirerto prove that the democracy, to be consistent, should indorse slavery as morally right, that the constitution would afford no protection to slavery\n\nin the States unless this ground was assumed— he proceeded to state the gist of the\n\nissue in thepresent canvass.7That issue was the intervention ofcongressto prohibit the extension of slavery— shall slavery be extended, or shall its extension\n\nbe prohibited by a law of congress. To render Mr. Lincoln’s position more fully understood\n\nit should be stated thus:— shall the people of each territory be permitted to decide\n\nthe question of slavery for themselves, in accordance with thecompromise of 1850, and theKansas-Nebraska law, or shall the extension of slavery be prohibited by a sectional majority in congress.\n\nThis is the true meaning of the statement of the issue made by Mr. Lincoln. The free\n\nStates comprise a large majority of the nation; Mr. Lincoln and the black republican\n\nparty seek to unite the numerical strength of the north on this sectional question,\n\nand thus, by a majority vote in congress, nullify the popular sovereignty principle\n\nof the compromise of 1850, and the Kansas organic law.8 Without advancing any constitutional arguments to prove the power of congress to prohibit\n\nslavery in the territories, Mr. Lincoln assumed that it should be prohibited by congress,\n\nand should not be left discretionary with the people of the territory, who, he imagined,\n\nwere incompetent to prevent its introduction even if so disposed; that if once introduced\n\nit would be harder to eradicate than to keep out at the start. He referred to the\n\noriginal introduction of slavery into the colonies by themother country, and stated that the new territories occupy now exactly the same relation to the\n\nStates of the Union that the colonies did to the mother country then; thatEnglandhas been censured for permitting the introduction of slavery into the colonies then,\n\nand the States of the Union will hereafter be censured for suffering its introduction\n\n(by the will of the people of the territories themselves) into the new territories\n\nnow. He also read an extract from a speech made byHenry Clayin reference to the territories acquired fromMexico, in which Mr. Clay expressed himself as opposed to legislating slavery into those\n\nterritories, but Mr. Lincoln forgot to inform the audience that Mr. Clay was also\n\nopposed toprohibitingslavery in the territories; that the distinguishedsage of Ashlandwas one of the leaders that established the doctrine of non-intervention by congress\n\nin reference to those very territories— the very principle Mr. Lincoln and hispartyare now assailing.9Mr. Clay and Mr.Websterinformed the country, in their speeches upon this subject, that they advocated the\n\nadjustment of the question of slavery in the territories upon this principle, becaue the doctrine of leaving the question with the people of the territories was a right\n\nprinciple, and because they believed it to be the only means of preserving the Union.\n\nWe have then the high authority of Mr. Clay and Mr. Webster to strengthen the inference\n\nthat, in assailing the principle of non-intervention, Mr. Lincoln and thewoolly partyare working to endanger if not dissolve the Union.10 We think the assertion made by Mr. Lincoln, that the Territories occupy the same relative\n\nposition to the States as did the Colonies to the mother country, an unfortunate one\n\nfor himself, his principles and his party. If this parallel be a true one, then do\n\nthe black republicans seek to enforce the very doctrines which caused theAmerican revolutionand a separation from the mother country? The mother country imposed upon the colonies\n\nlocal laws against their consent, and denied them the privilege of regulating their\n\nown domestic affairs— hence therevolution. The black republicans would impose upon the people of the territories a law in\n\nreference to their local affairs whether they (the people of the territories) desire\n\nit or not, thus imitating the tyranny of the mother country, and denying the great\n\nprinciple of self government. If the relations of the territories to the States be\n\nparallel to those which existed between the colonies and the mother country, then\n\nthe people of the territories have the right to resist, even by revolution, the imposition\n\nof such a law— as did the people of the colonies. If Mr. Lincoln denies the right\n\nof the people of the territories to so resist, then he condemns the act of the American\n\nrevolution, and sustains the tyranny ofGeorge the Thirdagainst our revolutionary sires. England introduced slavery into the colonies against the wishes of the people of the\n\ncolonies. England may therefore justly be censured for the evil she has imposed.\n\nThe doctrine of non-intervention does not legislate slavery, nor necessarily introduce\n\nit, into the territories. If the people of the territories themselves introduce and\n\nestablish slavery; they alone are responsible for the evil— not the States of the\n\nUnion. Mr. Lincoln then definedFremont’s position. He was in favor of congressional intervention, as warranted both by\n\nthe constitution and expediency. He (Lincoln) would go for Fremont on that account—\n\nwould go for the woolly horse itself, if necessary to secure congressional prohibition\n\nof slavery in the territories. (Meaning the woolly horse which Fremont certified\n\nhad been taken by him in theRocky Mountains, and with which, on the faith of Fremont’s certificate,Barnumhumbugged the public)11He referred to the charge that the black republicans were a sectional party: he presumed\n\nthis charge was based upon the fact that the republican candidates were from the free\n\nStates; that if this made them a sectional party, so was the democratic party a sectional\n\nparty— thepresent executiveandvice-presidentwere both citizens of the north. He denied that the black republicans were a sectional\n\nparty, althoughhe admitted they expected to elect their ticket by the exclusive votes of the free\n\nStates:and charged, as an offset, that the democrats rested their hopes for the success\n\nofBuchananon the southern States alone.12 The attempt of Mr. Lincoln to evade the conclusion that the black republicans are\n\na sectional party, by referring to the fact that Mr.Pierceis also a northern man, is a dodge we have seen attempted by some of the country\n\nfusion papers, but were surprised to see such a weak and silly subterfuge advanced\n\nto an intelligent audience by a gentleman of ability and standing like Mr. Lincoln. It is well known that Mr. Pierce was nominated by anational convention, composed of delegates from every State in the Union, that thus he was the candidate\n\nof a national party, and as such he has been sustained in his administration by all\n\nsections of the country. Mr. Buchanan was nominated in the same way. He is thus\n\na national candidate. Fremont was nominated bya conventioncomposed only of delegates from the northern States. He has no party, no supporters,\n\nin one half of the Union; therefore he is a sectional candidate of a sectional party.\n\nThe flattering illusion that Buchanan does not expect a support in the free States,\n\nwill be disipated in a few weeks, if such an illusion really exists in the mind of Mr. Lincoln.13 Towards the close of the speech the distinguished speaker referred to the charge that\n\nthe principles and issue of the black republican party tended to a dissolution of\n\nthe Union. He denied that it was so— asked who was going to dissolve the Union.\n\nThe black republicans would not do it in the event of success; they would then be\n\nin the majority; would have the power; would have thearmy, thenavyand thetreasuryunder their control, and could compel obedience to the laws enacted. A majority\n\nwould never want to dissolve the Union. Then it would be done, if done at all, by\n\nthe minority— by the south. In that event the minority would alone be responsible—\n\nnot the black republican party. When this same question of congressional prohibition of slavery in the territories\n\nwas agitated in congress in 1850, threatening to cause a disruption of the government,\n\nthe North constituted, as now, the majority. Mr.Fillmore, a northern man, occupied the executive chair; they had a northern majority in congress,\n\nand through the executive and that majority held the power; they had the army, the\n\nnavy, and the treasury under their control; yet they did not undertake to subdue the\n\nSouth to submission on this question of intervention.— Mr. Webster, a northern man,\n\nand the acknowledged leader of thewhig partyin the north, did not press an act of prohibition upon the South, and say to them,\n\na majority has done this; if you refuse to submit, upon you alone will rest the responsibility\n\nof disunion. Mr. Webster acknowledged the minority rights of the South, and he appreciated\n\ntoo highly the inestimable value of the Union to endanger it by infringing upon those\n\nrights. His capacious mind grasped the great principle of popular sovereignty as\n\nthe only safe and just rule for the adjustment of the question. That adjustment was\n\nmade and sanctioned by the country. Mr. Lincoln tells us that the black republican\n\nparty are striving to unite the votes of the north on Fremont for the express purpose\n\nof annulling that adjustment principle— to secure by the majority of northern votes\n\na prohibition of slavery in the territories by congress. If, as Mr. Webster foresaw,\n\ndisunion follow the act, the South are to bear the responsibility of resisting the\n\nmajority; the black republicans will be no disunionists; they will have merely introduced\n\na civil war, in which they will have the army, navy and treasury to back them. Mr. Lincoln referred briefly to Mr. Fillmore. He considered that Fillmore stood upon\n\nthe same platform with Buchanan. Scolded atDouglasfor opening the door, (permitting the people of the territory to decide the question\n\nfor themselves,) but refusing to shut it; there could be no middle ground on this\n\nquestion; there could be no third party. Mr. Fillmore had taken position with Buchanan\n\n(and he might have added with Clay and Webster,) in favor of non-intervention. He\n\ncould not go for Fillmore for another reason. He (Lincoln) did not like theKnow Nothings. They were, however, an ephemeral party, and would soon pass away.14 He closed by giving a glowing and prophetic picture of the exultation and joy that\n\nwould animate the country should Buchanan be elected. Rockets would go up in all\n\ndirections; guns would be fired, and a general shout would go up all over the country.\n\nCould a stranger witness these rejoicings from the region of the clouds, he would\n\nnaturally imagine that new era of freedom had dawned upon the country, but, said Mr.\n\nL., it would only be the extension of slavery; and he urged upon his friends to prevent,\n\nif possible, these rejoicings, which seemed to loom prophetically upon his mental\n\nvision. He then made a far-fetched appeal to the democrats, as the longtime advocates\n\nof individual liberty as against the whig party, to support Fremont— after which he\n\nleft the stand. We must say that we regard Mr. Lincoln as a fine speaker. He is certainly the ablest\n\nblack republican that has taken the stump at thisplaceduring the canvass; yet he utterly failed to sustain by satisfactory arguments the\n\nblack republican issue of intervention. We have given the leading points of his speech.\n\nIn the evening a small crowd, the tail end of the meeting, was addressed by Mr.Knapp, ofWinchester. We did not attend.",

We reached the ground soon after he\n               commenced speaking, and found him discussing the subject ofKansas affairs.2— He referred to the principle of theKansas law; it permitted the people to settle the question of slavery for themselves, yet theterritorial legislature, elected by aMissouriconstituency, had passed, together with good wholesome laws, a law in direct conflict\n               with this principle, making it a penal offense to declare that slavery was not legal\n               inKansas, or that Kansas should become a free State, and punishing the individual so offending\n               by attaching to his leg a chain and ball.3He omitted, however, to inform the audience that this very law was annulled by the\n               Kansas bill which recently passed thedemocraticU.S. Senate; that everyblack republicanin the Senate voted against thus annulling this obnoxious law; that the black republicans\n               in theHousealso refused to pass the bill which annulled[the]law; and that, therefore, the black republicans are alone responsible for the[present]existence of such a law in Kansas.4In connection with the charge that the legislature of Kansas was elected by a Missouri\n               constituency, he overlooked the fact that the evidence adduced by the investigations\n               upon this subject, embraced in the several reports, goes to prove that if every Missouri\n               vote had been thrown out, (and they were thrown out at some of the precincts, and\n               new elections had,) it would not have changed the majority in the body, nor changed\n               the character of its legislation.5The law above referred to by Mr. Lincoln, has been denounced by the most prominent\n               democrats of the country, and by the more prominent of the democratic press. Thedemocracyhave proven the sincerity of their disapprobation of this obnoxious law by voting\n               for its repeal, while the black republicans have voted against its repeal, and thus\n               continued it on the statute book.  Who, then, are the friends of this law, the democracy,\n               or Mr. Lincoln and hisparty?6"

To render Mr. Lincoln’s position more fully understood\n               it should be stated thus:— shall the people  of each territory be permitted to decide\n               the question of slavery for themselves, in accordance with thecompromise of 1850, and theKansas-Nebraska law, or shall the extension of slavery be prohibited by a sectional majority in congress.\n               This is the true meaning of the statement of the issue made by Mr. Lincoln.  The free\n               States comprise a large majority of the nation; Mr. Lincoln and the black republican\n               party seek to unite the numerical strength of the north on this sectional question,\n               and thus, by a majority vote in congress, nullify the popular sovereignty principle\n               of the compromise of 1850, and the Kansas organic law.8"

He referred to the\n               original introduction of slavery into the colonies by themother country, and stated that the new territories occupy now exactly the same relation to the\n               States of the Union that the colonies did to the mother country then; thatEnglandhas been censured for permitting the introduction of slavery into the colonies then,\n               and the States of the Union will hereafter be censured for suffering its introduction\n               (by the will of the people of the territories themselves) into the new territories\n               now.  He also read an extract from a speech made byHenry Clayin reference to the territories acquired fromMexico, in which Mr. Clay expressed himself as opposed to legislating slavery into those\n               territories, but Mr. Lincoln forgot to inform the audience that Mr. Clay was also\n               opposed toprohibitingslavery in the territories;  that the distinguishedsage of Ashlandwas one of the leaders that established the doctrine of non-intervention by congress\n               in reference to those very territories— the very principle Mr. Lincoln and hispartyare now assailing.9Mr. Clay and Mr.Websterinformed the country, in their speeches upon this subject, that they advocated the\n               adjustment of the question of slavery in the territories upon this principle, becau[s]e the doctrine of leaving the question with the people of the territories was a right\n               principle, and because they believed it to be the only means of preserving the Union.\n               We have then the high authority of Mr. Clay and Mr. Webster to strengthen the inference\n               that, in assailing the principle of non-intervention, Mr. Lincoln and thewoolly partyare working to endanger if not dissolve the Union.10"

If this parallel be a true one, then do\n               the black republicans seek to enforce the very doctrines which caused theAmerican revolutionand a separation from the mother country?  The mother country imposed upon the colonies\n               local laws against their consent, and denied them the privilege of regulating their\n               own domestic affairs— hence therevolution.  The black republicans would impose upon the people of the territories a law in\n               reference to their local affairs whether they (the people of the territories) desire\n               it or not, thus imitating the tyranny of the mother country, and denying the great\n               principle of self government.  If the relations of the territories to the States be\n               parallel to those which existed between the colonies and the mother country, then\n               the people of the territories have the right to resist, even by revolution, the imposition\n               of such a law— as did the people of the colonies.  If Mr. Lincoln denies the right\n               of the people of the territories to so resist, then he condemns the act of the American\n               revolution, and sustains the tyranny ofGeorge the Thirdagainst our revolutionary sires."

Mr.Fillmore, a northern man, occupied the executive chair; they had a northern majority in congress,\n               and through the executive and that majority held the power; they had the army, the\n               navy, and the treasury under their control; yet they did not undertake to subdue the\n               South to submission on this question of intervention.— Mr. Webster, a northern man,\n               and the acknowledged leader of thewhig partyin the north, did not press an act of prohibition upon the South, and say to them,\n               a majority has done this; if you refuse to submit, upon you alone will rest the responsibility\n               of disunion.

His capacious mind grasped the great principle of popular sovereignty as\n               the only safe and just rule for the adjustment of the question.  That adjustment was\n               made and sanctioned by the country.  Mr. Lincoln tells us that the black republican\n               party are striving to unite the votes of the north on Fremont for the express purpose\n               of annulling that adjustment principle— to secure by the majority of northern votes\n               a prohibition of slavery in the territories by congress.
