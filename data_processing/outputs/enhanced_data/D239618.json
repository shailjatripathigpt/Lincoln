Halsey. Copes, who had custody of one of Halsey’s orphans,\n                  wanted to know the status of the title to this land, and specifically whether Halsey’s\n                  children were entitled to any of the land. Lincoln replied to Copes’ letter on April\n                  16, noting that he had examined public land sales records to no avail but would continue\n                  investigating the matter and write Copes again.Letter, Document ID: 130391,Copes asked Lincoln to search title to land, Martha L.
