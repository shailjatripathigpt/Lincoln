Lincoln sought to take advantage\n                  of an offer Campbell had first made during theelection of 1856to defray the expense of Lincoln’s political campaigning. Lincoln had been named\n                  the Republican Party’s candidate forU.S. Senateat the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionon June 16, 1858, and was anticipating the need for funds to campaign againstStephen A.

Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of centralIllinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.The more northern counties of Illinois were assumed to be safely Republican in the\n                  election of 1858, and that proved to be the case in Campbell’s home county ofLa Salle. Campbell himself had earlier been a Whig, and following the dissolution of that\n                  party eventually became a Republican and supporter of Lincoln. The Forty-Third Illinois\n                  House of Representatives District, which was composed ofGrundy, La Salle, andLivingstoncounties, had two open seats in the election of 1858. Campbell andRichardson S. Hickwere nominated as the Republican candidates for the district on August 26, 1858,\n                  and they defeatedDemocraticcandidates Samuel C. Collins and William Cogswell in all three counties to win the\n                  seats. La Salle County was in the Seventh Illinois Senate District, where RepublicanBurton C. Cookheld over in the 1858 election.Allen C.
