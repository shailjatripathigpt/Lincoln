Lamon’sletterto Lincoln of June 9, 1858 conveyed the results of the recent Republican county conventions\n                  of McLean andLaSallecounties, held respectively on June 5 inBloomingtonand on June 9 inOttawa. These two counties were among those in the Third Congressional District ofIllinois, where Owen Lovejoy was up for reelection to theU.S. House of Representativesin theelection of 1858. Some of the more conservative Republicans of the district, Lamon among them, sought\n                  to replace Lovejoy, whom they labeled an abolitionist.In May of 1858 the Republican central committee of the district instructed their constituent\n                  counties to select delegates to attend a convention to be held in Joliet on June 30,\n                  1858, at which the district Republicans would nominate their congressional candidate.\n                  Both the McLean County and the La Salle County Republican conventions endorsed Lovejoy\n                  for renomination. Following Lovejoy’s victory at the conventions in these two counties,\n                  his nomination seemed likely, based on his expected strong performance at the conventions\n                  of the counties in the northern and central part of the Third Congressional District.Howard W.

        "text": "6In hisletterto which this is a response, Lamon had informed Lincoln of a rumor that two abolitionists\n                  who had been delegates to the LaSalle County Republican convention had announced their\n                  support for Stephen A. Douglas’ reelection to the U.S. Senate. Douglas had criticized\n                  theLecompton Constitutionand PresidentJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in theDemocratic Party. Some Republicans were excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution\n                  to the extent that they considered supporting him in the election of 1858. Although\n                  Douglas later denied it, he courted Republican support—meeting in person with prominent\n                  Republicans and hinting in correspondence to Republicans that he was finished with\n                  the Democratic Party. In Lincoln’s view, Douglas disagreed with the Buchanan administration\n                  over whether the Lecompton Constitution accurately represented the will of Kansans,\n                  but did not repudiate the overall goal of admittingKansasas a slave state.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445-50."
