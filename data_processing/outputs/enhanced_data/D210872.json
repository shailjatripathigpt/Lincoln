Lundywrote Lincoln several letters in July and early August 1858 concerning the possibility\n                  of Lincoln traveling to Magnolia, Illinois, on August 20 to deliver a political  address\n                  before a mass gathering of members of theRepublican Party. At the time, Lincoln was theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. He was running againstDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglas. Because members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, both Lincoln\n                  and Douglas  canvassed thestatethroughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for the General Assembly in their respective parties.

In the midst of both Lundy’s\n                  and Lynch’s correspondence with him, Lincoln and Douglas set the schedule for a series\n                  ofpolitical debates. They scheduled the first of these debates for Saturday, August 21 inOttawa, Illinois, and rather than appearing in Magnolia as Lynch and Lundy proposed, Lincoln delivered\n                  a speech inPeoria, Illinois, on August 19, then spent the night of the 20th inMorris, Illinois, in order to reach Ottawa the following day.Ultimately, in Illinois’ local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Stephen A.
