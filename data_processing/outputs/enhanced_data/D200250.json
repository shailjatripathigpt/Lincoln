MrDOLLINSspoke against the amendment, and moved to lay it on the table, which was decided\n\nin the affirmative. Yeas 50, nays 33.3 So theHauserefused to strike out the enactment for bringing suit against the citizens of Springfield,\n\nand agreed that they ought to be sued. MrLINCOLNmoved to amend by inserting a proviso, that if any one of the obligors in the bond\n\nshall pay his proportionate share of indebtedness, he or they shall be free from all\n\nfurther obligation on the bond. MrROSSmoved to lay the above amendment on the table; which was negatived. Yeas 36, nays\n\n39.4 MrCAVARLYmoved to refer thebilland amendments to a select committee. MrCsaid he had voted to lay on the table the motion to strike out, not because he wished\n\nto sue and oppress the citizens, but because the amendment appeared to him calculated\n\nto operate as an entire release of the debt: he would move to refer to a select committee,\n\nthat the bill may be perfected so as to do justice and give satisfaction to all parties. Mr LINCOLN deprecated delay; the wants of the workmen were most urgent, and he hoped\n\nno delay would take place. MrPECKspoke against delay on the ground of the necessities of those who had performed the\n\nwork on the House. He suggested toMr Cavarly to withdraw the motion to refer, and propose an amendment in accordance\n\nwith the views he had expressed, so that thebillmight be passed immediately. Mr CAVARLY would pledge himself to report thebillimmediately after dinner, if the reference should be had and he be the chairman of\n\nthe committee. Mr ROSS opposed the reference: thebillheonsidered as good now as it would be after coming from the hands of thegentlemanfromGreen, (Mr Cavarly.) He considered the amendment contemplated to be intended to defeat the\n\ndebt. Mr BROWN, ofVermilion, denied he had ever contemplated an entire release of the debt on the bonds given;\n\nhe expressly repudiated any inference that he intended to release the obligation of\n\nthis debt; he believed the parties bound would pay it, and were bound to pay it, though\n\nhe thought it would more comport with the dignity of theHouseto release this debt. He proceeded further to deprecate the premature enforcement\n\nof this debt at this peculiar juncture, when a general paralysis palsied the energies\n\nof every part of theState.5 The question on the reference was then taken and negatived. Mr BROWN, of Vermilion, then offered an amendment providing that a new bond might\n\nbe executed, payable in three equal annual instalments, in lieu of the present bond;\n\nand, MrMcCLERNANDmoved to amend by adding a clause releasing entirely the citizens of Springfield\n\nfrom all obligation under the said bonds. Mr McCLERNAND said he had offered this amendment believing it to be but justice to\n\nthe citizens of Springfield that they should be released from this obligation, for\n\nseveral reasons; first, because it was not just or proper to make them pay a bonus\n\nfor the erection of a State House in theircity; secondly, because to enforce the payment at this time, would be unjust and oppressive;\n\nand thirdly, because it seriously affected the dignity and character of the State\n\nto enforce the payment of this money, as it presupposes bargain and sale, and the\n\nholding out of improper inducements to obtain the location of the seat of Government\n\nin this place: another reason against collecting the money was this, it is well known\n\nthat both the State and the people are embarrassed; the people require indulgence,\n\nand it ought to be given to them; this was one reason, but the great ground on which\n\nhe relied was this, that it is not becoming the people of this State to exact a bonus\n\nfrom a town or city for having the seat of Government located in such town: it carries\n\non its face the evidence of fraud, bargain, and sale, and is evidently too unworthy\n\na transaction to be countenanced by honorable men. It had been said in the course\n\nof debate that the mechanics and industrious working men of the city were those who\n\nwould cheerfully suffer if the bond be enforced: if so, he held it to be due from\n\nus to the citizens, in all charity, to release them from all responsibility and from\n\nall liability whatever. It was but a small sum to the State, and could not benefit\n\nit or enable it to disembarrass itself from present difficulties. He held it was\n\nunjust and ignoble to have made this bargain: the general good of the State required\n\nthe seat of Government to be located in a central place, and that a bonus of money\n\nought not to have been the great and sufficient inducement for bringing the seat of\n\nGovernment here. It appeared to him, therefore, that the honor and dignity of the\n\nState required that the citizens should be entirely released from all further payment\n\non their bond. MrMURPHY, ofPerry, spoke in opposition to the amendment; he must say, that as for himself, he remained\n\nentirely unconvinced by all that had fallen from the gentlemen fromMorganandGallatin, who had spoken in favor of releasing the citizens of Springfield from the payment\n\nof their debts. He could not, however agree with them in the views they had taken:\n\nthegentlemanfrom Morgan says that we might just as well exact a bonus from the citizens ofAltonfor having thePenetintiarybuilt there, as require this payment from Springfield for having the State House\n\nlocated here: and also thegentlemanfrom Gallatin has assumed the position that it is derogatory to the dignity of a\n\nsovereign State to enter into a bargain and receive this bonus. It appeared to him\n\nthat there was much sophistry in these arguments: it should be recollected that this\n\nwas a voluntary undertaking on the part of the citizens of Springfield to pay such\n\na sum towards the erection of this building in their city; it could not be said to\n\nbe an injustice to them to take this sum towards this public expense, for they were\n\nbenefitted by the work, and their property thereby more enhanced in value: it was\n\nbut just, therefore, that while the other citizens of the State paid their taxes for\n\nthis public work, those who were more especially and indeed exclusively benefitted\n\nshould pay something in the shape of a tax, though voluntarily entered into, more\n\nthan those who were not so immediately benefitted by the location. The principle\n\non which this money was to be paid appeared to him correct; it was nothing but what\n\nwas fair and just. This principle was recognized and acted upon in the matter of\n\ncounty seats, and its justice and correctness had never, as far as he knew, been called\n\nin question; it was well known to every member of this floor that laws were almost\n\ndaily passed in this House requiring individuals on whose lands the county seat was\n\nto be located, to donate a certain number of acres for public purposes: this was a\n\ncondition on which the county seat was to be located on any particular spot belonging\n\nto individuals, and they were always glad to accept the condition in consideration\n\nof the great advantages they derived in the increased value of their lands.—Now, the\n\nposition of the citizens of Springfield was, in his view, precisely the same. The\n\npayment of this sum was one of the conditions they had voluntarily assumed as a small\n\nreturn for the valuable considerations they would receive by the location of the seat\n\nof government in their city, and he saw no reason why the calling upon them for the\n\nfulfilment of their contract should be characterised by gentlemen on this floor as ungenerous or unbecoming a sovereign State. Surely\n\nif a county was not disgraced by receiving a donation of lands towards the public\n\nexpense of the county, the State was dishonored by receiving this sum from the citizens\n\nof Springfield. How many days ago is it since the gentleman from Gallatin proposed\n\nto donate 15 or 20 acres of land of canal lands for the purposes of a county seat? (MrMcClernandexplained: he had not proposed to donate the land, but to sell it.) He (Mr Murphy) stood corrected; well, then, it was not a donation, but it was something\n\nvery much like it, it appeared to him like the man who sold his dog for 100 dollars,\n\nand who got as he said, two fifty dollar dogs for it. Here was land worth $1000 and\n\nwas sold for $10 to thecountyfor its seat. Was not this intended as a donation? It was in reality nothing else\n\nbut a bonus to the county for the location, and thus it appears that the gentleman\n\nhimself acted in one case upon the very principle which he condemns as ignoble in\n\nanother case; but if the principle is right as to counties, it is also right as to\n\nthe State, for the counties collectively constitute the State. He should regret to\n\nsee this amendment pass; he thought the money ought to be collected, and if it was\n\nnot done now it never would be; now was the time, and he hoped thebillwould be passed immediately. Mr.OLDSmoved to lay the amendment of Mr. McClernand on the table, which motion prevailed,\n\nayes 69, noes 15.6 MrTURNEYmoved the previous question which was not ordered.7Mr.T. then moved an amendment to thebillproviding that the people ofWayne countyshould have a similar extension of time for the paying of their taxes: lost.

It had been said in the course\n               of debate that the mechanics and industrious working men of the city were those who\n               would cheerfully suffer if the bond be enforced: if so, he held it to be due from\n               us to the citizens, in all charity, to release them from all responsibility and from\n               all liability whatever.  It was but a small sum to the State, and could not benefit\n               it or enable it to disembarrass itself from present difficulties.  He held it was\n               unjust and ignoble to have made this bargain: the general good of the State required\n               the seat of Government to be located in a central place, and that a bonus of money\n               ought not to have been the great and sufficient inducement for bringing the seat of\n               Government here.  It appeared to him, therefore, that the honor and dignity of the\n               State required that the citizens should be entirely released from all further payment\n               on their bond."

        "text": "MrMURPHY, ofPerry, spoke in opposition to the amendment; he must say, that as for himself, he remained\n               entirely unconvinced by all that had fallen from the gentlemen fromMorganandGallatin, who had spoken in favor of releasing the citizens of Springfield from the payment\n               of their debts.  He could not, however agree with them in the views they had taken:\n               thegentlemanfrom Morgan says that we might just as well exact a bonus from the citizens ofAltonfor having thePenetintiarybuilt there, as require this payment from Springfield for having the State House\n               located here: and also thegentlemanfrom Gallatin has assumed the position that it is derogatory to the dignity of a\n               sovereign State to enter into a bargain and receive this bonus.  It appeared to him\n               that there was much sophistry in these arguments: it should be recollected that this\n               was  a voluntary undertaking on the part of the citizens of Springfield to pay such\n               a sum towards the erection of this building in their city; it could not be said to\n               be an injustice to them to take this sum towards this public expense, for they were\n               benefitted by the work, and their property thereby more enhanced in value: it was\n               but just, therefore, that while the other citizens of the State paid their taxes for\n               this public work, those who were more especially and indeed exclusively benefitted\n               should pay something in the shape of a tax, though voluntarily entered into, more\n               than those who were not so immediately benefitted by the location.  The principle\n               on which this money was to be paid appeared to him correct; it was nothing but what\n               was fair and just.  This principle was recognized and acted upon in the matter of\n               county seats, and its justice and correctness had never, as far as he knew, been called\n               in question; it was well known to every member of this floor that laws were almost\n               daily passed in this House requiring individuals on whose lands the county seat was\n               to be located, to donate a certain number of acres for public purposes: this was a\n               condition on which the county seat was to be located on any particular spot belonging\n               to individuals, and they were always glad to accept the condition in consideration\n               of the great advantages they derived in the increased value of their lands.—Now, the\n               position of the citizens of Springfield was, in his view, precisely the same.  The\n               payment of this sum was one of the conditions they had voluntarily assumed as a small\n               return for the valuable considerations they would receive by the location of the seat\n               of government in their city, and he saw no reason why the calling upon them for the\n               fulfilment of their contract should be characterised by gentlemen on this floor as ungenerous or unbecoming a sovereign State.  Surely\n               if a county was not disgraced by receiving a donation of lands towards the public\n               expense of the county, the State was dishonored by receiving this sum from the citizens\n               of Springfield.  How many days ago is it since the gentleman from Gallatin proposed\n               to donate 15 or 20 acres of land of canal lands for the purposes of a county seat?"

Here was land worth $1000 and\n               was sold for $10 to thecountyfor its seat.  Was not this intended as a donation? It was in reality nothing else\n               but a bonus to the county for the location, and thus it appears that the gentleman\n               himself acted in one case upon the very principle which he condemns as ignoble in\n               another case; but if the principle is right as to counties, it is also right as to\n               the State, for the counties collectively constitute the State.  He should regret to\n               see this amendment pass; he thought the money ought to be collected, and if it was\n               not done now it never would be; now was the time, and he hoped thebillwould be passed immediately."
