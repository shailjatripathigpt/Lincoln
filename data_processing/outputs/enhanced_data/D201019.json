        "text": "4In the caseDavenport v. Sconce & DonCarlos, William H. Davenport purchased land fromLafayette H. SconceandWilliam C. Don Carlosfor $480 in March 1856. Davenport gave Sconce the $480, and Sconce gave Davenport\n                  a quit claim deed on the land as well as a $2,000 bond promising to give Davenport\n                  a warranty deed after Sconce received a patent from theU.S. General Land Office. Davenport claimed that although only Sconce’s name was on the bond, the contract\n                  was with both Sconce and Don Carlos. In March 1857, Davenport retained Lincoln andShelby M. Cullomand sued in the Vermilion County Circuit Court to have the contract voided and receive\n                  either the present value of the land or have his money refunded, plus interest. Davenport\n                  charged that Sconce and Don Carlos tried to defraud him and take his money by concealing\n                  information that proved that they had no legal title to the land.Documentation in the Danville, Illinois branch of the General Land Office office revealed\n                  that Sylvester W. Richmond had entered the land to receive a patent long before Sconce\n                  developed an interest in the land, but that Richmond’s patent entry had been declared\n                  invalid because of a minor issue with the land warrant. The U.S. General Land Office\n                  inWashington, DC, directed the Danville land office to notify Richmond of this issue and permit him\n                  to enter a valid warrant on the land. Davenport alleged that Don Carlos—who served\n                  as the Danville land office’s clerk for a time—did not notify Richmond of the cancellation\n                  of his patent entry, but put a fraudulent note in the Danville land office books that\n                  Richmond had been notified, then colluded with Sconce to claim the land. Richmond\n                  did not learn that his patent entry was cancelled until Don Carlos procured the land\n                  to be entered in Sconce’s name. Richmond then wrote to the U.S. General Land Office,\n                  which issued him a valid patent for the land in October 1856, took possession of the\n                  land, and improved it to the point that it was worth $15.00 per acre.John N. Drake,John C. Moses, and, eventually,Elias S. Terryrepresented Sconce and Don Carlos in the case, which first came before the Vermilion\n                  County Circuit Court in April 1857. On November 24, 1860, JudgeDavid Davisruled for Davenport, declared the land purchase invalid, and ordered Sconce and Don\n                  Carlos to refund Davenport’s $480 and pay half the court costs related to the case.Lincoln wrote William H. Davenport one more letter regarding this case after this May 22, 1858\n                  letter.Bill of Complaint, Document ID: 4611; Attorney’s Notes, Document ID: 4606; Judge’s\n                     Docket, Document ID: 59014; Decree, Document ID: 59035; Judge’s Docket, Document ID:\n                     59037; Judgment Docket, Document ID: 59038;Davenport v.

        "text": "5Lincoln is discussing another legal case in this final sentence:Davenport v. Davenport et al. In this case, Lucy A. Davenport sued William Davenport, William H. Davenport, and\n                  several others in April 1856 in theWoodford County Circuit Court. She claimed that her late husband, John Davenport, held title to ninety-two acres\n                  of land that he had purchased from William Davenport. She petitioned the court for\n                  her dower from the land.Dower was a form of estate that provided for a widow’s needs out of her husband's\n                  real and personal property, and such property was not subject to creditor’s demands.\n                  In antebellumIllinois, the widow of a man with children received one-third of the land that her husband\n                  owned at any time during their marriage for the rest of her life, unless she relinquished\n                  her dower rights in the prescribed manner. If her deceased husband had no children,\n                  the widow received outright ownership of one-half of the estate.William H. Davenport retained Lincoln. Lucy dismissed the case, but later motioned\n                  to reinstate it. The court did so, and, after several continuances, in October 1858\n                  Judge James Harriott ruled for the defendants and dismissed her petition.“Dower,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
