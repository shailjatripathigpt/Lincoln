        "text": "4Lincoln references amending the sheriff’s return on a summons in a lawsuit betweenJeremiah S. HallandJohn Wilson.  In 1840, Hall won a judgment against Anderson Ashburn and Jesse Ashburn in the\n                  Justice of the Peace Court inMcLean County.  At the execution sale, Hall bought forty acres owned by Anderson Ashburn, but Hall\n                  never received a certificate of purchase.  Before the judgment, Hall claimed that\n                  Anderson Ashburn had fraudulently given the forty acres to Wilson at no charge, and\n                  the recorder had never recorded the transaction.  In April 1853, Hall sued Wilson\n                  in theWoodford County Circuit Courtto perfect the title and to force Wilson to convey his interest to Hall.  Wilson\n                  retained Lincoln, who amended SheriffMartin Scott's return on the summons.  The court dismissed the case due to lack of prosecution,\n                  but Hall reinstated the case to add Anderson Ashburn's heirs.  The outcome of the\n                  case is unknown.Writ of Fieri Facias, Document ID: 56352; Judge's Docket, Document ID: 56358,Hall v. Wilson, Martha L.
