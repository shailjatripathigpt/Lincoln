The Hon.Speakersaid, that he was perfectly aware, that it might seem to some a hopelestask, considering what exertions have been, and are now making, both in and out of\n\nthe House, to cause a removal of the seat of government to Springfield, to struggle\n\nagainst such a current; but it was a principle with him to adhere to a good cause,\n\nand to defend it, so long as he had life and breath remaining; and when the house\n\nshould have considered the bill in all its bearings, it might be that, notwithstanding\n\nthe powerful delegation fromSangamonsupported it, backed by its numerous friends in the lobby, it would be rejected.\n\nWas it expected, when, at the last session of theLegislature, $50,000 were, upon certain conditions, appropriated, that so large an appropriation\n\nwould now be asked for? Was it expected, the capitol was to be commenced upon a scale\n\nso magnificent; that Illinois, with her very slender taxable resources, with an immense\n\ndebt upon her hands, and a gigantic system of Internal Improvements set on foot, would\n\nyet lay the foundation of another work, upon a scale of expensiveness almost without\n\na parallel in the valley of theMississippi?3 A former Legislature thought $50,000 an ample appropriation; but the bill before us\n\nproposes to appropriate $128,000; and reasoning from the past to the future, it might\n\nreasonably be expected that at the next session of the Legislature, still more will\n\nbe demanded. Do gentlemen seriously suppose that the projected capitol at Springfield\n\nis to be completed with the appropriation now asked for? What has been the fact in\n\nsimilar cases elsewhere? Why, that the expense of such works uniformily exceeds the\n\nestimates. Already the expense of the mere foundation of this “cut stone palace”\n\nexceeds appropriations actually made; in addition to this, the executive has taken\n\n$3,000 from the contingent fund; the commissioners have made themselves liable for\n\n$12,000 more; and where is this prodigal and reckless system of expenditure to end?\n\nOne hundred thousand dollars ought to have covered the entire cost of this building.\n\nWe are not a rich people; and shall we go on to borrow money for the purpose of constructing\n\nfine buildings, when the plain ones will, for the present, accommodate us equally\n\nwell? What State has ever done this, that had the least self-respect? Depend upon\n\nit, we are undertaking a work, that we have not the necessary means of accomplishing.\n\nLook at the report of yourAuditor of Public Accounts. Why, the entire revenue of the State does not amount to one half the sum asked\n\nfor by this bill, to go on with the building of the edifice in question. At the same\n\ntime, the State owes an enormous debt, a wicked and infamous debt of $100,0004; and what is more than all, the school-fund is invaded, and swallowed up, in schemes\n\nofInternal Improvement5; rather than to have touched which—sacred as it is to the cause of education—your\n\njudges and governors should have served the country gratuitously. Collect all these\n\nitems into one sum; add to them the State-bonds for the construction of railroads,\n\nand what wiil be needful to complete theIllinois and Michigan Canal, and you will find Illinois involved already to the amount of some six millions and\n\na half of dollars.6 He concluded his remarks, which the limits of our sheet have compelled us to condense,\n\nby saying, that as he was aware that gentlemen had determined, if possible, to carry\n\nthrough the bill, he had come prepared with a series of propositions, which he intended\n\nto present successively, if the first were rejected. Mr Lincoln said, that as theHon. Speakerhad confined his remarks to the expensiveness of the work under consideration, he\n\nwould not wander from this point himself. And, indeed, it was unnecessary to say\n\nmuch upon that subject; for he believed that the majority would agree, that if the\n\nthe work was to be done all, it had best be well done; that is, in a manner creditable\n\nto the State. He felt perfectly willing to submit the question to the House, without\n\nsaying one word more. The question was then taken, and decided in the negative. Mr Ewing then proposed another amendment, the purport of which was—that a board of\n\nseven commissioners, one from each Judicial District, should be appointed, whose duty\n\nit should be to locate anew the seat of government, if possible, on some of the public\n\nlands, if not on some other eligible site of one mile square. On this, a city to\n\nbe laid out in lots; these to be advertised and sold; with the proceeds of which,\n\na revenue was to be obtained for building a State-house, and for other purposes. In explaining and defending this project, theHon. Speakeravowed the object of those provisions to be—to relieve the State, in part, of that\n\nload of debt under which she now labors; and to put the seat of government on a permanent\n\nbasis. He contended that the existing law, providing for a change in the seat of\n\ngovernment, is a violation of the constitution, and that it has exerted an oppressive\n\naction upon the interests of Vandalia—has caused a depreciation in the value of property,\n\nand occasioned a stagnation in business. He had calculated, that if his plan were\n\ncarried into effect, something like half a million of money would be realized by the\n\nsale of city lots—which would not only suffice for building a State House, on a respectable\n\nscale, but be a permanent source of revenue to the State. Mr Bakercalled for the reading of a part of the amendment, in order that he might not be\n\naccused of misrepresenting its provisions. He then attempted to shew, that there\n\nwas some degree of inconsistency between these, and that part of theHon. Speaker’s argument, which went to shew that all past legislative action upon this subject\n\nhas been unconstitutional. But, if it was unconstitutional to legislate upon this\n\nsubject in 1832-4 and 6, because the people of 1840 could not be consulted, can it\n\nbe constitutional to legislate upon it now? Can the Commissioners go on, according\n\nto the gentleman’s plan, to locate and sell town-lots, without consulting the poor,\n\ndear people of 1840! He then went on to say, thatHon. gentlemanwas mistaken in some of his facts, and in the inferences that he drew from some of\n\nthese. He is mistaken in saying that the estimates of Architects are always wrong.\n\nThose who spend their lives in the midst of these inquiries ought to know more about\n\nthem than either theHon. gentlemanor himself. Admit that Architects aresometimesmistaken in their estimates, they are not always so; and if the gentleman reasons\n\nfrom the past to the present, it would be well perhaps to inquire whether $60,000\n\nhad been already expended, under the immediate superintendence of an able Architect,\n\nthis individual might not, by this time, have corrected any mistakes into which he\n\nmight at first have fallen. The mere loose guess of that gentleman, that the present\n\nestimate of $128,000 falls far below the sum that will be actually required to complete\n\nthe State House, is not to be suffered to overthrow the sober calculations of practical\n\nmen. He denied, then, the conclusion, that $200,000 would be necessary to complete\n\nit.—About $60,000—not to exceed $65,000—have been already expended. From 6 to $10,000\n\nhave been borrowed upon the private credit of individuals; and $50,000 amply secured\n\nto the State; a part of which, viz: $33,600, has been actually re imbursed. There\n\nis, then, no reason for saying that the State House is to cost the people $200,000\n\nmore. And now the question comes up, shall the State expend $128,000, in addition to the\n\nsum already expended?7Upon this question, he was perfectly willing that the House should decide, without\n\nfurther argument. It is said, that this is to be a mostmagnificentbuilding, without sufficiently considering the standard with which it ought to be\n\ncompared. It would not be considered splendid or magnificent by the side of St. Peter’s,\n\nSt. Paul’s, or the Capitol atWashington, or the State House ofN. Carolina, which is estimated to have cost $700,000; or that proposed to be built inOhio, at an expense of $550,000, and which is to cover a space more than twice as large\n\nas ours at Springfield; or the one planned for the State ofMissouri, at an estimate of 325,000 dollars, or that ofArkansas, which is to be at least a size larger than what some gentlemen are pleased contemptuously\n\nto style the “cut stone palace” at Springfield.8 He was at a loss to know what gentlemen meant by applying the termmagnificentto our capitol at Springfield. It might be on a somewhat more liberal scale, than\n\nthe building in which he now had the honor to speak; but it was not magnificent, compared\n\nwith the advantage to be gained; for, if it cost four times as much, it would, he\n\nexpected, be four times as good. Is it magnificent in comparison with our system of\n\nInternal Improvments? No! For his own part, he hoped that both would answer the wishes\n\nand expectations of their most sanguine friends. The State is now somewhat richer\n\nthan she was in the days of the Wiggins loan. Then, she was unable to pay her debts;\n\nnow, she is able, and he hoped, willing to consult for her dignity. The State House\n\nnow in progress of construction, is not on too large a scale for our prospects with\n\nrespect to Illinois; nor for the accommodation of the Legislature, nor the actual\n\nresources of the State. He hoped the House, in fixing the seat of Government at Springfield,\n\nwould bear in mind, that they were probably fixing it there for many years. That\n\nprinciple in human nature, which is constantly urging removal, and exciting to change,\n\nhowever allowable in individuals, should not be indulged in legislation. Before the\n\nlast session of the Legislature, indeed, it would have been premature to fix the seat\n\nof Government permanently; but now, we know about where the centre of the popoulation\n\nof the State of Illinois, will fall and remain for a long time to come, and what are\n\nto be her now dawning glories, when fully risen; so that, when this question is\n\nonce more settled, probably it will be settled, if not forever, at least for a hundred\n\nyears to come. He then adverted to the taste and judgment exhited in the plan of the work, and in so much of the work itself as is already executed—the\n\nnatural advantages of Springfield and its vicinity—its facilities of access, and its\n\nhealthfulness; and contended that no other point could be found, combining so many\n\nadvantages, any where near the centre of the State. Now, it is these that make towns,\n\nnot thefiatof Legislatures. The wealth and fashion that may assemble at the seat of government,\n\nduring the session of the General Assembly, will neither make nor support a town,\n\nthough they may aid. Nor can you at once create a city by laying off lots, and advertising\n\nthem for sale; for, wealth and enterprise will go where business is to be done. There\n\nis no board of commissioners whose designation of a capital would satisfy the people\n\nof a whole State; this is a duty that can be performed by the people alone; and it\n\nhas been done by the people of Illinois, acting through their representatives. A\n\nsite has been chosen, which is convenient of access; and the money of its inhabitants\n\nhas been received in aid of the work.9Why should the fixed plan of the State be now changed! The feeling which would prompt\n\nthis course of legislation today, may prompt a different course to-morrow; and what\n\nsecurity could the citizens of any place have, that you would not abandon them, after\n\nmaking great sacrifices on the implied good faith of the State?—What could satisfy\n\nthem, save some fixed contract, that the members of the Legislature were not a vacillating,\n\nmoney-shaving set, willing at any time to change the location of the capital, through\n\nthe influence of mere sectional or party feeling? Rather, now, let the State continue\n\ntrue to her pervious determination, to her plighted faith; and, though she had made\n\na less desirable place her choice, let her consider herself as sacredly bound to abide\n\nby it, so long as there is a place to sustain the walls of the capitol. But when,\n\nin process of time, our fruitful soil, teeming everywhere with the waving wreath of\n\nthe husbandman, and our three millions of citizens shall make ours the first State\n\nin the Union, and the current of emigration shall have made the north by far the most\n\npopulous section of Illinois,then, let the seat of government go northward too; and there let it be fixed forever.10In favoring the location at Springfield now, he endeavored, for his own part, to\n\nkeep clear of local prejudices, and he hoped that other gentlemen would do so; and\n\ngive their vote for that place, not for the sake of Sangamon county, but because that\n\nwould best subserve the interests of the whole people, without suffering anyad captandumproject to prevail against it. Mr. Ficklinsaid, that as his constituents had an interest in this subject, he wished to say\n\na few words to show them that he had not been unmindful of their interest. Though\n\nthis is a question that has been agitated many years, it is one that is still in some\n\nmeasure open to debate. He did not look upon it as having been yet finally decided,\n\neither by the legislature or the people, and though he could wish that a larger part\n\nof this House were with him, (for we all delight to be cheered on by the majority)\n\nyet he felt that it would be cowardly to abandon a good cause, because its friends\n\nhappen to be few. After stating the subject, he asked whether Illinois would choose to expend the sum\n\nnecessary to complete the State House at Springfield, out of her treasury? and whether\n\nthe faith of the State is actually pledged to go on with that building. He challenged\n\ngentlemen to show him any such pledge. On the other hand, the State had always been\n\nmost guarded, in her legislation on this subject. She had always said to the people\n\nof Springfield, if you expend money on a State House there, you expend it at your\n\nown hazard. It will not be pretended that, a law was passed at the last session absolutely\n\nfixing the Capitol at Springfield. That law is one of the most guarded laws he had\n\never read. It said to the corporation of Springfield—“I hold you responsible for\n\nthis appropriation; your bonds must be filed within a certain time, and a certain\n\nsum must be paid into the treasury;” and after all, the State reserves to herself\n\nthe right to repeal the act at any time hereafter. That money is not yet paid, though\n\nthe stipulated time is past; only two instalments are paid; of course, Springfield\n\ncan not now set up the claim of right. We may, it is true, agitate this subject, but it rightfully rests with the people\n\nof Illinois in 1840 to decide. The constitution has guarantied that the Capitol of\n\nthe State should be at Vandalia for twenty years; which time has not yet expired;\n\nuntil it has expired, the subject should not be taken up.11When the proper time arrives, then the whole people of Illinois are to be consulted,\n\nas to the proper location. Instead of this, we are taking the business out of the\n\nhands of those to whom it properly belongs, we appropriate largely, and expend beyond\n\nall appropriations, and after laying out some $200,000 and putting up this cut-stone\n\npalace, the people are told to send their representatives thither to make laws. It has been said that something more is necessary to make a town, than to lay off\n\nlots, and make appropriations for building a State House;—true, sir; but why haste\n\naway fromthisplace? This House in large enough and good enough for us, and our successors, for\n\nsome time to come. Let any of our constituents examine the house in which I now have\n\nthe honor of speaking, and I take it upon myself to say that they would pronounce\n\nit amply large, amply commodious; and if we forsake it, and at a great expense erect\n\nanother Capitol at Springfield, will they not say to us—“Why did you leave that building—why\n\nincrease our already large debt, for the sake of sitting in a cut-stone palace at\n\nSpringfield?” Unquestionably, sir, this building will answer the purpose ten years\n\nto come; and within that time, we can consult the people, make a suitable location,\n\nerect our State House and furnish it, and take possession. For his own part, his\n\ncourse would be a decided one of opposition to the contemplated removal. It is a\n\nquestion which ought to be submitted to the people of 1840. Mr. Lincoln, in reply, contended that the people of 1840 would have no better right\n\nto decide the question, than the people of 1839. True, the inhabitants of Vandalia\n\nhad a right to retain the seat of government here twenty years, according to the provisions\n\nof the Constitution; but, on the other hand, if the people of Illinois at large had\n\nfound that they had a hard bargain, they have a right to get out of it as soon as\n\nthey can. Has not the corporation of Springfield faithfully performed her part of\n\nthe contract? Two thirds of the stipulated sum is paid; and for the other third which\n\nis not paid, thebondsof twenty-five responsible men are put forward, which may be sued at any time, and\n\nare perfectly secure, so far as the interest of the State is involved. He could not\n\nsay, indeed, with his colleague, that he consideredthe faith of the State as pledgedto complete the State House at Springfield; but wished that work to go on, and that\n\nplace to be made the permanent seat of government; because it was the place of his\n\nresidence, and because he really believed that the people would thus be best accommodated.\n\nTrue, when the question of a Capitol was formerly submitted to the people at large,\n\nSpringfield did not receive the highest number of votes; but this can furnish no evidence\n\nthat if the question were now a second time submitted to the same tribunal, Springfield\n\nwould not have a larger vote than any other point. As tomaking moneyby locating the Capitol in some new place, and selling the lots of a citythat is to be, he would simply ask how much money had been made, and how many State Houses had\n\nbeen built out of the land received here in Vandalia, as a donation from the General\n\nGovernment? Depend upon it, the idea of realizing such immense sums of money in this\n\nway, is all an illusion.—As for the unconstitutionality of agitating this question\n\nat present, he hardly expected that those who bring forward a series of plans, of\n\nthe same general nature with this now in progress at Springfield, would throw upon\n\ntheir opponents this charge; for each and all of these is equally unconstitutional. TheHon, Speakerthen rose, and read the state of the votes given for the different proposed points,\n\nwhen the question was submitted to the people; by which it appeared, thatAltonhad the highest number of votes, Vandalia the second highest number, while Springfield\n\nwas third on the list, and was actually in a minority of several hundred. Have the\n\nsentiments of the people at large undergone a change since that time?12Of 24,000 votes then polled, Springfield had but 7,730; and of course had something\n\nlike 17,000 against her. It is admitted that some of the northern counties have since\n\nthat period increased in population in a greater ratio than the southern ones; but\n\nit does not follow of course, that the friends of Springfield have been multiplied\n\nin the same proportion. Now some of the northern counties, asCook,Joe Davis,Warren,PeoriaandTazewell, at that time, gave a majority of their votes against Springfield, and in favor of\n\nsome other place. There are now some 40,000 voters; and perhaps, were they now consulted,\n\nthey could suit themselves better than at Springfield. The House in which we are\n\nnow convened, no one will deny, is sufficiently large for our accommodation; but when\n\nthe legislature becomes too large to be received within its walls, and a new capitol\n\nis to be built, let the change take place without causing additional expense to the\n\nState. It has been triumphantly asked, how many State Houses were built with the\n\nproceeds of sales of the land, donated byCongressfor the benefit of the Capitol here at Vandalia. He would answer the gentleman;\n\ntwo had been built;—a temporary one, which had given place to this that we now occupy.\n\nBut, it must be recollected, that when that donation was made, and that land sold,\n\nIllinois had a population of only 10,000 votes south of this parallel, and Vandalia\n\nwas a frontier settlement. Lots therefore went low;—so low, that a law was subsequently\n\npassed for the relief of the purchasers. But, times have improved; and if a new location\n\nof the seat of government were now made,—at some central point, convenient of access\n\nto all portions of the State, and with an eye to those conveniences of approach which\n\nwill be furnished by our contemplated Rail-roads, the scheme of raising a revenue\n\nfrom the sale of its lots would be more promising. Springfield could not probably\n\nat present accommodate the General Assembly much better than Vandalia does; and it\n\nis doubtful whether it could in ten years to come; and even here, we are growing better,\n\nand shall every year furnish more comfortable quarters to the members of the Legislature.\n\nLet Vandalia continue, then, to be the seat of government, till the interests of the\n\ncountry absolutely require its removal, and then he would be willing to see the change\n\nmade. He made other remarks, which our limits oblige us to omit. The question being taken\n\non his amendment, was decided in the negative. TheHon. Speakerthen rose, and said, that at the risk of being tenacious, he would introduce another\n\namendment, the leading provisions of which, were to submit the question of location\n\nagain to the people; and if there should be no choice, to return to the people thefiveplaces, having the highest number of votes, to be voted upon again. If no choice\n\namong these, then thethreehighest the second time returned from the people, to be voted upon by them the third\n\ntime. If no choice, then the election to be made between the two highest the third\n\ntime returned. The question being taken, this proposition was rejected.13",

      "be constitutional to legislate upon it now? Can the Commissioners go on, according",
      "to the gentleman’s plan, to locate and sell town-lots, without consulting the poor,",
      "dear people of 1840! He then went on to say, thatHon. gentlemanwas mistaken in some of his facts, and in the inferences that he drew from some of",
      "these. He is mistaken in saying that the estimates of Architects are always wrong.",
      "Those who spend their lives in the midst of these inquiries ought to know more about",
      "them than either theHon. gentlemanor himself. Admit that Architects aresometimesmistaken in their estimates, they are not always so; and if the gentleman reasons",
      "from the past to the present, it would be well perhaps to inquire whether $60,000",
      "had been already expended, under the immediate superintendence of an able Architect,",
      "this individual might not, by this time, have corrected any mistakes into which he",
      "might at first have fallen. The mere loose guess of that gentleman, that the present",
      "estimate of $128,000 falls far below the sum that will be actually required to complete",
      "the State House, is not to be suffered to overthrow the sober calculations of practical",
      "men. He denied, then, the conclusion, that $200,000 would be necessary to complete",
      "it.—About $60,000—not to exceed $65,000—have been already expended. From 6 to $10,000",
      "have been borrowed upon the private credit of individuals; and $50,000 amply secured",
      "to the State; a part of which, viz: $33,600, has been actually re imbursed. There",
      "is, then, no reason for saying that the State House is to cost the people $200,000",
      "more. And now the question comes up, shall the State expend $128,000, in addition to the",
      "sum already expended?7Upon this question, he was perfectly willing that the House should decide, without",
      "further argument. It is said, that this is to be a mostmagnificentbuilding, without sufficiently considering the standard with which it ought to be",
      "compared. It would not be considered splendid or magnificent by the side of St. Peter’s,",
      "St. Paul’s, or the Capitol atWashington, or the State House ofN. Carolina, which is estimated to have cost $700,000; or that proposed to be built inOhio, at an expense of $550,000, and which is to cover a space more than twice as large",
      "as ours at Springfield; or the one planned for the State ofMissouri, at an estimate of 325,000 dollars, or that ofArkansas, which is to be at least a size larger than what some gentlemen are pleased contemptuously",
      "to style the “cut stone palace” at Springfield.8 He was at a loss to know what gentlemen meant by applying the termmagnificentto our capitol at Springfield. It might be on a somewhat more liberal scale, than",
      "the building in which he now had the honor to speak; but it was not magnificent, compared",
      "with the advantage to be gained; for, if it cost four times as much, it would, he",
      "expected, be four times as good. Is it magnificent in comparison with our system of",
      "Internal Improvments? No! For his own part, he hoped that both would answer the wishes",
      "and expectations of their most sanguine friends. The State is now somewhat richer",
      "than she was in the days of the Wiggins loan. Then, she was unable to pay her debts;",
      "now, she is able, and he hoped, willing to consult for her dignity. The State House",
      "now in progress of construction, is not on too large a scale for our prospects with",
      "respect to Illinois; nor for the accommodation of the Legislature, nor the actual",
      "resources of the State. He hoped the House, in fixing the seat of Government at Springfield,",
      "would bear in mind, that they were probably fixing it there for many years. That",
      "principle in human nature, which is constantly urging removal, and exciting to change,",
      "however allowable in individuals, should not be indulged in legislation. Before the",
      "last session of the Legislature, indeed, it would have been premature to fix the seat",
      "of Government permanently; but now, we know about where the centre of the popoulation",
      "of the State of Illinois, will fall and remain for a long time to come, and what are",
      "to be her now dawning glories, when fully risen; so that, when this question is",
      "once more settled, probably it will be settled, if not forever, at least for a hundred",
      "years to come. He then adverted to the taste and judgment exhited in the plan of the work, and in so much of the work itself as is already executed—the",
      "natural advantages of Springfield and its vicinity—its facilities of access, and its",
      "healthfulness; and contended that no other point could be found, combining so many",
      "advantages, any where near the centre of the State. Now, it is these that make towns,",
      "not thefiatof Legislatures. The wealth and fashion that may assemble at the seat of government,",
      "during the session of the General Assembly, will neither make nor support a town,",
      "though they may aid. Nor can you at once create a city by laying off lots, and advertising",
      "them for sale; for, wealth and enterprise will go where business is to be done. There",
      "is no board of commissioners whose designation of a capital would satisfy the people",
      "of a whole State; this is a duty that can be performed by the people alone; and it",
      "has been done by the people of Illinois, acting through their representatives. A",
      "site has been chosen, which is convenient of access; and the money of its inhabitants",
      "has been received in aid of the work.9Why should the fixed plan of the State be now changed! The feeling which would prompt",
      "this course of legislation today, may prompt a different course to-morrow; and what",
      "security could the citizens of any place have, that you would not abandon them, after",
      "making great sacrifices on the implied good faith of the State?—What could satisfy",
      "them, save some fixed contract, that the members of the Legislature were not a vacillating,",
      "money-shaving set, willing at any time to change the location of the capital, through",
      "the influence of mere sectional or party feeling? Rather, now, let the State continue",
      "true to her pervious determination, to her plighted faith; and, though she had made",
      "a less desirable place her choice, let her consider herself as sacredly bound to abide",
      "by it, so long as there is a place to sustain the walls of the capitol. But when,",
      "in process of time, our fruitful soil, teeming everywhere with the waving wreath of",
      "the husbandman, and our three millions of citizens shall make ours the first State",
      "in the Union, and the current of emigration shall have made the north by far the most",
      "populous section of Illinois,then, let the seat of government go northward too; and there let it be fixed forever.10In favoring the location at Springfield now, he endeavored, for his own part, to",
      "keep clear of local prejudices, and he hoped that other gentlemen would do so; and",
      "give their vote for that place, not for the sake of Sangamon county, but because that",
      "would best subserve the interests of the whole people, without suffering anyad captandumproject to prevail against it. Mr. Ficklinsaid, that as his constituents had an interest in this subject, he wished to say",
      "a few words to show them that he had not been unmindful of their interest. Though",
      "this is a question that has been agitated many years, it is one that is still in some",
      "measure open to debate. He did not look upon it as having been yet finally decided,",
      "either by the legislature or the people, and though he could wish that a larger part",
      "of this House were with him, (for we all delight to be cheered on by the majority)",
      "yet he felt that it would be cowardly to abandon a good cause, because its friends",
      "happen to be few. After stating the subject, he asked whether Illinois would choose to expend the sum",
      "necessary to complete the State House at Springfield, out of her treasury? and whether",
      "the faith of the State is actually pledged to go on with that building. He challenged",
      "gentlemen to show him any such pledge. On the other hand, the State had always been",
      "most guarded, in her legislation on this subject. She had always said to the people",
      "of Springfield, if you expend money on a State House there, you expend it at your",
      "own hazard. It will not be pretended that, a law was passed at the last session absolutely",
      "fixing the Capitol at Springfield. That law is one of the most guarded laws he had",
      "ever read. It said to the corporation of Springfield—“I hold you responsible for",
      "this appropriation; your bonds must be filed within a certain time, and a certain",
      "sum must be paid into the treasury;” and after all, the State reserves to herself",
      "the right to repeal the act at any time hereafter. That money is not yet paid, though",
      "the stipulated time is past; only two instalments are paid; of course, Springfield",
      "can not now set up the claim of right. We may, it is true, agitate this subject, but it rightfully rests with the people",
      "of Illinois in 1840 to decide. The constitution has guarantied that the Capitol of",
      "the State should be at Vandalia for twenty years; which time has not yet expired;",
      "until it has expired, the subject should not be taken up.11When the proper time arrives, then the whole people of Illinois are to be consulted,",
      "as to the proper location. Instead of this, we are taking the business out of the",
      "hands of those to whom it properly belongs, we appropriate largely, and expend beyond",
      "all appropriations, and after laying out some $200,000 and putting up this cut-stone",
      "palace, the people are told to send their representatives thither to make laws. It has been said that something more is necessary to make a town, than to lay off",
      "lots, and make appropriations for building a State House;—true, sir; but why haste",
      "away fromthisplace? This House in large enough and good enough for us, and our successors, for",
      "some time to come. Let any of our constituents examine the house in which I now have",
      "the honor of speaking, and I take it upon myself to say that they would pronounce",
      "it amply large, amply commodious; and if we forsake it, and at a great expense erect",
      "another Capitol at Springfield, will they not say to us—“Why did you leave that building—why",
      "increase our already large debt, for the sake of sitting in a cut-stone palace at",
      "Springfield?” Unquestionably, sir, this building will answer the purpose ten years",
      "to come; and within that time, we can consult the people, make a suitable location,",
      "erect our State House and furnish it, and take possession. For his own part, his",
      "course would be a decided one of opposition to the contemplated removal. It is a",
      "question which ought to be submitted to the people of 1840. Mr. Lincoln, in reply, contended that the people of 1840 would have no better right",
      "to decide the question, than the people of 1839. True, the inhabitants of Vandalia",
      "had a right to retain the seat of government here twenty years, according to the provisions",
      "of the Constitution; but, on the other hand, if the people of Illinois at large had",
      "found that they had a hard bargain, they have a right to get out of it as soon as",
      "they can. Has not the corporation of Springfield faithfully performed her part of",
      "the contract? Two thirds of the stipulated sum is paid; and for the other third which",
      "is not paid, thebondsof twenty-five responsible men are put forward, which may be sued at any time, and",
      "are perfectly secure, so far as the interest of the State is involved. He could not",
      "say, indeed, with his colleague, that he consideredthe faith of the State as pledgedto complete the State House at Springfield; but wished that work to go on, and that",
      "place to be made the permanent seat of government; because it was the place of his",
      "residence, and because he really believed that the people would thus be best accommodated.",
      "True, when the question of a Capitol was formerly submitted to the people at large,",
      "Springfield did not receive the highest number of votes; but this can furnish no evidence",
      "that if the question were now a second time submitted to the same tribunal, Springfield",
      "would not have a larger vote than any other point. As tomaking moneyby locating the Capitol in some new place, and selling the lots of a citythat is to be, he would simply ask how much money had been made, and how many State Houses had",
      "been built out of the land received here in Vandalia, as a donation from the General",
      "Government? Depend upon it, the idea of realizing such immense sums of money in this",
      "way, is all an illusion.—As for the unconstitutionality of agitating this question",
      "at present, he hardly expected that those who bring forward a series of plans, of",
      "the same general nature with this now in progress at Springfield, would throw upon",
      "their opponents this charge; for each and all of these is equally unconstitutional. TheHon, Speakerthen rose, and read the state of the votes given for the different proposed points,",
      "when the question was submitted to the people; by which it appeared, thatAltonhad the highest number of votes, Vandalia the second highest number, while Springfield",
      "was third on the list, and was actually in a minority of several hundred. Have the",
      "sentiments of the people at large undergone a change since that time?12Of 24,000 votes then polled, Springfield had but 7,730; and of course had something",
      "like 17,000 against her. It is admitted that some of the northern counties have since",
      "that period increased in population in a greater ratio than the southern ones; but",
      "it does not follow of course, that the friends of Springfield have been multiplied",
      "in the same proportion. Now some of the northern counties, asCook,Joe Davis,Warren,PeoriaandTazewell, at that time, gave a majority of their votes against Springfield, and in favor of",
      "some other place. There are now some 40,000 voters; and perhaps, were they now consulted,",
      "they could suit themselves better than at Springfield. The House in which we are",
      "now convened, no one will deny, is sufficiently large for our accommodation; but when",
      "the legislature becomes too large to be received within its walls, and a new capitol",
      "is to be built, let the change take place without causing additional expense to the",
      "State. It has been triumphantly asked, how many State Houses were built with the",
      "proceeds of sales of the land, donated byCongressfor the benefit of the Capitol here at Vandalia. He would answer the gentleman;",
      "two had been built;—a temporary one, which had given place to this that we now occupy.",
      "But, it must be recollected, that when that donation was made, and that land sold,",
      "Illinois had a population of only 10,000 votes south of this parallel, and Vandalia",
      "was a frontier settlement. Lots therefore went low;—so low, that a law was subsequently",
      "passed for the relief of the purchasers. But, times have improved; and if a new location",
      "of the seat of government were now made,—at some central point, convenient of access",
      "to all portions of the State, and with an eye to those conveniences of approach which",
      "will be furnished by our contemplated Rail-roads, the scheme of raising a revenue",
      "from the sale of its lots would be more promising. Springfield could not probably",
      "at present accommodate the General Assembly much better than Vandalia does; and it",
      "is doubtful whether it could in ten years to come; and even here, we are growing better,",
      "and shall every year furnish more comfortable quarters to the members of the Legislature.",
      "Let Vandalia continue, then, to be the seat of government, till the interests of the",
      "country absolutely require its removal, and then he would be willing to see the change",
      "made. He made other remarks, which our limits oblige us to omit. The question being taken",
      "on his amendment, was decided in the negative. TheHon. Speakerthen rose, and said, that at the risk of being tenacious, he would introduce another",
      "amendment, the leading provisions of which, were to submit the question of location",
      "again to the people; and if there should be no choice, to return to the people thefiveplaces, having the highest number of votes, to be voted upon again. If no choice",
      "among these, then thethreehighest the second time returned from the people, to be voted upon by them the third",
      "time. If no choice, then the election to be made between the two highest the third",
      "time returned. The question being taken, this proposition was rejected.13"

It might be on a somewhat more liberal scale, than\n               the building in which he now had the honor to speak; but it was not magnificent, compared\n               with the advantage to be gained; for, if it cost four times as much, it would, he\n               expected, be four times as good. Is it magnificent in comparison with our system of\n               Internal Improvments? No! For his own part, he hoped that both would answer the wishes\n               and expectations of their most sanguine friends.  The State is now somewhat richer\n               than she was in the days of the Wiggins loan.  Then, she was unable to pay her debts;\n               now, she is able, and he hoped, willing to consult for her dignity.  The State House\n               now in progress of construction, is not on too large a scale for our prospects with\n               respect to Illinois; nor for the accommodation of the Legislature, nor the actual\n               resources of the State.  He hoped the House, in fixing the seat of Government at Springfield,\n               would bear in mind, that they were probably fixing it there for many years.  That\n               principle in human nature, which is constantly urging removal, and exciting to change,\n               however allowable in individuals, should not be indulged in legislation.  Before the\n               last session of the Legislature, indeed, it would have been premature to fix the seat\n               of Government permanently; but now, we know about where the centre of the popoulation\n               of the State of Illinois, will fall and remain for a long time to come, and what are\n               to be     her now dawning glories, when fully risen; so that, when this question is\n               once more settled, probably it will be settled, if not forever, at least for a hundred\n               years to come.  He then adverted to the taste and judgment exhited[exhibited] in the plan of the work, and in so much of the work itself as is already executed—the\n               natural advantages of Springfield and its vicinity—its facilities of access, and its\n               healthfulness; and contended that no other point could be found, combining so many\n               advantages, any where near the centre of the State.  Now, it is these that make towns,\n               not thefiatof Legislatures.  The wealth and fashion that may assemble at the seat of government,\n               during the session of the General Assembly, will neither make nor support a town,\n               though they may aid.  Nor can you at once create a city by laying off lots, and advertising\n               them for sale; for, wealth and enterprise will go where business is to be done.  There\n               is no board of commissioners whose designation of a capital would satisfy the people\n               of a whole State; this is a duty that can be performed by the people alone; and it\n               has been done by the people of Illinois, acting through their representatives.  A\n               site has been chosen, which is convenient of access; and the money of its inhabitants\n               has been received in aid of the work.9Why should the fixed plan of the State be now changed! The feeling which would prompt\n               this course of legislation today, may prompt a different course to-morrow; and what\n               security could the citizens of any place have, that you would not abandon them, after\n               making great sacrifices on the implied good faith of the State?—What could satisfy\n               them, save some fixed contract, that the members of the Legislature were not a vacillating,\n               money-shaving set, willing at any time to change the location of the capital, through\n               the influence of mere sectional or party  feeling? Rather, now, let the State continue\n               true to her pervious determination, to her plighted faith; and, though she had made\n               a less desirable place her choice, let her consider herself as sacredly bound to abide\n               by it, so long as there is a place to sustain the walls of the capitol. But when,\n               in process of time, our fruitful soil, teeming everywhere with the waving wreath of\n               the husbandman, and our three millions of citizens shall make ours the first State\n               in the Union, and the current of emigration shall have made the north by far the most\n               populous section   of Illinois,then, let the seat of government go northward too; and there let it be fixed forever.10In favoring the location at Springfield now, he endeavored, for his own part, to\n               keep clear of local prejudices, and he hoped that other gentlemen would do so; and\n               give their vote for that place, not for the sake of Sangamon county, but because that\n               would best subserve the interests of the whole people, without suffering anyad captandumproject to prevail against it."

True, the inhabitants of Vandalia\n               had a right to retain the seat of government here twenty years, according to the provisions\n               of the Constitution; but, on the other hand, if the people of Illinois at large had\n               found that they had a hard bargain, they have a right to get out of it as soon as\n               they can.  Has not the corporation of Springfield faithfully performed her part of\n               the contract? Two thirds of the stipulated sum is paid; and for the other third which\n               is not paid, thebondsof twenty-five responsible men are put forward, which may be sued at any time, and\n               are perfectly secure, so far as the interest of the State is involved.  He could not\n               say, indeed, with his colleague, that he consideredthe faith of the State as pledgedto complete the State House at Springfield; but wished that work to go on, and that\n               place to be made the permanent seat of government; because it was the place of his\n               residence, and because he really believed that the people would thus be best accommodated.\n               True, when the question of a Capitol was formerly submitted to the people at large,\n               Springfield did not receive the highest number of votes; but this can furnish no evidence\n               that if the question were now a second time submitted to the same tribunal, Springfield\n               would not have a larger vote than any other point."

Have the\n               sentiments of the people at large undergone a change since that time?12Of 24,000 votes then polled, Springfield had but 7,730; and of course had something\n               like 17,000 against her.  It is admitted that some of the northern counties have since\n               that period increased in population in a greater ratio than the southern ones; but\n               it does not follow of course, that the friends of Springfield have been multiplied\n               in the same proportion.  Now some of the northern counties, asCook,Joe Davis,Warren,PeoriaandTazewell, at that time, gave a majority of their votes against Springfield, and in favor of\n               some other place.  There are now some 40,000 voters; and perhaps, were they now consulted,\n               they could suit themselves better than at Springfield.  The House in which we are\n               now convened, no one will deny, is sufficiently large for our accommodation; but when\n               the legislature becomes too large to be received within its walls, and a new capitol\n               is to be built, let the change take place without causing additional expense to the\n               State.  It has been triumphantly asked, how many State Houses were built with the\n               proceeds of  sales of the land, donated byCongressfor the benefit of the Capitol here at Vandalia.  He would answer the gentleman;\n               two had been built;—a temporary one, which had given place to this that we now occupy.\n               But, it must be recollected, that when that donation was made, and that land sold,\n               Illinois had a population of only 10,000 votes south of this parallel, and Vandalia\n               was a frontier settlement.  Lots therefore went low;—so low, that a law was subsequently\n               passed for the relief of the purchasers.  But, times have improved; and if a new location\n               of the seat of government were now made,—at some central point, convenient of access\n               to all portions of the State, and with an eye to those conveniences of approach which\n               will be furnished by our contemplated Rail-roads, the scheme of raising a revenue\n               from the sale of its lots would be more promising.  Springfield could not probably\n               at present accommodate the General Assembly much better than Vandalia does; and it\n               is doubtful whether it could in ten years to come; and even here, we are growing better,\n               and shall every year furnish more comfortable quarters to the members of the Legislature.\n               Let Vandalia continue, then, to be the seat of government, till the interests of the\n               country absolutely require its removal, and then he would be willing to see the change\n               made."
