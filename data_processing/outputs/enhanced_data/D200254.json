        "text": "1Thebillbeing considered was part of theIllinois General Assembly’s moves, which began in the special session of 1839-40, to dismantle theInternal Improvement System, which had floundered under the economic conditions accompanying thePanic of 1837and left the state on the verge of bankruptcy.On December 16, 1840, theHouse of Representativesadopted a resolution instructing the Committee on Public Accounts and Expenditures\n                  to investigate the wisdom of establishing a board of auditors to settle the accounts\n                  of contractors involved in public works. In response to this resolution, Joseph W.\n                  Ormsbee of the Committee on Public Accounts and Expenditures introducedHB 45in the House on December 21. On December 22, the House amended the first section,\n                  referring the bill as amended to the Committee on the Judiciary. The Committee on\n                  the Judiciary reported back the bill on January 13, 1841, with amendments. The House\n                  refused to table the bill and proposed amendments by a vote of 31 yeas to 42 nays,\n                  with Abraham Lincoln not voting. On January 14, the House referred the bill and proposed\n                  amendments to the Committee on Finance, on which sat Lincoln. The Committee on Finance\n                  reported back the bill on January 22 with a substitute. The House tabled a motion\n                  to amend the fifth section by a vote of 64 yeas to 23 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.\n                  On January 23, the House amended the substitute by adding a proviso, but refused to\n                  strike out the fifth section by a vote of 29 yeas to 58 nays, with Lincoln voting\n                  nay. The House further tabled an amendment to the fifth section by a vote of 46 yeas\n                  to 39 nays, with Lincoln voting yea. The House agreed to add an additional section\n                  by a vote of 44 yeas to 41 nays, with Lincoln voting yea. The House then rejected\n                  the Committee of Finance’s substitute as amended, referring the bill and proposed\n                  amendments to a select committee. The select committee reported back the bill on January\n                  28 with amendments, in which the House concurred.  Consideration of thebillresumed on February 4.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G. A., 123, 138, 148, 149, 219, 223, 264, 267-69, 293, 299, 324-25; John\n                     H.
