No other account of Lincoln’s speech has been located.According to theIndependent, the meeting attracted a large crowd, which the newspaper estimated to be in the\n                  range of 8,000 to 10,000 spectators.  The portion of the article preceding this excerpt\n                  additionally summarizes speeches byBurton C. CookandJoseph Knox.Although theIndependentdid not specify the political leanings of this gathering, a brief article on the\n                  meeting in theIllinois State Journaldescribed it as a meeting in support ofJohn C. FremontandWilliam H. Bissell, theRepublicancandidates for U.S. president and governor ofIllinoisin theelection of 1856.  From July 1856 onwards Lincoln gave over fifty speeches across Illinois in support\n                  of Fremont and to rally the disparate elements of the emerging Republican Party.

        "text": "4This summary conflates theLand Ordinance of 1784and theNorthwest Ordinance of 1787. As a member of the Confederation Congress in 1784,Thomas Jeffersondrafted a deed of conveyance by whichVirginiaceded the land it had claimed northwest of theOhio River. Following the Confederation Congress’s acceptance of Virginia’s cession, it passed\n                  the Land Ordinance of 1784 to codify how this and similar territorial cessions would\n                  be organized and governed. Jefferson’s draft of the ordinance included the condition\n                  that after 1800 slavery would be outlawed in these territories except as punishment\n                  for crimes, but this provision was removed by amendment during congressional debate.The Land Ordinance of 1784 was ultimately succeeded by the Northwest Ordinance of\n                  1787. The Northwest Ordinance  organized theNorthwest Territory, which included the land of what would become the states listed here, along with\n                  a portion of the future state ofMinnesota. Among the ordinance’s provisions for governing the Northwest Territory was a clause\n                  prohibiting slavery in the territory and in any states that might arise from it except\n                  as a punishment for crime.Julian P.
