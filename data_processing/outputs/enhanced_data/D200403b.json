It is true\n\nthat in early life I was inclined to believe in what I understand is called the “Doctrine\n\nof Necessity”—that is, that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest\n\nby some power, over which the mind itself has no control; and I have sometimes (with\n\none, two or three, but never publicly) tried to maintain this opinion in argument.\n\nThe habit of arguing thus, however, I have entirely left off for more than five years.\n\nAnd I add here, I have always understood this same opinion to be held by several of\n\nthe Christian denominations. The foregoing, is the whole truth, briefly stated, in\n\nrelation to myself, upon this subject. I do not think I could myself, be brought to support a man for office, whom I knew\n\nto be an open enemy of, and scoffer at religion. Leaving the higher matter of eternal\n\nconsequences, between him and his maker, I still do not think any man has the right\n\nthus to insult the feelings, and injure the morals of the community in which he may\n\nlive. If, then, I was guilty of such conduct, I should blame no man who should condemn\n\nme for it; but I do blame those, whoever they may be, who falsely put such a charge\n\nin circulation against me.",
