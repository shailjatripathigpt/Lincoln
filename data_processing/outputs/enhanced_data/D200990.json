        "text": "2The “new land” Lincoln references was created as a result of U.S. government improvements\n                  to theChicago Riverin the 1830s. Between 1833 and 1835, U.S. government engineers cut a channel two\n                  hundred feet wide and three to seven feet deep across a sand bar at the mouth of the\n                  river that obstructed navigation. This gave Chicago a true harbor on Lake Michigan,\n                  permitting ships to navigate up the Chicago River, but sand accumulated continuously\n                  behind the river’s north pier. Over time, as a result of this sand accumulation, the\n                  north pier extended nearly three-quarters of a mile out into Lake Michigan, creating\n                  the new land Lincoln discusses in this letter.William Cronon,Nature’s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West(New York: W. W. Norton, 1991), 56."

        "text": "3Robert A. Kinzie’s reply has not been located. Lincoln received at least five more\n                  letters related to this legal case.Lincoln’s questions to Kinzie are related to the caseJohnston v. Jones & Marsh, which was also known at the time as the “sand-bar case.” William S. Johnston owned\n                  a lakefront lot in Chicago adjoining a lakefront lot owned by William Jones and Sylvester\n                  Marsh.  Both lots bordered Lake Michigan; neither bordered the Chicago River.  After\n                  the U. S. government’s improvements to the Chicago River from 1833 to 1835 cut a channel\n                  across both lots, sand washed up against the new pier and old shoreline and created\n                  new land more than 1,000 feet wide.  In July 1849, Johnston sued Jones and Marsh in\n                  theUnited States Circuit Court, District of Illinoisan action of ejectment from six acres of the accreted land.   In American law, “ejectment”\n                  relates to an action to recover land or other real property and to collect damages.\n                  Johnston claimed that after the U.S. government built the new channel, his property\n                  continued to border Lake Michigan, entitling him to the new land.  Jones and Marsh\n                  claimed that Johnston no longer had a lakefront border and was not entitled to any\n                  of the new land. After multiple continuances and trials, a jury ruled in favor of\n                  Johnston. Jones and Marsh appealed to theU. S. Supreme Court, and in January 1856, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s ruling and remanded\n                  the case back to theU.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois.Johnston continued the ejectment case, and both parties engaged new attorneys.  Jones\n                  and Marsh retained Lincoln as one of their attorneys. In April 1860, a jury in the\n                  U.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois ruled in favor of Jones and Marsh.\n                  In July 1860, Johnston appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court, which, in February 1862,\n                  found no error and affirmed the lower court’s judgment in favor of Jones and Marsh.\n                  Ogden, Fleetwood and Company, which had some interest in the property, paid Lincoln $350 for his legal services\n                  in the case.Samuel W.
