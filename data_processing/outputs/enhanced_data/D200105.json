This thing of living in Springfield is rather a dull business after all, at least\n\nit is so to me.2I am quite as lonesome here as ever was anywhere in my life.

Whatever woman may cast\n\nher lot with mine should any ever do so, it is my intention to do all in my power\n\nto make her happy and contented; and there is nothing I can immagine, that would make\n\nme more unhappy than to fail in the effort. I know I should be much happier with\n\nyou than the way I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you. What<Page 2>you have said to me may have been in jest, or I may have misunderstood it. If so,\n\nthen let it be forgotten; if otherwise, I much wish you would think seriously before\n\nyou decide. For my part I have already decided. What I have said I will most positively\n\nabide by, provided you wish it. My opinion is, that you had better not do it. You\n\nhave not been accustomed to hardship, and it may be more severe than you now immagine. I know you are capable of thinking correctly on any subject; and if you deliberate\n\nmaturely upon this, before you decide, then I am willing to abide your decision.
