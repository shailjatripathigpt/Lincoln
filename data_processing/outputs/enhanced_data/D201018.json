        "text": "3Lincoln wrote this opinion while offering legal advice to William B. Warren. Warren\n                  had sold land to an individual known as Bennett, who then abandoned the property.\n                  A man claiming to be a creditor of Bennett then removed the fence planks that Bennett\n                  had added to the land. Warren contacted Lincoln to determine if there was any legal\n                  action that could be taken against the plank remover.In American law, replevin is “an action to recover the plaintiff's personal property\n                  that the defendant refused to return.” Lincoln is advising Warren that charging the\n                  supposed creditor with trespassing would be legally sound, as well as demanding the\n                  return of the planks if possible.It is unknown if Warren followed Lincoln's advice and sued the unknown creditor in\n                  either an action of trespass or replevin.Lincoln provided legal advice to Warren, Martha L.
