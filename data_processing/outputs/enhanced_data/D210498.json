Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere among the early contestants. Abraham Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.As competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position.On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19.
