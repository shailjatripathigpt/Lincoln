The manuscript ends abruptly with an unfinished\n                  sentence.Editors of early collections of Lincoln papers disagreed over the date and title of\n                  this document.  John Nicolay and John Hay in theComplete Works of Abraham Lincolnentitled it “Fragment. Notes for a Lecture,” and assigned it the inferred date of\n                  July 1, 1850 without attribution.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, and his colleagues rejected Nicolay’s and Hay’s date “because the editors can find\n                  no reason for so dating it.”  Basler also replaced “Fragment. Notes for a Lecture”\n                  with “Fragment: Niagara Falls.”  Basler assigned the document the date range of September\n                  25-30, 1848 based on two principal facts: (1) Lincoln visited Niagara Falls  en route\n                  fromBostontoChicagoafter completing a speaking tour inMassachusettson behalf ofZachary Taylorin thepresidential election of 1848; (2) the handwriting and paper used appears contemporary with Lincoln letters and\n                  speeches written in 1848 while serving in theHouse of Representatives.  The editors have found no evidence to substantiate Nicolay’s and Hay’s date.  Various\n                  sources claim that Lincoln visited Niagara Falls on his trip from Boston to Chicago,\n                  andWilliam H. Herndonrecounts a story where he and Lincoln spoke about the experience.  TheLincoln Logfixes the date for the visit on September 28, but provides no evidence to substantiate\n                  this assertion, so the editors have used Basler’s inferred date.John G.
