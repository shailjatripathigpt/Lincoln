The sum of pro-slavery theology seems to be this: \"Slavery is not universallyright, nor yet universallywrong; it is better forsomepeople to be slaves; and, in such cases, it is the Will of God that they be such–\" Certainly there is no contending against the Will of God; but still there is some\n\ndifficulty in ascertaining,it,and applying it, to particular cases– For instance we will suppose the Rev.DrRosshas a slave named Sambo, and the question is \"Is it the Will of God that Sambo shall\n\nremain a slave, or be set free?2The Almighty gives no audable answer to the question, and his revelation— the Bible— gives none—^or, at most, none but such as admits of a squabble, as to it's meaning–^No one thinks of asking Sambo'soppopinion on it– So, at last, it comes to this; thatDrRevRossis to decide the question– And while he considers it, he sits in the shade, with\n\ngloves on his hands, and subsists on the bread that Sambo is earning in the burning\n\nsun– If he decides that God Wills Sambo to continue a slave, he thereby retains his\n\nown comfortable position; but if he decides that God Will's Sambo to be free, he thereby has to walk out of the shade, throw off his gloves,\n\nand delve for his own bread– Will DrRoss be actuated by that perfect impartiality, which has ever been considered most\n\nfavorable to correct decisions?<Page 2>But, slavery is good for some people!!! As agoodthing, slavery is strikingly perculiar, in this, that it is the only good thingthat^which^no man ever seeks the good of,forhimself– Nonsense!

        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote this fragment.The actual date of this fragment is unknown.  Scholars agree that Lincoln  penned\n                  this in response to Frederick A. Ross, a pro-slavery clergyman and theologian who\n                  publishedSlavery Ordained of Godin 1857.John G. NicolayandJohn M. Hayassigned it the date October 1, 1858, and included it among a number of fragments\n                  and notes for speeches that Lincoln delivered during the1858 senatorial campaignagainstStephen A. Douglas.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, retained this date in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.     Rufus Rockwell\n                  Wilson insisted that Lincoln readSlavery Ordained of God, and used Ross’ views of the divine will to compose material for use during theLincoln-Douglas Debates.  Modern scholars doubt whether Lincoln actually read the book but agree that Ross’\n                  views had some impact on Lincoln’s thought.  Ross publishedSlavery Ordained of Godin May 1857, so the editors believe that Lincoln penned this sometime between May\n                  1857 and October 1858.Fred. A.
