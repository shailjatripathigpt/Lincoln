Harmon actually\n                  wrote Lincoln two letters in 1858 prior to September 3:oneon August 23 andanotheron September 1. Hiram BeckwithwroteLincoln on August 31. In their letters, both Harmon and Beckwith requested that Lincoln\n                  come to Danville, Illinois, or at least some place withinVermilion County, Illinois, to deliver a public address in support of theRepublicancause. At the time Lincoln was running as the Republican Party’s candidate to replace\n                  incumbentDemocratStephen A. Douglas in theU.S. Senate. Because members of theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, both Lincoln and Douglas\n                  were highly attuned to local races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senateduring thecampaign of 1858.

        "text": "3For the first part of the election campaign of 1858, Lincoln often followed Douglas\n                  on the  trail, delivering speeches either later in the evening after Douglas finished,\n                  or the next day. In early August, Lincoln noted in correspondence to multiple recipients\n                  that Douglas had indicated that “my presence, on the days or evenings of his meetings\n                  would be considered an intrusion.” He nevertheless continued scheduling public addresses\n                  following Douglas for some time, although he also publicly challenged Douglas to a\n                  series of debates, which Douglas eventually accepted and which became the renownedLincoln-Douglas Debates.Tensions ran high among each candidate’s supporters, and the close proximity of Lincoln’s\n                  speeches to Douglas’s sometimes nearly led these tensions to spill over. A brawl almost\n                  erupted inSullivan, Illinois, on September 20, for instance, when the two men’s speeches nearly overlapped and\n                  their supporters crossed paths while delivering Lincoln to a rally. Persons unknown\n                  also vandalized a carriage provided for Douglas “in a manner unmentionable” the eve\n                  before his Danville address. Douglas gave his speech in Danville on September 21,\n                  as scheduled. Lincoln also delivered a speech in Danville, on September 22, as scheduled,\n                  after staying at Fithian’s home the previous evening.InIllinois’s local elections of 1858, Republicans ultimately won a majority of all votes cast\n                  in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly\n                  and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however, and\n                  in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained\n                  recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:483-85, 556-57;Abraham Lincoln to Jediah F.
