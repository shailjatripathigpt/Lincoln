        "text": "5In the1856 Federal Election, theDemocratic Partynominated James Buchanan to head its presidential ticket.   Republicans gathered\n                  for theirfirst national conventioninPhiladelphiaand considered John McLean and other candidates before nominatingJohn C. Fremont. Buchanan defeated Fremont  to become the fifteenth president of the United States.Buchanan captured Illinois with 44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont\n                  and 15.7 forMillard Fillmore, candidate for theAmerican Party.    Washburne was correct in his assessment of the northern part of Illinois: voters\n                  in the four northern congressional districts sent Republicans to theU.S. House of Representatives, including Washburne in the First Congressional District.  Washburne was also right\n                  to be concerned with southern Illinois: voters in the five congressional districts\n                  in that part of the state sentDemocratsthe U.S. House.  Illinoisans from southern Illinois also went overwhelmingly for\n                  Buchanan. Voters in the eighteen counties in the Ninth Illinois Congressional District,\n                  which encompassed most of southern Illinois, gave Buchanan 71 percent of the votes\n                  to 25 percent for Fillmore and only 4 percent for Fremont.William E. Gienapp,The Origins of the Republican Party 1852-1856(New York: Oxford University Press, 1987), 307-8; David M. Potter and Don E.
