In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.In the state elections of 1858,  Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-Stephen A. DouglasDemocratsretained control of the Illinois General Assembly and reelectedDouglas, the incumbent, to the U.S. Senate.  In elections to the Illinois House, Edgar County\n                  give its one seat to RepublicanRobert Moseley, who defeatedCharles Summers, hisDemocraticopponent, by fifty-three votes. Sangamon, Morgan, and Madison counties each had two\n                  seats up for election, and the Democratic candidatesJames W. Barrett(Sangamon), Daniel Short (Sangamon),Cyrus Epler(Morgan),Elisha B. Hitt(Morgan/Scott),Zephaniah B. Job(Madison), andJoseph H. Sloss(Madison) easily out-polled their Republican challengers.    In the Illinois Senate,Cyrus R. Vanderen, a member of theAmerican Partyelected to represent Sangamon and Morgan counties in 1856, held over in 1858.   \n                  RepublicanThomas A. Marshalldefeated DemocratUsher F. Linderto representColes,Cumberland, Edgar, andVermilioncounties. In the senatorial election held on January 5, 1859, Barrett, Short, Epler,\n                  Hitt, Job, and Sloss voted for Douglas; Moseley, Vanderen, and Marshall voted for\n                  Lincoln.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-85, 546-47, 557; Allen\n                     C.

        "text": "3Despite Lincoln’s defeat, his campaign - especially hisseries of debateswith Douglas - enhanced his standing in the national Republican Party. Rives, among\n                  other Republicans in Illinois and beyond, indicated support for the idea of nominating\n                  Lincoln for president in 1860. Meanwhile, Douglas’s national reputation in the Democratic\n                  Party somewhat suffered. Earlier in 1858, Douglas’s criticism of PresidentJames Buchanan’s support for theLecompton Constitutioncaused a rift in the Democratic Party. During Douglas’s debates with Lincoln, the\n                  former’s  defense of popular sovereignty as a means of determining whether to allow\n                  slavery in U.S. territories further alienated Southern Democrats.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:553-57"
