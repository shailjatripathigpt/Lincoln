Alexander was among the delegates representing Bond County at the1858 Republican State ConventionandwroteAbraham Lincoln on August 5 asking him to change his schedule to visit Greenville\n                  on September 13. Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. See1858 Federal Election.Prior to August 20, 1858, Lincoln’s list of appointments advertised his visit to Greenville\n                  on September 11 and his visit to Edwardsville on September 12. On August 20, the dates\n                  shifted to Lincoln visiting Edwardsville on September 13. Finally, as requested in\n                  this letter, on September 3 Lincoln’s visits were advertised for a speech in Edwardsville on September 11 and aspeechin Greenville on September 13, the actual dates.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-85, 547; Allen C.

In elections for the Illinois General Assembly, DemocratSamuel A. Buckmasterfrom Madison County beatJoseph Gillespieby 184 votes in theSenaterace. The men elected to theHousein Madison County—Zephaniah B. Job(over Republican Isaac Cox) andJoseph H. Sloss(over RepublicanCurtis Blakeman) — both voted for Stephen A. Douglas for U.S. Senate in the 1858 Federal Election,\n                  as did Buckmaster.No response from Lincoln to Metcalf has been found.Bruce Collins, “The Lincoln-Douglas Contest of 1858 and Illinois’ Electorate,”Journal of American Studies20 (Dec. 1986): 408-9; Louis L.
