See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.The moralizing tone of the Republican platform to stop the spread of slavery led many\n                  German-Americans to push for the party to defend immigrants. However, the Republican\n                  Party needed both the German votes and the votes of formerAmerican Partymembers to win in 1858. These two groups possessed decidedly opposing viewpoints,\n                  with the nativism of the American Party directing its anger at immigrants such as\n                  the Germans. Lincoln was not a supporter of nativism and in alettertoJoshua F. Speedin 1855 he wrote, \"How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor\n                  of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to\n                  be pretty refined.\"Alison Clark Efford, \"Abraham Lincoln, German-Born Republicans, and\n                     American Citizenship,\"Marquette Law Review93 (Summer 2010): 1376-78."

Douglas and his opposition toelection fraudsinKansas. However, when Douglas celebrated the election of Barret, a supporter of theLecompton Constitution, the newspaper changed course. Barret had run as a regular Democratic nominee rather\n                  than as ananti-LecomptonDemocrat, prompting one newspaper to claim that this proved that Douglas’s rejection\n                  of the Lecompton Constitution, “was but a ruse to pull the wool over the eyes of Republicans\n                  andAmericans, and thus secure their votes for his reelection to the Senate.” Accusations of fraud\n                  soon appeared, and Blair contested Barret’s win. After a lengthy examination, the\n                  U.S. House ordered a new election for the remainder of Barret’s term. While Barret\n                  remained in his seat to finish out his term per the new election, Blair defeated him\n                  for the next term in office.Urbana Union(IL), 12 August 1858, 2:2;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 5 August 1858, 2:1-3;Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1996(Alexandria, VA: CQ Staff Directories, 1997), 622-23;La Grange National American(MO), 14 August 1858, 2:3; L.
