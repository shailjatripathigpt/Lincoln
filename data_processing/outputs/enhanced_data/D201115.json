        "text": "2Lincoln was running to replace incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. He arrived in Winchester on September 28, 1858 and gave a speech outside of town,\n                  then spoke at the court house in Winchester on September 29 and departed forPittsfieldthe following day.  At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf ofRepublicancandidates for the General Assembly. He and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts\n                  on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.While in Winchester, Lincoln was a guest of Linnie Haggard’s father, hotel owner\n                  Robert E. Haggard. Later in life, Linnie Haggard recollected that after her father\n                  entertained Lincoln and some prominent Republicans, Lincoln remained in the parlor\n                  with the Haggard family and upon seeing a guitar asked for some music. After Linnie\n                  played and sang for Lincoln, she and her sister requested that he sign their autograph\n                  albums.  Lincoln complied, swiftly writing original verses to each, with these lines\n                  being the inscription he produced for Linnie. Following Linnie Haggard’s death,  this\n                  inscription by Lincoln was owned by the family of one of her former students. According\n                  to the memory of this  former pupil, Linnie Haggard had told him a slightly variant\n                  story of the origin  of these lines in which Linnie and her sisters  were playing\n                  the guitar and singing in the parlor of their father’s hotel after their work was\n                  done. In this version of the story, several guests, including Lincoln, were on the\n                  porch as the Haggard sisters performed, and Lincoln came in from the porch where he\n                  had been listening to ask that they sing again. After receiving his thanks, the girls\n                  requested that he sign their autograph books.
