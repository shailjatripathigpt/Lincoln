    "full_text": "Speech in United States House of Representatives regarding Internal Improvements,\n\n1 In committee of the whole on the state of the union, on thecivil and diplomatic appropriation bill– MrChairman2 I wish at all times in no way to practice any fraud upon theHouseor the committee, and I also desire to do nothing which may be very disagreeable\n\nto any of the members–. I therefore state in advance that my object in taking the\n\nfloor is to make a speech on the general subject of internal improvements; and if\n\nI am out of order in doing so, I give the chair an oppertunity of so deciding, and I will take my seat– The chair; I will not undertake to anticipate what the gentleman may on the subject\n\nof internal improvements,– He will, therefore, proceed in his remarks, and if any\n\nquestion of order shall be made, the chair will then decide it– MrLincoln: At an early day of this session thepresidentsent us what may properly be called an internal improvement veto message–3The latedemocraticconvention which sat atBaltimore, and whichnominated Gen: Cass for the presidency, adopted a set of resolutions, now called the democratic platform, among which is\n\none in these words: \"That the constitution does not confer upon the general government the power to commence,\n\nand carry on a general system of internal improvements\"4 Gen: Cass, in his letter accepting the nomination, holds this language: \"I have carefully read the resolutions of the Democratic National convention, laying\n\ndown the platform of our political faith, and I adhere to them as firmly, as I approve\n\nthem cordially\"–5 These things, taken together, show that the question of internal improvements is now more distinctly made—has become more intense—than at any former period– It can no\n\nlonger be avoided– The veto message, and the Baltimore resolution, I understand to\n\nbe, in substance, the same thing; the latter being the mere general statement, ofwhat^which^the former is thespecification^amplification—^—the bill of particulars– While I know there are many democrats, on this floor and\n\nelsewhere, who disapprove that message, I understand that all who shall vote for Gen:\n\nCass, will thereafter be counted ashashaving approved it—as having endorsed all it's doctrines– I suppose all, or nearly\n\nall the democrats will vote for him– Many of them will do so, not because they like\n\nhis position on this question, but because they prefer him, being wrong in this, to\n\nanother whom they consider farther wrong on other other questions– In this way, the internal improvement democrats are to be, by a sort of\n\nforced consent, carried over, and swayed against themselves on this measure of policy–\n\nGen: Cass, once elected, will not trouble himself to make a constitutional argument,\n\nor, perhaps, any argument at all, when he shall veto a river or harbor bill; he will\n\nconsider it a sufficient answer to all democratic murmers, to point to MrPolk's message, and^to^the \"democratic platform\"– This being the case, the question of improvements is verging\n\nto a final crisis; and the friends of the policy must now battle, and battle manfully,\n\nor surrender all– In this view, humble as I am, I wish to review, and contest as well\n\nas I may, the general positions of this veto message– When I saygeneralpositions, I mean to exclude from consideration so much as relates to the present\n\nembarrassed state of the Treasury in consequence of theMexican war– Those general positions are: That internal improvements ought not to be made by the\n\ngeneral govern- ment– 1– Because they would overwhelm the Treasury– 2– Because, while theirburthenswould be general, theirbenefitswould belocalandpartial; involving an obnoxious inequality—and 3– Because they would be unconstitutional– That the 4– Because the states may do enough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties—or\n\nif not 5– That the constitution may be amended– \"Do nothing at all, lest you do something wrong\" is the sum of these positions—is the sum of this message– And this, with the exception\n\nof what is said about constitutionality, applying as forcibly to making improvements\n\nby state authority, as by the national authority– So that we must abandon the improvements\n\nof the country^altogether,^by any, and every authority, or we must resist, and repudiate the doctrines of this\n\nmessage– Let us attempt the latter– The first position is, that a system of internal improvements would overwhelm the\n\ntreasury– That, in such a system there is atendencyto undue expansion, is not to be denied– Such tendency is founded in the nature of\n\nthe subject– A member ofcongresswill prefer voting for a bill which contains an appropriation for his district, to\n\nvoting for one which does not; and when a bill shall be expanded till every district\n\nshall be provided for, that it will be too greatly expanded, is obvious– But is this\n\nany more true in congress, than in a state legislature? If a member of congress must\n\nhave an appropriation for his district, so, a member of a legislature must have one\n\nfor his county– And if one will overwhelm the national treasury, so the other will\n\noverwhelm the state treasury– Go where we will, the difficulty is the same– Allow\n\nit to drive us from the halls of congress, and it will, just as easily, drive us from\n\nthe state legislaturesLet us, then, grapple with it, and test it's strength– Let us, judging of the future by the past, ascertain whether there may not be, in the discretion\n\nof congress, a sufficient power to limit, and restrain this expansive tendency, within\n\nreasonable, and proper bounds– The president himself values the evidence of the past–\n\nHe tells us that at a certain point of our history, more than two hundred millions\n\nof dollars had been,appliedfor, to make improvements; and this he does to prove that the treasury would be overwhelmed\n\nby such a system. Why did he not tell us how much wasgranted? Would not that have been better evidence? Let us turn to it, and see what it proves–\n\nIn the message, the president tells us that \"During the four succeeding years, embraced by the administration ofpresident Adams, the power not only to appropriate money, but to apply it, under the direction and\n\nauthority of the General Government, as well to the construction of roads, as to the\n\nimprovement of harbors and rivers, was fully asserted and exercised\"7 This, then, was the period of greatest enormity– These, if any, must have been the\n\ndays of the two hundred millions– And how much do you suppose was really expended\n\nfor improvements, during that four years? Two hundred millions? One hundred? Fifty?\n\nTen? Five? No sir, less than two millions– As shown by authentic documents, the expenditures\n\non improvements, during 1825 1826– 1827 and 1828, amounted to $1–879–627–01– These\n\nfour years were the period of MrAdams' administration, nearly, and substantially– This fact shows, that when the\n\npower to make improvements \"was fully asserted and exercised\"8the congressesdidkeep within reasonable limits; and what has been done, it seems to me, can be done\n\nagain– Now for the second position of the message, namely, that the burthens of improvements\n\nwould begeneral, while theirbenefitswouldlocalandpartial, involving an obnoxious inequality– That there is some degree of truth in this position,\n\nI shall not deny– No com- mercial object of government patronage can be so exclusivelygeneral, as to not be of some peculiarlocaladvantage; but, on the other hand, nothing is solocal, as to not be of some general advantage– TheNavy, as I understand it, was established, and is maintained at a great annual expense,\n\npartly to be ready for war when war shall come, but partly also, and perhaps chiefly,\n\nfor the protection of our commerce on the high seas– This latter object is, for all\n\nI can see, in principle, the same as internal improvements– The driving a pirate from\n\nthe track of commerce on the broad ocean, and the removing a snag from it's more narrow\n\npath in theMississippi river, can not, I think, be distinguished in principle– Each is done to save life and\n\nproperty, and for nothing else– The Navy then, is the most general in it's benefits of all this class of objects;\n\nand yet even the Navy is of some peculiar advantage toCharleston, Baltimore,Philadelphia,New-YorkandBoston, beyond what it is to the interior towns ofIllinois– The next most general object I can think of would be improvements on the Mississippi\n\nriver and it's tributaries– They touch thirteen of our states,Pennsylvania,Virginia,Kentucky,Tennessee,Mississippi,Louisiana,Arkansas,Missouri, Illinois,Indiana,Ohio,WisconsinandIowa– Now I suppose it will not be denied, that these thirteen states are a little more\n\ninterested in improvements on that great river, than are the remaining seventeen–\n\nThese instances of the Navy, and the Mississippi river, show clearly that there is\n\nsomething of local advantage in the most general objects– But the converse is also\n\ntrue– Nothing is solocalas to not be of somegeneralbenefit– Take, for instance, theIllinois and Michigan canal– Considered apartfromfrom it's effects, it is perfectly local– Every inch of it is within the state of\n\nIllinois– That canal was first opened for business last April– In a very few days\n\nwe were all gratified to learn, among other things, that sugar had been carried fromNew-Orleansthrough this canal toBuffaloinNew-York– This sugar took this route, doubtless because it was cheaper than the old route–\n\nSupposing the benefit of the reduction in the cost of carriage to be shared between\n\nseller and buyer, the result is, that the New Orleans merchant sold his sugar a littledearer, and the people of Buffalo sweetened their coffee a littlecheaper, than before—a benefit resultingfromthe canal, not to Illinois where the canalis, but to Louisiana and New-York where it isnot– In other transactions Illinois will, of course, have her share, and perhaps the\n\nlarger share too, in the benefits of the canal; but the instance of the sugar clearly\n\nshows that thebenefitsof an improvement, are by no means confined to the particular locality of the improvement\n\nitself– The just conclusion from all this is, that if the nation refuse to make improvements,\n\nof the more general kind, becausetheirtheir benefits may be somewhat local, a state may, for the same reason, refuse to\n\nmake an improvement of a local kind, because, it's benefits may be somewhat general–The^A^statesmay well say to the nation \"If you will do nothing for me, I will do nothing for you–\" Thus it is seen, that if this argument of \"inequality\" is sufficient any where,isit is sufficient every where; and puts an end to improvementsalthaltogether– I hope and believe, that if both the nation and the states would, in\n\ngood faith, in their respective spheres, do what they could in the way of improvements,\n\nwhat of inequality might be produced in one place, might be compensated in another,\n\nand that the sum of the whole might not be very unequal– But suppose, after all, there should be some degree of inequality– Inequality is certainly\n\nnever to be embraced for it's own sake; but is every good thing to be discarded, which\n\nmay be inseparably connected with some degree of it? If so, we must discard all government–\n\nThis capitol is built at the public expense, for the public benefit but does any one doubt that it is of some peculiar local advantage to the property\n\nholders, and business peopeople ofWashington? Shall we remove it for this reason? and if so, where shall we set it down, and be\n\nfree from the difficulty? To make sure of our object, shall we locate it nowhere?\n\nand have congress^hereafter^to hold it's sessions, as the loafer lodged \"in spots about\"? I make no special allusion to the present president when I say there are few stranger\n\ncases in this in this world, of \"burthen to the many, and benefit to the few\"9—of \"inequality\"—than the presidency itself is by some thought to be– An honest laborer\n\ndigs coal at about seventy cents a day, while the president digs abstractions at about\n\nseventy dollars a day– Thecoalis clearly worth more than theabstractions, and yet what a monstrous inequity in the prices!– Does the president, for this reason,\n\npropose to abolish the presidency? Hedoesnot, and heoughtnot. The true rule, in determining to embrace, or reject any thing, is not whether\n\nit haveanyevil in it; but whether it have more of evil, than of good– There are few thingswhollyevil, orwhollygood– Almost every thing, especially of governmental policy, is an inseparable compound\n\nof the two; so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually\n\ndemanded– On this principle the president, his friends, and the world generally, act\n\non most subjects– Why not apply it, then, upon this question? Why, as to improvements,\n\nmagnify theevil, and stoutly refuse to see anygoodin them? MrChairman, on the third position of the message, the constitutional question, I have\n\nnot much to say– Being the man I am, and speaking when I do, I feel, that in any attempt\n\nat an original constitutional argument, I should not be, and ought not to be, listened\n\nto patiently– The ablest, and the best men, have gone over the whole ground long ago–\n\nI shall attempt but little more than a brief notice of what some of them have said– In relation to MrJeffersons views, I read from MrPolk's veto message– ⋄President Jefferson, in his message to Congress in 1806, recommended an amendment\n\nof the constitution, with a view to apply an anticipated surplus in the Treasury \"to\n\nthe great purposes of the public education, roads, rivers, canals, and such other\n\nobjects of public improvements as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional\n\nenumeration of the federal powers;\" and he adds: \"I suppose an amendment to the constitution,\n\nby consent of the States, necessary, because the objects now recommended are not among\n\nthose enumerated in the constitution, and to which it permits the public moneys to\n\nbe applied.\" In 1825, he repeated, in his published letters, the opinion that no such\n\npower has been conferred upon Congress.⋄10 I introduce this, not to controvert, just now, the constitutional opinion, but to\n\nshow that onthat^the^onthe question ofexpediency, MrJeffersons opinion was against the present president—that this opinion of MrJefferson, in one branch at least, is, in the hands of MrPolk, like McFingal's gun: \"Bears wide, and kicks the owner over\"– \"Bears wide, and kicks the owner over\"–11 But to the constitutional question– In 1826,Chancellor Kentfirst published his commentaries on American Law– He devoted a portion of one of\n\nthe lectures to the question of the authority of congress to appropriate public moneyes for internal improvements– He mentions that the question had never been brought under\n\njudicial consideration, and proceeds to give a brief summary of the discussions it\n\nhad undergone between the legislative, and executive branches of the government–\n\nHe shows that the legislative branch had usually beenfor, and the executive against the power, till the period of MrJ. Q. Adams' administration, at which point he considers the executive influence\n\nas withdrawn from opposition, and added to the support of the power– In 1844 the chancellor\n\npublished a new edition of his commentaries, in which he adds some notes of what had\n\ntranspired on the question since 1826– I have not time to read the original text,\n\nor the notes; but the whole may be found on page 267, and the two or three following\n\npages of the first volume of the edition of 1844– As what chancellor Kent seems to\n\nconsider the sum of the whole, I read from one of the notes: \"MrJustice Story, in his commentaries on the constitution of the United States, vol. 11 p 429-440,\n\nand again p 519– 538 has stated at large the arguments for and and against the proposition, that congress have a constitutional authority to lay taxes,\n\nand to apply the power to regulate commerce as a means directly to encourage and protect\n\ndomestic manufacturers; and without giving any opinion of his own on the contested\n\ndoctrine, he has left the reader to draw his own conclusions– I should think, however,\n\nfrom the arguments as stated, that every mind which has taken no part in the discussions,\n\nand felt no prejudice or teritorial bias on either side of the question, would deem the arguments in favor of the congressional\n\npower vastly superior–\"12It will seem, that in this extract the power to make improvements is not directly\n\nmentioned; but by examining the context, both of Kent and Story, it will be seen that\n\nthe power mentioned in the extract, and the power to make improvements are regarded\n\nas identical. It is not to be denied that many great and good men have beenagainstthe power; but it is insisted that quite as many, as great and as good, have beenforit; and it is shown that, on a full survey of the whole, Chancellor Kent was of opinion\n\nthat the arguments of the latter werevastlysuperior– This is but the opinion of a man, but who was that man? He was one of the\n\nablest^and most learned^lawyers of his age, or of any age–^It is no disparagement to MrPolk, nor, indeed to any one who devotes much time to politics, to be placed far\n\nbehind Chancellor Kent as a lawyer–^His attitude was most favorable to correct conclusions– He wrote coolly, and in retirement–\n\nHe was struggling to rear a durable monument of fame; and he well knew thattruthand thoroughly sound reasoning were the onlysansure foundations– Can the party opinion of a party president, on a law question,\n\nas this purely is, be at all compared, or set in in opposition to that of such a man, in such an attitude, as Chancellor Kent? This constitutional question will probably never be better settled than it is, until\n\nit shall pass under judicial con- sideration; but I do think no man, who is clear on the questions of expediency, needs\n\nfeel his conscience much pricked upon this– MrChairman, the president seems to think that enough may be done, in the way of improvements,\n\nby means of tonnage duties, under state authority, with the consent of the General\n\nGovernment– Now I suppose this matter of tonnage duties is well enough in it's own sphere– I suppose it may be efficient, and perhaps,sufficient, to make slight improvements and repairs, in harbors already in use, and not much\n\nout of repair– But if I have any correct general idea of it, it must be wholly inefficient\n\nfor any generally beneficent purposes of improvement– I know very little, or rather\n\nnothing at all, of the practical matter of levying and collecting tonnage duties;\n\nbut I suppose one of it's principles must be, to lay a duty for the improvement of any particular harbor,uponthe tonnagecomingintothatharbor– To do otherwise—to collect money inoneharbor, to be expended on improvements inanother, would be an extremelyagravated^aggravated^form of that inequality which the president so much deprecates– If I be right in\n\nthis, how could we make any entirely new improvement^by means of tonnage duties^? How make a road, a canal, or clear a greatly obstructed river? The idea that we\n\ncould, involves the same absurdity of the irish bull about the new boots—\"I shall never git em on\" says Patrick \"till I wear em a day or two, and strech em\n\na little\"13We shall never make a canal by tonnage duties, until it shall already have been made\n\nawhile, so the tonnage can get into it– After all, the presidents concludes that possibly there may be some great objects of improvements which can\n\nnot be effected by tonnage duties, and which, therefore, may be expedient for the\n\nGeneral Government to take in hand– Accordingly he suggests, in case any such be discovered,\n\nthe propriety of amending the constitution– Amend it for what? If, like MrJefferson, the president thought improvementsexpedient, but not constitutional, it would be natural enough for him to recommend such an amendment; but hear what he\n\nsays in this very message: \"In view of these portentous consequences, I can not but think that this course of\n\nlegislation should be arrested, even were there nothing to forbid it in the fundamental\n\nlaws of our union\"–14 For what, then, wouldhehave the constitution amended? Withhimit is a proposition to removeoneimpediment, merely to be met byothers, which, in his opinion, can not be removed—to enable congress to do what, in his\n\nopinion they ought not to do, if they could!– (Here MrMeadeof Virginia, enquired if MrL. understood the president to be opposed on grounds of expediency to any and every\n\nimprovement; to which MrL. answered) In the very part of his message of which I am speaking, I understand\n\nhim as giving some vague expression in favor of some possible objects of improvements;\n\nbut in doing so, I understand him to be directly on the teeth of his own arguments,\n\nin other parts of it– Neither the president, nor any one, can possibly specify an\n\nimprovement, which shall not be clearly liable to one or another of the objections\n\nhe has argued on the score of expediency– I have shown, and might show again, that\n\nno work—no object—can be so general, as to dispense it's benefits with precise equality; and this inequality, is chief among the \"portentous consequences\" for which hedeclares^declares^that improvements should be arrested– No sir, when the president intimates that something,\n\nin the way of improvements, may properly be done by the General Government, he is\n\nshrinking from the conclusions to which his own arguments would force him– He feels\n\nthat the improvements of this broad and goodly land, are a mighty interest; and he\n\nis unwilling to confess to the people, or perhaps to himself, that he has built an\n\nargument which, when pressed to it's conclusions, entirely anihilates this interest– I have already said that no one, who is satisfied of the expediency of making improvements,\n\nneeds be much uneasy in his conscience about it's constitutionality– I wish now to\n\nsubmit a few remarks on the general proposition of amending the constitution– As a\n\ngeneral rule, I think, we would much better let it alone– No slight occasion should\n\ntempt us to touch it– Better not take the first step, which may lead to a habit of\n\naltering it– Better, rather, habituate ourselves to think of it, as unalterable– It\n\ncan scarcely be made better than it is– New provisions, wouldcreateintroduce new difficulties, and thus create, and increase appetite for still further\n\nchange– No sir, let is stand as it is– New hands have never touched it– The men who\n\nmade it, have done their work, andare^have passed^away– Who shall improve, on whattheydid? MrChairman, for the purpose of reviewing this message in the least possible time, as\n\nwell as for the sake of distinctness, I had analized it's arguments, as well as I could, and reduced them to the propositions I have stated–\n\nI have now examined them in detail– I wish to detain the committee only a little while\n\nlonger with some general remarks upon the subject of improvements– That the subject\n\nis a difficult one, can not be denied– Still it is no more difficult in congress,\n\nthan in the state legislatures, in the counties, or in the smallest municipal districts,\n\nwhich any where exist–All can recur to instances of this difficulty in the case of\n\ncounty-roads, bridges, and the like– One man is offended because a road passes over\n\nhis land, and another is offended because it doesnotpass over his; one is dissatisfied because the bridge, for which he is taxed, crosses\n\nthe river on a different road from that which leads from his house to town; another\n\ncan not bear that the county should be got in debt for these same roads and bridges;\n\nwhile not a few struggle hard to have roads located over their lands, and then stoutly refuse to let them be opened\n\nuntil they are first paid the damages– Even between the different wards, and streets,\n\nof towns and cities, we find this same wrangling, and difficulty– Now these are no\n\nother than the very difficulties, against which^and out of which,^the president constructs his objections of \"inequality\" \"speculation\" and \"crushing\n\nthe treasury\"– There is but a single alternative about them;objections; they aresufficient, or they arenot– If sufficient, they are sufficientoutof congress as well asinit, and there is the end– We must reject them, as insufficient, or lie down and do\n\nnothing, by any authority– Then, difficulty though there be, let us meet, and encounter\n\nit– Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt; Nothing so hard, but search will find it out–15 Determine that the thing can^and shall^be done, and then we shall find the way– The tendency to undue expansion is unquestionably\n\nthe chief difficulty– How to dosomething, and still not dotoomuch, is the desideratum– Let each contribute his mite in the way of suggestion– The lateSilas Wright, in a letter to the Chicago convention, contributed his, which was worth something;\n\nand I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing–16At all events, it will mislead nobody, and, therefore will do no harm– I would not\n\nborrow money– I am against an overwhelming, crushing system– Suppose, that at each\n\nsession, congress shall first determinehowmuchmoney can, for that year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to\n\nthe mostimportantobjects– So far all is easy; but how shall we determine whicharethe most important? On this question comes the collision of iterests–Ishall be slow to acknowledge, thatyourroad^harbor^, oryourriver is more important thanmine—andviceversa. To clear this difficulty, let us have that same statistical information, which the\n\ngentleman fromOhio(MrVinton) suggested at the beginning of this session– In that information, we shall^have^a stern, unbending basis offacts—a basis, in nowise subject to whim, caprice, or local interest– The pre-limited amount\n\nof means, will save us from doingtoomuch, and the statistics, will save us from doing, what we do, inwrongplaces– Adopt, and adhere to this course, and it seems to me, the difficulty is cleared– One of the gentlemen fromSouth Carolina(MrRhett) very much deprecates these statistics– He particularly objects, as I understand\n\nhim, to counting all the pigs and chickens in the land– I do not perceive much force\n\nin the objection– It is true that if every thing be enumerated, a portion of such\n\nstatistics may not be very useful to this object.17Such products of the country as are^to^beconsumedwhere they areproduced, need no roads or rivers—no means of transportation, and have no^very proper^connection with this subject– Thesurplus—that which is produced inoneplace, to be consumed inanother; the capacity of each locality for producing agreatersurplus; the natural means of transportation, and their susceptability of improvement; the hindrances, delays, and losses of life and property during transportation,\n\nand the causes of each, would be among the most valuable statistics in this connection–\n\nFrom these, it would readily appear where a given amount of expenditure would do the\n\nmost good– These statistics might be equally accessable, as they would be equally useful, to both the nation and the states– In this way,\n\nand by these means, let the nation take hold of the larger works, and the states the\n\nsmaller ones; and thus, working in a meeting direction, discretely, but steadily and\n\nfirmly, what is made unequal in one place may be equalized in another, extravagance\n\navoided, and the whole country put on that career of prosperity which shall correspond\n\nwith it's extent of teritory, it's natural resources, and the intelligence and enterprize of it's people–",

      "as I may, the general positions of this veto message– When I saygeneralpositions, I mean to exclude from consideration so much as relates to the present",
      "embarrassed state of the Treasury in consequence of theMexican war– Those general positions are: That internal improvements ought not to be made by the",
      "general govern- ment– 1– Because they would overwhelm the Treasury– 2– Because, while theirburthenswould be general, theirbenefitswould belocalandpartial; involving an obnoxious inequality—and 3– Because they would be unconstitutional– That the 4– Because the states may do enough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties—or",
      "if not 5– That the constitution may be amended– \"Do nothing at all, lest you do something wrong\" is the sum of these positions—is the sum of this message– And this, with the exception",
      "of what is said about constitutionality, applying as forcibly to making improvements",
      "by state authority, as by the national authority– So that we must abandon the improvements",
      "of the country^altogether,^by any, and every authority, or we must resist, and repudiate the doctrines of this",
      "message– Let us attempt the latter– The first position is, that a system of internal improvements would overwhelm the",
      "treasury– That, in such a system there is atendencyto undue expansion, is not to be denied– Such tendency is founded in the nature of",
      "the subject– A member ofcongresswill prefer voting for a bill which contains an appropriation for his district, to",
      "voting for one which does not; and when a bill shall be expanded till every district",
      "shall be provided for, that it will be too greatly expanded, is obvious– But is this",
      "any more true in congress, than in a state legislature? If a member of congress must",
      "have an appropriation for his district, so, a member of a legislature must have one",
      "for his county– And if one will overwhelm the national treasury, so the other will",
      "overwhelm the state treasury– Go where we will, the difficulty is the same– Allow",
      "it to drive us from the halls of congress, and it will, just as easily, drive us from",
      "the state legislaturesLet us, then, grapple with it, and test it's strength– Let us, judging of the future by the past, ascertain whether there may not be, in the discretion",
      "of congress, a sufficient power to limit, and restrain this expansive tendency, within",
      "reasonable, and proper bounds– The president himself values the evidence of the past–",
      "He tells us that at a certain point of our history, more than two hundred millions",
      "of dollars had been,appliedfor, to make improvements; and this he does to prove that the treasury would be overwhelmed",
      "by such a system. Why did he not tell us how much wasgranted? Would not that have been better evidence? Let us turn to it, and see what it proves–",
      "In the message, the president tells us that \"During the four succeeding years, embraced by the administration ofpresident Adams, the power not only to appropriate money, but to apply it, under the direction and",
      "authority of the General Government, as well to the construction of roads, as to the",
      "improvement of harbors and rivers, was fully asserted and exercised\"7 This, then, was the period of greatest enormity– These, if any, must have been the",
      "days of the two hundred millions– And how much do you suppose was really expended",
      "for improvements, during that four years? Two hundred millions? One hundred? Fifty?",
      "Ten? Five? No sir, less than two millions– As shown by authentic documents, the expenditures",
      "on improvements, during 1825 1826– 1827 and 1828, amounted to $1–879–627–01– These",
      "four years were the period of MrAdams' administration, nearly, and substantially– This fact shows, that when the",
      "power to make improvements \"was fully asserted and exercised\"8the congressesdidkeep within reasonable limits; and what has been done, it seems to me, can be done",
      "again– Now for the second position of the message, namely, that the burthens of improvements",
      "would begeneral, while theirbenefitswouldlocalandpartial, involving an obnoxious inequality– That there is some degree of truth in this position,",
      "I shall not deny– No com- mercial object of government patronage can be so exclusivelygeneral, as to not be of some peculiarlocaladvantage; but, on the other hand, nothing is solocal, as to not be of some general advantage– TheNavy, as I understand it, was established, and is maintained at a great annual expense,",
      "partly to be ready for war when war shall come, but partly also, and perhaps chiefly,",
      "for the protection of our commerce on the high seas– This latter object is, for all",
      "I can see, in principle, the same as internal improvements– The driving a pirate from",
      "the track of commerce on the broad ocean, and the removing a snag from it's more narrow",
      "path in theMississippi river, can not, I think, be distinguished in principle– Each is done to save life and",
      "property, and for nothing else– The Navy then, is the most general in it's benefits of all this class of objects;",
      "and yet even the Navy is of some peculiar advantage toCharleston, Baltimore,Philadelphia,New-YorkandBoston, beyond what it is to the interior towns ofIllinois– The next most general object I can think of would be improvements on the Mississippi",
      "river and it's tributaries– They touch thirteen of our states,Pennsylvania,Virginia,Kentucky,Tennessee,Mississippi,Louisiana,Arkansas,Missouri, Illinois,Indiana,Ohio,WisconsinandIowa– Now I suppose it will not be denied, that these thirteen states are a little more",
      "interested in improvements on that great river, than are the remaining seventeen–",
      "These instances of the Navy, and the Mississippi river, show clearly that there is",
      "something of local advantage in the most general objects– But the converse is also",
      "true– Nothing is solocalas to not be of somegeneralbenefit– Take, for instance, theIllinois and Michigan canal– Considered apartfromfrom it's effects, it is perfectly local– Every inch of it is within the state of",
      "Illinois– That canal was first opened for business last April– In a very few days",
      "we were all gratified to learn, among other things, that sugar had been carried fromNew-Orleansthrough this canal toBuffaloinNew-York– This sugar took this route, doubtless because it was cheaper than the old route–",
      "Supposing the benefit of the reduction in the cost of carriage to be shared between",
      "seller and buyer, the result is, that the New Orleans merchant sold his sugar a littledearer, and the people of Buffalo sweetened their coffee a littlecheaper, than before—a benefit resultingfromthe canal, not to Illinois where the canalis, but to Louisiana and New-York where it isnot– In other transactions Illinois will, of course, have her share, and perhaps the",
      "larger share too, in the benefits of the canal; but the instance of the sugar clearly",
      "shows that thebenefitsof an improvement, are by no means confined to the particular locality of the improvement",
      "itself– The just conclusion from all this is, that if the nation refuse to make improvements,",
      "of the more general kind, becausetheirtheir benefits may be somewhat local, a state may, for the same reason, refuse to",
      "make an improvement of a local kind, because, it's benefits may be somewhat general–The^A^statesmay well say to the nation \"If you will do nothing for me, I will do nothing for you–\" Thus it is seen, that if this argument of \"inequality\" is sufficient any where,isit is sufficient every where; and puts an end to improvementsalthaltogether– I hope and believe, that if both the nation and the states would, in",
      "good faith, in their respective spheres, do what they could in the way of improvements,",
      "what of inequality might be produced in one place, might be compensated in another,",
      "and that the sum of the whole might not be very unequal– But suppose, after all, there should be some degree of inequality– Inequality is certainly",
      "never to be embraced for it's own sake; but is every good thing to be discarded, which",
      "may be inseparably connected with some degree of it? If so, we must discard all government–",
      "This capitol is built at the public expense, for the public benefit but does any one doubt that it is of some peculiar local advantage to the property",
      "holders, and business peopeople ofWashington? Shall we remove it for this reason? and if so, where shall we set it down, and be",
      "free from the difficulty? To make sure of our object, shall we locate it nowhere?",
      "and have congress^hereafter^to hold it's sessions, as the loafer lodged \"in spots about\"? I make no special allusion to the present president when I say there are few stranger",
      "cases in this in this world, of \"burthen to the many, and benefit to the few\"9—of \"inequality\"—than the presidency itself is by some thought to be– An honest laborer",
      "digs coal at about seventy cents a day, while the president digs abstractions at about",
      "seventy dollars a day– Thecoalis clearly worth more than theabstractions, and yet what a monstrous inequity in the prices!– Does the president, for this reason,",
      "propose to abolish the presidency? Hedoesnot, and heoughtnot. The true rule, in determining to embrace, or reject any thing, is not whether",
      "it haveanyevil in it; but whether it have more of evil, than of good– There are few thingswhollyevil, orwhollygood– Almost every thing, especially of governmental policy, is an inseparable compound",
      "of the two; so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually",
      "demanded– On this principle the president, his friends, and the world generally, act",
      "on most subjects– Why not apply it, then, upon this question? Why, as to improvements,",
      "magnify theevil, and stoutly refuse to see anygoodin them? MrChairman, on the third position of the message, the constitutional question, I have",
      "not much to say– Being the man I am, and speaking when I do, I feel, that in any attempt",
      "at an original constitutional argument, I should not be, and ought not to be, listened",
      "to patiently– The ablest, and the best men, have gone over the whole ground long ago–",
      "I shall attempt but little more than a brief notice of what some of them have said– In relation to MrJeffersons views, I read from MrPolk's veto message– ⋄President Jefferson, in his message to Congress in 1806, recommended an amendment",
      "of the constitution, with a view to apply an anticipated surplus in the Treasury \"to",
      "the great purposes of the public education, roads, rivers, canals, and such other",
      "objects of public improvements as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional",
      "enumeration of the federal powers;\" and he adds: \"I suppose an amendment to the constitution,",
      "by consent of the States, necessary, because the objects now recommended are not among",
      "those enumerated in the constitution, and to which it permits the public moneys to",
      "be applied.\" In 1825, he repeated, in his published letters, the opinion that no such",
      "power has been conferred upon Congress.⋄10 I introduce this, not to controvert, just now, the constitutional opinion, but to",
      "show that onthat^the^onthe question ofexpediency, MrJeffersons opinion was against the present president—that this opinion of MrJefferson, in one branch at least, is, in the hands of MrPolk, like McFingal's gun: \"Bears wide, and kicks the owner over\"– \"Bears wide, and kicks the owner over\"–11 But to the constitutional question– In 1826,Chancellor Kentfirst published his commentaries on American Law– He devoted a portion of one of",
      "the lectures to the question of the authority of congress to appropriate public moneyes for internal improvements– He mentions that the question had never been brought under",
      "judicial consideration, and proceeds to give a brief summary of the discussions it",
      "had undergone between the legislative, and executive branches of the government–",
      "He shows that the legislative branch had usually beenfor, and the executive against the power, till the period of MrJ. Q. Adams' administration, at which point he considers the executive influence",
      "as withdrawn from opposition, and added to the support of the power– In 1844 the chancellor",
      "published a new edition of his commentaries, in which he adds some notes of what had",
      "transpired on the question since 1826– I have not time to read the original text,",
      "or the notes; but the whole may be found on page 267, and the two or three following",
      "pages of the first volume of the edition of 1844– As what chancellor Kent seems to",
      "consider the sum of the whole, I read from one of the notes: \"MrJustice Story, in his commentaries on the constitution of the United States, vol. 11 p 429-440,",
      "and again p 519– 538 has stated at large the arguments for and and against the proposition, that congress have a constitutional authority to lay taxes,",
      "and to apply the power to regulate commerce as a means directly to encourage and protect",
      "domestic manufacturers; and without giving any opinion of his own on the contested",
      "doctrine, he has left the reader to draw his own conclusions– I should think, however,",
      "from the arguments as stated, that every mind which has taken no part in the discussions,",
      "and felt no prejudice or teritorial bias on either side of the question, would deem the arguments in favor of the congressional",
      "power vastly superior–\"12It will seem, that in this extract the power to make improvements is not directly",
      "mentioned; but by examining the context, both of Kent and Story, it will be seen that",
      "the power mentioned in the extract, and the power to make improvements are regarded",
      "as identical. It is not to be denied that many great and good men have beenagainstthe power; but it is insisted that quite as many, as great and as good, have beenforit; and it is shown that, on a full survey of the whole, Chancellor Kent was of opinion",
      "that the arguments of the latter werevastlysuperior– This is but the opinion of a man, but who was that man? He was one of the",
      "ablest^and most learned^lawyers of his age, or of any age–^It is no disparagement to MrPolk, nor, indeed to any one who devotes much time to politics, to be placed far",
      "behind Chancellor Kent as a lawyer–^His attitude was most favorable to correct conclusions– He wrote coolly, and in retirement–",
      "He was struggling to rear a durable monument of fame; and he well knew thattruthand thoroughly sound reasoning were the onlysansure foundations– Can the party opinion of a party president, on a law question,",
      "as this purely is, be at all compared, or set in in opposition to that of such a man, in such an attitude, as Chancellor Kent? This constitutional question will probably never be better settled than it is, until",
      "it shall pass under judicial con- sideration; but I do think no man, who is clear on the questions of expediency, needs",
      "feel his conscience much pricked upon this– MrChairman, the president seems to think that enough may be done, in the way of improvements,",
      "by means of tonnage duties, under state authority, with the consent of the General",
      "Government– Now I suppose this matter of tonnage duties is well enough in it's own sphere– I suppose it may be efficient, and perhaps,sufficient, to make slight improvements and repairs, in harbors already in use, and not much",
      "out of repair– But if I have any correct general idea of it, it must be wholly inefficient",
      "for any generally beneficent purposes of improvement– I know very little, or rather",
      "nothing at all, of the practical matter of levying and collecting tonnage duties;",
      "but I suppose one of it's principles must be, to lay a duty for the improvement of any particular harbor,uponthe tonnagecomingintothatharbor– To do otherwise—to collect money inoneharbor, to be expended on improvements inanother, would be an extremelyagravated^aggravated^form of that inequality which the president so much deprecates– If I be right in",
      "this, how could we make any entirely new improvement^by means of tonnage duties^? How make a road, a canal, or clear a greatly obstructed river? The idea that we",
      "could, involves the same absurdity of the irish bull about the new boots—\"I shall never git em on\" says Patrick \"till I wear em a day or two, and strech em",
      "a little\"13We shall never make a canal by tonnage duties, until it shall already have been made",
      "awhile, so the tonnage can get into it– After all, the presidents concludes that possibly there may be some great objects of improvements which can",
      "not be effected by tonnage duties, and which, therefore, may be expedient for the",
      "General Government to take in hand– Accordingly he suggests, in case any such be discovered,",
      "the propriety of amending the constitution– Amend it for what? If, like MrJefferson, the president thought improvementsexpedient, but not constitutional, it would be natural enough for him to recommend such an amendment; but hear what he",
      "says in this very message: \"In view of these portentous consequences, I can not but think that this course of",
      "legislation should be arrested, even were there nothing to forbid it in the fundamental",
      "laws of our union\"–14 For what, then, wouldhehave the constitution amended? Withhimit is a proposition to removeoneimpediment, merely to be met byothers, which, in his opinion, can not be removed—to enable congress to do what, in his",
      "opinion they ought not to do, if they could!– (Here MrMeadeof Virginia, enquired if MrL. understood the president to be opposed on grounds of expediency to any and every",
      "improvement; to which MrL. answered) In the very part of his message of which I am speaking, I understand",
      "him as giving some vague expression in favor of some possible objects of improvements;",
      "but in doing so, I understand him to be directly on the teeth of his own arguments,",
      "in other parts of it– Neither the president, nor any one, can possibly specify an",
      "improvement, which shall not be clearly liable to one or another of the objections",
      "he has argued on the score of expediency– I have shown, and might show again, that",
      "no work—no object—can be so general, as to dispense it's benefits with precise equality; and this inequality, is chief among the \"portentous consequences\" for which hedeclares^declares^that improvements should be arrested– No sir, when the president intimates that something,",
      "in the way of improvements, may properly be done by the General Government, he is",
      "shrinking from the conclusions to which his own arguments would force him– He feels",
      "that the improvements of this broad and goodly land, are a mighty interest; and he",
      "is unwilling to confess to the people, or perhaps to himself, that he has built an",
      "argument which, when pressed to it's conclusions, entirely anihilates this interest– I have already said that no one, who is satisfied of the expediency of making improvements,",
      "needs be much uneasy in his conscience about it's constitutionality– I wish now to",
      "submit a few remarks on the general proposition of amending the constitution– As a",
      "general rule, I think, we would much better let it alone– No slight occasion should",
      "tempt us to touch it– Better not take the first step, which may lead to a habit of",
      "altering it– Better, rather, habituate ourselves to think of it, as unalterable– It",
      "can scarcely be made better than it is– New provisions, wouldcreateintroduce new difficulties, and thus create, and increase appetite for still further",
      "change– No sir, let is stand as it is– New hands have never touched it– The men who",
      "made it, have done their work, andare^have passed^away– Who shall improve, on whattheydid? MrChairman, for the purpose of reviewing this message in the least possible time, as",
      "well as for the sake of distinctness, I had analized it's arguments, as well as I could, and reduced them to the propositions I have stated–",
      "I have now examined them in detail– I wish to detain the committee only a little while",
      "longer with some general remarks upon the subject of improvements– That the subject",
      "is a difficult one, can not be denied– Still it is no more difficult in congress,",
      "than in the state legislatures, in the counties, or in the smallest municipal districts,",
      "which any where exist–All can recur to instances of this difficulty in the case of",
      "county-roads, bridges, and the like– One man is offended because a road passes over",
      "his land, and another is offended because it doesnotpass over his; one is dissatisfied because the bridge, for which he is taxed, crosses",
      "the river on a different road from that which leads from his house to town; another",
      "can not bear that the county should be got in debt for these same roads and bridges;",
      "while not a few struggle hard to have roads located over their lands, and then stoutly refuse to let them be opened",
      "until they are first paid the damages– Even between the different wards, and streets,",
      "of towns and cities, we find this same wrangling, and difficulty– Now these are no",
      "other than the very difficulties, against which^and out of which,^the president constructs his objections of \"inequality\" \"speculation\" and \"crushing",
      "the treasury\"– There is but a single alternative about them;objections; they aresufficient, or they arenot– If sufficient, they are sufficientoutof congress as well asinit, and there is the end– We must reject them, as insufficient, or lie down and do",
      "nothing, by any authority– Then, difficulty though there be, let us meet, and encounter",
      "it– Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt; Nothing so hard, but search will find it out–15 Determine that the thing can^and shall^be done, and then we shall find the way– The tendency to undue expansion is unquestionably",
      "the chief difficulty– How to dosomething, and still not dotoomuch, is the desideratum– Let each contribute his mite in the way of suggestion– The lateSilas Wright, in a letter to the Chicago convention, contributed his, which was worth something;",
      "and I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing–16At all events, it will mislead nobody, and, therefore will do no harm– I would not",
      "borrow money– I am against an overwhelming, crushing system– Suppose, that at each",
      "session, congress shall first determinehowmuchmoney can, for that year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to",
      "the mostimportantobjects– So far all is easy; but how shall we determine whicharethe most important? On this question comes the collision of iterests–Ishall be slow to acknowledge, thatyourroad^harbor^, oryourriver is more important thanmine—andviceversa. To clear this difficulty, let us have that same statistical information, which the",
      "gentleman fromOhio(MrVinton) suggested at the beginning of this session– In that information, we shall^have^a stern, unbending basis offacts—a basis, in nowise subject to whim, caprice, or local interest– The pre-limited amount",
      "of means, will save us from doingtoomuch, and the statistics, will save us from doing, what we do, inwrongplaces– Adopt, and adhere to this course, and it seems to me, the difficulty is cleared– One of the gentlemen fromSouth Carolina(MrRhett) very much deprecates these statistics– He particularly objects, as I understand",
      "him, to counting all the pigs and chickens in the land– I do not perceive much force",
      "in the objection– It is true that if every thing be enumerated, a portion of such",
      "statistics may not be very useful to this object.17Such products of the country as are^to^beconsumedwhere they areproduced, need no roads or rivers—no means of transportation, and have no^very proper^connection with this subject– Thesurplus—that which is produced inoneplace, to be consumed inanother; the capacity of each locality for producing agreatersurplus; the natural means of transportation, and their susceptability of improvement; the hindrances, delays, and losses of life and property during transportation,",
      "and the causes of each, would be among the most valuable statistics in this connection–",
      "From these, it would readily appear where a given amount of expenditure would do the",
      "most good– These statistics might be equally accessable, as they would be equally useful, to both the nation and the states– In this way,",
      "and by these means, let the nation take hold of the larger works, and the states the",
      "smaller ones; and thus, working in a meeting direction, discretely, but steadily and",
      "firmly, what is made unequal in one place may be equalized in another, extravagance",
      "avoided, and the whole country put on that career of prosperity which shall correspond",
      "with it's extent of teritory, it's natural resources, and the intelligence and enterprize of it's people–"
