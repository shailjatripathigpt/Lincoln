Douglas’ bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein theelection of 1858, Greeley’s preference for Douglas was evident in theNew York Tribune, of which he was editor. Lincoln asserted that the newspaper was widely read inIllinoisand described Greeley’s positive feelings for Douglas as conveyed in the publication\n                  as an ongoing “drag” on theRepublican Partyin Illinois.Erik S.

        "text": "4Douglas had criticized theLecompton Constitutionand President James Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in\n                  theDemocratic Party. Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution led some Republicans to consider\n                  supporting him in the U.S. Senate race in Illinois in 1858. Although Douglas later\n                  denied it, he courted Republican support—meeting in person with prominent eastern\n                  Republicans such as Greeley and hinting in correspondence that he was finished with\n                  the Democratic Party. Lincoln and other Republicans were concerned by these developments\n                  and urged fellow party members to remain loyal in the upcoming election. In Lincoln’s\n                  view, Douglas disagreed with the Buchanan administration over whether the Lecompton\n                  Constitution accurately represented the will of Kansans, but did not repudiate the\n                  overall goal of admittingKansasas a slave state.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-50."

        "text": "5Possibly a reference toJohn O. Johnson, who at or around this time was secretary to theIllinois Republican State Central Committee, of which Judd was currently chairman. During his tenure in Illinois in the 1850s,\n                  Johnson  acted as a correspondent for theNew York Tribuneas well as a private correspondent of Greeley’s.Delegates to the Illinois Republican Convention held on June 16, 1858, unanimously\n                  nominated Lincoln to challenge Douglas for a seat in the U.S. Senate.  At this time\n                  theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. With the counties of northern Illinois\n                  leaned strongly Republican and those of the southern part of the state leaned Democratic,\n                  the outcome of elections in central Illinois became pivotal.  Lincoln and Douglas\n                  both focused their efforts in the 1858 election campaign on central Illinois, a formerWhigstronghold, where the state legislative races were the closest.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:2; John O.
