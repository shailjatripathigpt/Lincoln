Greene, the “boy” referred to in this note, nor Gilbert A. Tracy, who originally published\n                  a transcription of this note in hisUncollected Letters of Abraham Lincoln, identified the first name of Mr. Wallace. The editors were also unable to identify\n                  Mr. Wallace’s first name. In hisLincoln the Comforter, Greene noted only that Mr. Wallace was “a business man” in Peoria.Gilbert A.

He then stayed overnight at\n                  the home of farmer  Jacob Strause, nearJacksonville, in exchange for agreeing to take Lincoln some legal papers as he passed through\n                  Springfield, thirty-five miles to the north of Strause’s farmhouse, the next day.\n                  When Greene arrived to deliver the papers, Lincoln was interested in why he had walked\n                  the entire distance, particularly since the weather was cold and snowy. After hearing\n                  Greene’s story, Lincoln discussed the institution of slavery with him for some time.\n                  He then gave Greene $5.00 for delivering the papers, scribbled anotein the margin of the edition of theLouisville Journalhe had been reading upon Greene’s arrival at his office, tore the note off, handed\n                  it to Greene, pointed to theGlobe Hotelacross the square from his office, and told him to stay there until he was able to\n                  continue on his journey.The next morning, as Greene prepared to leave the hotel, a messenger delivered  this\n                  handwritten note from Lincoln, asking Mr. Wallace to render what aid he could to Greene,\n                  should Greene require it, and accepting the responsibility for the cost of such aid.\n                  Greene did not meet Wallace, eventually made it home after walking a total of more\n                  than 800 miles on foot, and claimed he sold this “dingy” note around 1871 for $20.00.Gilbert J.
