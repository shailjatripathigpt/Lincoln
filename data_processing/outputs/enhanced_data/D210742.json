        "text": "2Stevens references Lincoln’s so-called “House Divided” speech, which Lincoln delivered\n                  at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionon June 16. In the speech, Lincoln addressedStephen A. Douglas’ recent conflict with PresidentJames Buchananover theLecompton Constitution. Some Republicans had been excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution\n                  to the extent that they considered supporting his bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Election. In his House Divided speech, Lincoln asserted that despite  Douglas’ actions with\n                  regard to the Lecompton Constitution, Douglas  and President Buchanan remained aligned\n                  on the issue of slavery and politically loyal to the slaveholding South.  Delegates\n                  to the Illinois Republican Convention unanimously nominated Lincoln to challenge Douglas\n                  for the U.S. Senate.

Douglas met with Greeley, who believed Douglas’ claims that he might join the Republican\n                  Party. Via editorials in theTribune, Greeley urged voters inIllinoisto support Douglas’ reelection to the U.S. Senate.
