        "text": "3Wentworth is discussing Republican Party strategy, and apparently advocating a delay\n                  in holding a statewideIllinoisRepublican convention to select candidates and draft a platform for the state andfederalelections of 1858.One of the offices up for election in 1858 was theU.S. Senateseat held by Stephen A. Douglas. Douglas criticized theLecompton Constitutionand President James Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in\n                  the Democratic Party. Some Republicans were excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the\n                  Lecompton Constitution to the extent that they considered supporting his bid for reelection\n                  to the U.S. Senate in 1858. Although Douglas later denied it, he courted Republican\n                  support—meeting in person with prominent men such asHorace Greeleyand hinting in correspondence to Republicans that he was finished with the Democratic\n                  Party. Lincoln and other Republicans were concerned by these developments and urged\n                  fellow party members to remain loyal in the upcoming election. In Lincoln’s view,\n                  Douglas disagreed with the Buchanan administration over whether the Lecompton Constitution\n                  accurately represented the will of Kansans, but did not repudiate the overall goal\n                  of admittingKansasas a slave state.Two days after the date of this letter, the Douglas and Buchanan factions of the Democratic\n                  Party in Illinois held separate conventions in Springfield. Lincoln and other Illinois\n                  Republican leaders observed the proceedings and held a conference that same evening.\n                  On the following day, theIllinois Republican State Central Committeeissued a call to the counties of Illinois to select delegates to attend the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionin Springfield on June 16, 1858, the purpose of which was to nominate candidates\n                  for state treasurer and superintendent of public instruction, as well as to effect\n                  “the more perfect organization of the Republican party in Illinois.” At the June 16,\n                  1858 convention Lincoln was nominated to challenge Douglas for the latter’s seat in\n                  the U.S. Senate.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-50, 458;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 21 April 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-04-21;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:2-6."

The letter causing the controversy was written by Washburne\n                  toCharles L. Wilsonon April 12, 1858. In it, Washburne wrote that in light of Douglas’ differences with\n                  the Democratic Party, he would consider welcoming him as an ally to the Republican\n                  Party, but that Lincoln must be the Republican Party’s candidate for the U.S. Senate\n                  in Illinois in 1858. LincolnwroteWashburne on April 26, 1858 regarding the  rumors, and the pair exchanged several\n                  letters in which Washburne sought to explain the misunderstanding and reassure Lincoln\n                  of his support.Howard W.
