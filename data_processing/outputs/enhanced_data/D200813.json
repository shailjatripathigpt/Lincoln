He returned to Springfield for the weekend, again leaving for Clinton on November\n                  13. Lincoln returned home to find Ichabod Codding’s letter on the evening of November\n                  17.Codding’s request came in the aftermath of the state andcongressional elections of 1854, which witnessed Lincoln’s return to politics after a brief hiatus concentrating\n                  on his law practice.  Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into the election\n                  campaign in the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 8 November 1854,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1854-11-08; 11 November 1854,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1854-11-11; 13 November 1854,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1854-11-13; 17 November 1854,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1854-11-17; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

At Springfield, Peoria, and other locations, Lincoln bemoaned the\n                  injustice of slavery and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but Lincoln did not go far enough\n                  to appease abolitionists. At Peoria he exclaimed, “But Nebraska is urged as a great\n                  Union-saving measure. Well I too, go for saving the Union. Much as I hate slavery,\n                  I would consent to the extension of it rather than see the Union dissolved, just as\n                  I would consent to any GREAT evil, to avoid a GREATER one.”Roy P.
