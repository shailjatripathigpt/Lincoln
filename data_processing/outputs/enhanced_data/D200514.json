        "text": "1This proviso was added to the end of thebillthat Abraham Lincoln introduced.  It was the result of a long battle in theHouse of Representativesover post roads and routes legislation arising out of the aftermath of theMexican War.    On February 29, 1848, The House Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads,\n                  of which Lincoln was a member, introduced abillto establish post routes.   The House re-submitted thebillto the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, and on May 16, the committee\n                  reported back thebill with amendments.   Included in thisamended billwas anamendmentadding postal routes inTexasto theRio Grande River--amendments that generated heated debate about the border of Texas.  These debates\n                  led to disagreements about the geographical extent of American acquisitions from the\n                  Mexican War, and theWilmot Proviso--disagreements  that threatened to scuttle the entire legislation.  On May 30, the\n                  House re-committed the bill to the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads. On\n                  June 14, the committee reported back thebill with further amendments.  The House further amended the bill, and ordered thebillengrossed.  SeveralWhigrepresentatives moved to re-consider the vote upon engrossment, arguing in part that\n                  thebill as engrossedcontained provisions extending the boundary of Texas toSanta Feand the Upper Rio Grande--territory in dispute claimed by what would become theNew Mexico Territory.  Endorsement of Texas’s claim to a boundary on the Rio Grande would have allowed\n                  slavery to move further west into acquisitions from Mexico, blunting the Wilmot Proviso.\n                  The House delayed action on re-consideration until June 21, whenWilliam L. Goggin, chairman of the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, proposed the proviso\n                  disavowing any opinion on the boundary issue as a means to save thebill.  This led to additional debate, and the House refused to re-consider the engrossment\n                  by a vote of 88 yeas to 87 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The House also refused\n                  to table the bill, with Lincoln voting nay.    Additional debate occurred on June\n                  26, but the House never read the bill a third time.U.S. HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 467, 803, 855, 894-95, 916, 931-34, 955;Cong.
