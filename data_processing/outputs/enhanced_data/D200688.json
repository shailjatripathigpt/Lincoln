        "text": "4Martin wrote Lincoln on July 17 regarding a missing telegram.  LincolnwroteMartin on July 19 that he had taken Martin’s letter to the Springfield telegraph\n                  office, but reported that the operator, after a thorough investigation, found no such\n                  telegram had been sent from the office.  Martin responded by writing the presumed\n                  text of the telegram, dated January 25, 1851,  on the verso  of Lincoln’s letter.\n                  Martin wrote Lincoln again on July 22, and Lincoln returned to the telegraph office.\n                  On July 26, LincolnwroteMartin that he had found the missing telegram, but could not determine who wrote\n                  it.Between February and August 1851, Lincoln wrote Martin an additional ten letters on\n                  legal matters, most relating Martin’s legal work in theMadison County Circuit Courtfor theAlton & Sangamon Railroad Company, which had retained Martin andLincoln & Herndonto collect balances due on shares of capital stock purchased by stockholders.  None\n                  of Martin’s letters to Lincoln from this period are extant.  It appears that this\n                  involves a separate legal issue, as none of the individuals included in the presumed\n                  telegram text written by Martin on the verso of Lincoln’s July 19letterwere principals in the railroad cases. The final disposition of the case is unknown.Alton & Sangamon RR v. Barret, Martha L.
