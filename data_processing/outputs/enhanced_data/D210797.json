Douglasin theU.S. Senate. Both Lincoln and Douglas delivered political speeches throughout Illinois during\n                  the campaign of 1858, battling on behalf of their respective parties for candidates\n                  up for election to theIllinois General Assembly. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the outcomes of the state’s local elections were a\n                  critical aspect of Lincoln and Douglas’ race for the U.S. Senate seat. They also eventually\n                  debated one another in the famousLincoln-Douglas Debates.  See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Lincoln did not deliver a campaign speech in Pontiac, Illinois, on August 21. He was\n                  instead in Ottawa, where and Douglas engaged in the first of the Lincoln-Douglas Debates.\n                  Lincoln delivered a short speech in El Paso in Livingston County on August 28, but\n                  only while waiting to catch a train to a scheduled speaking engagement elsewhere.\n                  Douglas spoke in Pontiac on September 2.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular\n                  through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained recognition\n                  as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Allen C.
