The case commenced\n                  in theU.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinoisin October, 1855 and concerned a dispute over ownership of lands near theOhio & Mississippi Railroad. The firms ofH. C. Seymour & CompanyandSanger, Camp & Companyhad joined together to purchase $6,000 worth of U.S. government land warrants for\n                  1,080 acres along the railroad for the purpose of land speculation.Irvin Camp, a partner in Sanger, Camp & Co., held the title to the warrants in order to locate\n                  the land and purchased the property in his own name.George W. CochranandJames C. Hallacquired H. C. Seymour & Co.’s interest in the lands and subsequently claimed that\n                  they had not received their due percentage of the land and sued to convey the 1,080\n                  acres. Camp retained Lincoln andWilliam H. Herndon, who were unable to effect a compromise but continued as attorneys in the case until\n                  Lincoln’selectionas president in 1860.In February of 1858 Camp had alsowrittenLincoln about this case, and enclosed aletterfromNewton D. Strong, another attorney for the defendants.Cochran & Hall v. Camp et al., Martha L.
