Members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time;\n                  therefore the outcome of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat. In the state’s local elections as\n                  a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas\n                  Democrats retained control of the General Assembly.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 November 1858, 2:1;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 November 1858, 2:4; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:546-47; Allen C.

        "text": "7The issue of slavery and its expansion to U.S. territories        served as a focal\n                  point of the Senate race. In December 1857, Douglas delivered a speech criticizing\n                  PresidentJames Buchanan’s support for theLecompton Constitution. While Douglas’s stance caused a rift in the Democratic Party, it also fueled rumors\n                  that Douglas might soon defect to the Republican Party. His commitment to popular\n                  sovereignty, whereby the people of a territory could vote on whether to legalize slavery,\n                  became a recurring issue during the Lincoln-Douglas Debates. On August 27, during\n                  the second debate at Freeport, Illinois, Lincoln posed four questions concerning the\n                  admission ofKansasto the Union and the expansion of slavery. In his second question, Lincoln asked\n                  Douglas whether the people of a territory could, in light of theDred Scott decision, “exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution?”\n                  Douglas responded by establishing what became called his “Freeport Doctrine.” Douglas\n                  answered yes, citizens could exclude slavery by local legislation. “Slavery cannot\n                  exist a day or an hour anywhere,” Douglas famously retorted, “unless it is supported\n                  by local police regulations, furnishing remedies and means of enforcing the right\n                  to hold slaves.” Douglas’s Freeport Doctrine proved distasteful to national Republican\n                  leaders who had previously pondered the benefits an alliance with him. It did, however,\n                  resolve the inconsistency between popular sovereignty and the Dred Scott decision,\n                  thereby satisfying his Illinois supporters.Douglas’s anti-Lecompton position also helped to charm some former Central IllinoisWhigswhose votes Lincoln and the Republicans sought to sway. Douglas argued that popular\n                  sovereignty aligned with the principles of the late renowned WhigHenry Clay. In October 1858,T. Lyle Dickeypublished a letter fromJohn J. Crittenden, another notable former Whig, that effectively amounted to an endorsement of Douglas.\n                  In aletterto Crittenden on November 4, Lincoln credited the use of Crittenden’s name as a contributing\n                  factor in his defeat.These factors coalesced to assure Douglas’s reelection to the Senate. His continued\n                  defense of popular sovereignty during the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, however, further\n                  alienated Southern pro-slavery Democrats. This ultimately dented his position in the\n                  national party and his chances in the American South in thepresidential election of 1860.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:553-57; Allen C.
