Abolitionists used these arguments, as did Lincoln and\n                  other antislavery members of the Republican Party as they fought the expansion of\n                  slavery.Cong.

PhillipswroteLincoln again on July 24.Both Phillips and Lincoln attended the 1858 Illinois Republican Convention in Springfield\n                  on June 16. Phillips served as a delegate for Union County, Illinois, and Lincoln\n                  served as a delegate forSangamon County.Both Nashville, Illinois and Richview, Illinois were part of the state’s Eighth Congressional\n                  District. Douglas DemocratPhillip B. Fouke, Buchanan DemocratThomas M. Hope, and RepublicanJehu Bakercompeted in the fall  of 1858 for the Eighth Congressional District’s seat in the\n                  U.S. House of Representatives. Voters elected Fouke with 57.2 percent of the total\n                  votes cast to Baker’s 41.8 percent and Hope’s 0.99 percent.In the Ninth Congressional District, Wiley ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives\n                  in 1858, but withdrew from the race in September. Phillips took his place that month,\n                  running as the Republican Party’s candidate for the state’s Ninth Congressional District.\n                  In the end, however, Douglas Democrat John A. Logan soundly won the Ninth Congressional\n                  District’s seat in the U.S. House, with nearly 16,000 votes to Phillips’ nearly 2,800.Dougherty was not elected Illinois state treasurer; voters elected RepublicanJames Millerto the position over both Dougherty andWilliam B. Fondey.Republicans won a majority of the votes cast in local elections in 1858, but pro-Douglas\n                  Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly. The final vote tally\n                  gave Democrats a majority of forty to thirty-five in theIllinois House of Representativesand a majority of fourteen to eleven in theIllinois Senate. Voters in southern Illinois awarded Douglas and pro-Douglas state candidates strong\n                  support, and, ultimately, Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate in the1858 Federal Election. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.Edward Callary,Place Names of Illinois(Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2009), 244, 295; Howard W.
