        "text": "8The Illinois General Assembly specified that the 1857 banking law went into force\n                  on the date of its passage; therefore, there was actually no gap between the date\n                  of its passage and the date it took effect.If Dubois penned a reply to this letter, it has not been located. Lincoln, however,\n                  wrote Dubois at least two more letters related to Dubois’ duties as state treasurer.\n                  Lincoln’s legal advice to Dubois also played a role in the casePeople ex rel. Billings v. Bissell. In the case, George W. Billings purchased two state bonds for $1,000 each in May\n                  1841.  By January 1, 1857, the state ofIllinoisowed Billings unpaid interest on the bonds. In February 1857, the Illinois General\n                  Assembly passed an act which “authorized and required” the governor of Illinois to\n                  address arrears of interest that were due and unpaid on the state’s public debt as\n                  of January 1, 1857, via the issuance of new state bonds. Billings requested that GovernorWilliam H. Bissellissue new bonds to allow him to collect $1,860 in unpaid interest on his 1841 bonds.\n                  Bissell refused, and Billings retained Lincoln,William H. Herndon,John T. Stuart, andBenjamin S. Edwardsand sued in theIllinois Supreme Courtfor a writ of mandamus compelling Bissell to issue the new state bonds.Stephen T. Loganrepresented Bissell. In December 1857, the court denied the writ of mandamus.In his opinion, JusticeJohn D. Catonacknowledged that the central issue in the case was whether or not the court had\n                  “jurisdiction to control the executive department of the government.”  Admitting that\n                  it was a “grave question” reaching “the very foundation principles upon which our\n                  government is based,” Caton stated that the three branches of government were essentially\n                  equal and that in order to work in harmony each branch “should, to a certain extent,\n                  control or restrain others.” However, Caton asserted, the Illinois Supreme Court had\n                  “no power to compel” the other branches of the state government “to perform any duty\n                  which the constitution or the law may impose upon them.” Each branch must be independent\n                  of the other, he argued, and therefore the court “does not possess the right to exercise\n                  coercive powers” over the governor of the state. The court had no power to compel\n                  Bissell to issue the bonds, and Billings’ only remedy was the impeachment and removal\n                  of Governor Bissell by the public.The bonds in question in this case were known as the “McAllister and Stebbins bonds.”\n                  In 1859, Lincoln sent and received at least four more pieces of correspondence related\n                  to these bonds.“An Act to Amend ‘An Act to Establish a General System of Banking,’ Passed February\n                     15th, 1851, and the Acts Amendatory Thereof,” 14 February 1857,      23-25;Abraham Lincoln to Jesse K.
