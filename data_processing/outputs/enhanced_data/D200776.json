As you have supposed, I am the grandson of your uncleAbraham; and the story of his death by the Indians, and ofUncle Mordecai, then fourteen years old, killing one of the Indians, is the legend more strongly\n\nthan3all others imprinted upon my mind and memory.4I am the son ofgrandfather’s youngest son,Thomas. I have often heard my father speak of hisuncle Isaacresiding at5Watauga(I think), near where the then States ofVirginia,North Carolina, andTennesseejoin,— you seem now to be some hundred miles or so west of that.6I often saw Uncle Mordecai, andUncle Josiahbut once in my life; but I never resided near either of them.7Uncle Mordecai died in 1831 or 2, inHancockCoun-<Page 2>ty, Illinois, where he had then recently removed fromKentucky, and where his children had also removed, and still reside,8as I understand.9Whether Uncle Josiah is dead or living, I cannot tell, not having heard from him\n\nfor more than twenty years. When I last heard of him10he was living onBig Blue River, inIndiana(Harrison Co., I think),11and where he had resided ever since before12the beginning of my recollection.13My father (Thomas) died the 17th of January, 1851, inColes County, Illinois, where he had resided twenty years. I am his only child.14I have resided here, and hereabouts, twenty-three years. I am forty-five years\n\nof age, and have awifeand three children, theoldesteleven years.15Mywifewas born and raised atLexington, Kentucky; and my connection with her has sometimes taken me there, where I have heard the\n\nolder16people of her relations17speak of your uncleThomasand his family18. He is dead long ago, and his descendants have gone to some part ofMissouri, as I recollect what I was told. When I was atWashingtonin 1848, I got up a correspondence withDavid Lincoln, residing at Sparta,Rockingham County, Virginia, who, like yourself, was a first cousin of myfather; but I forget, if he informed me, which of mygrandfather’s brothers was his father.19WithCol.

Your present governor,Andrew Johnson, was also at Washington while I was; and he told me of there being people of the\n\nname of Lincoln inCarter County, I think.21I can no longer claim to be a young man myself; but I infer that, as you are of\n\nthe same generation as myfather, you are some older. I shall be very glad to hear from you again.",

Significant differences\n                  from this version and theIllinois State Journalversionhave been noted; differences such as capitalization and minor grammar alterations\n                  have not been noted.The document does not contain a recipient name. Nicolay and Hay  listJesse Lincoln, and Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, does the same. Interestingly, the publication ofthis letterin an 1883 issue of theIllinois State Journal, reprinted from theChattanooga Times, includes a note suggesting the recipient could be named Israel: “Dr. Lincoln, of\n                  this city, a cousin of Abraham Lincoln, has in his possession a letter written to\n                  his father by his relative in 1854, which sheds some light on the illustrious statesmen’s\n                  family history. Dr. Lincoln’s father was at the time living in an upper East Tennessee\n                  county. The fame of Abraham Lincoln was becoming national at that period. Mr. Lincoln’s\n                  name was Israel, and all his relatives bore Biblical names. When the name Abraham\n                  Lincoln reached his ears he wrote him making inquiries regarding his family, feeling\n                  confident that he was a relative, and the following was the response.”  The Dr. Lincoln\n                  in question was Dr. James H. Lincoln, son of Jesse and Nancy Brown Lincoln.  Jesse\n                  Lincoln was the grand-uncle of Abraham Lincoln.  Nicolay, Hay, and Basler inferred\n                  Jessie Lincoln as the recipient from newspaper article, which incorrectly identified\n                  James H. Lincoln’s father as Israel.John G. Nicolay and John Hay, eds.,Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln, new and enlarged ed. (New York: Francis D. Tandy, 1905), 2:180-82; Roy P.
