        "text": "2Lamon is discussing counties in the Third Congressional District ofIllinois, whereOwen Lovejoywas up for reelection to theU.S. House of Representativesin theelection of 1858. Some of the more conservative Republicans of the district, Lamon among them, sought\n                  to replace Lovejoy, whom they labeled an abolitionist.In May of 1858 the Republican central committee of the district instructed their constituent\n                  counties to select delegates to attend a convention to be held inJolieton June 30, 1858, at which the district Republicans would nominate their congressional\n                  candidate.  The Republicans of McLean County held their county convention in Bloomington\n                  on June 5, and adopted a resolution approving of Lovejoy’s actions in the U.S. House\n                  of Representatives, after which a second resolution on Lovejoy, to “earnestly present\n                  his claims for a re-nomination, to the Joliet Convention” was adopted without dissent.\n                  The names of other candidates had been withdrawn prior to the passage of the resolution\n                  endorsing Lovejoy’s renomination.The Republicans of La Salle County held their county convention in Ottawa on June\n                  9. According to one newspaper report, prior to the convention it was expected that\n                  La Salle County Republicans would name two sets of delegates to the congressional\n                  convention in Joliet: one that backed Lovejoy, and one that supportedWilliam H. L. Wallace. On ascertaining that Lovejoy had a majority, Wallace’s supporters removed his name\n                  from consideration before the county convention took any actions. The Republicans\n                  at the La Salle County convention passed a resolution approving of Lovejoy’s actions\n                  in theU.S. Congress, followed by a resolution requesting their delegates to the congressional convention\n                  in Joliet to work to secure Lovejoy’s renomination.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A. Lacey, eds.,Illinois Elections, 1818-1990(Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1992), 10, 11,\n                     142; Edward Magdol,Owen Lovejoy: Abolitionist in Congress(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1967), 189-98;The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 20 May 1858, 2:1;The Weekly Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 9 June 1858, 2:1, 2;The Ottawa Weekly Republican(IL), 22 May 1858, 2:2, 3; 12 June 1858, 2:2, 4; Isabel Wallace,Life and Letters of General W.

        "text": "3At the McLean County Republican convention in Bloomington on June 5,Jesse W. Fellintroduced two resolutions. The first declared respect and admiration forStephen A. Douglasand otherDemocratswho opposed theLecompton Constitution, but stated that Democrats had no just claim to the political support of Republicans\n                  “so long as they refuse to place themselves upon Republican grounds”. The second resolution\n                  declared Abraham Lincoln to be the choice of the McLean County Republicans to replace\n                  Douglas in the U.S. Senate in the election of 1858,  elaborating that “despite all\n                  influences at home or abroad, domestic or foreign, the Republicans of Illinois,  as\n                  with the voice of one man, are unalterably so resolved: to the end, that we may have\n                  abig man, with abig mind, and abig heart, to represent ourbig State.” Both resolutions were adopted unanimously.Douglas had criticized the Lecompton Constitution andJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in theDemocratic Party. Some Republicans were excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution\n                  to the extent that they considered supporting his bid for reelection to the U.S. Senate\n                  in the election of 1858. Although Douglas later denied it, he courted Republican support\n                  and hinted in correspondence to Republicans that he was finished with the Democratic\n                  Party. Lincoln and other Illinois Republicans were concerned by these developments\n                  and urged fellow party members to remain loyal in the upcoming election.The Weekly Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 9 June 1858, 2:2; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-50."

Even if Lovejoy’s opponents could\n                  sway the conventions inWill, Kankakee, and DeWitt counties that would give them only eighteen delegates, well\n                  below a majority.The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 20 May 1858, 2:1; Edward Magdol,Owen Lovejoy: Abolitionist in Congress, 193."

Davis was put forward as an opposition candidate at the Republican convention\n                  in his home county of McLean, but was unable to convince enough delegates to support\n                  him over Lovejoy, whom the delegates then chose to back unanimously.

Illinois Republicans were suspicious of such involvement\n                  by eastern Republicans who supported Douglas in the 1858 U.S. Senate race and resented\n                  the outside interference. Rumor suggested that a group of eastern Republicans had\n                  made an agreement to support Douglas’ reelection in exchange for Douglas backingWilliam H.
