        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln made these remarks in the context of a debate over H.R. No. 290, introduced\n                  byRichard K. Meadeon March 2, 1848, “to change the times for holding the district courts of the United\n                  States in the western district of Virginia, and for other purposes.”  At issue was\n                  section three of the bill, which increased the salary of the judge from $1,600 to\n                  $2,500.  Prior to Lincoln’s remarks, members of theHouse of Representativesobjected to the salary increase and had voted to strike out the third section by\n                  a vote of 118 yeas to thirty-nine nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  Meade urged the\n                  House to reconsider, asking that the bill be committed to the Committee on the Judiciary\n                  with a recommendation that the salary be set at $2,000.  Meade defended the salary\n                  increase, citing the excessive labor and travel involved.  Lincoln spoke in response\n                  to Meade’s contentions.  The House ultimately tabled Meade’s request for reconsideration\n                  and passed the bill as amended.  TheSenatepassed the bill with an amendment setting the salary at $2,000, which the House did\n                  not approve, leading to a committee of conference, which recommended adoption of the\n                  Senate amendment.  The House tabled the committee of conference report without further\n                  action.H.R. 290, 30th Cong. (1848);Cong.
