        "text": "3Logan & Lincolnhandled at least one appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court on behalf of Irwin, a fellow\n                  lawyer from western Illinois. In April 1842, Irwin had represented Henry Cheseldine\n                  in a debt case inBrown County. The defendants,  Greenleaf C. Robinson and Thomas L. Adams, appealed the case to\n                  the Illinois Supreme Court. Logan & Lincoln represented Cheseldine in the appeal,\n                  which ran from December 1842 to December 1844. This may be the case about which Irwin\n                  was asking Lincoln.Robinson v. Cheseldine & Nye, Martha L.
