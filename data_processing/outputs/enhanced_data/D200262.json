MrHicksspoke in support of the motion, when the amendment was then agreed to. Mr.Charlesmoved to strike out the amendment relating to the time for holding court in the county\n\nofHancock. Mr Charles urged the necessity of this amendment, on the ground that one week was\n\nnot sufficient to get through the business on the docket. MrRossreplied that as Hancock had hitherto had but one week, it should have no more now:\n\nit would be impossible for the judges to get through the circuit if the time was to\n\nbe extended which the courts had hitherto had. MrCharlesreplied, when, MrHardinsuggested that the members from the different circuits should agree among themselves\n\nout of theHouse, on the time for holding courts; and proposed for this purpose that the amendment\n\nby stricken out. Messrs Ross andCharlesbriefly replied, when the amendment was stricken out as suggested by Mr Hardin.3 The question was then taken on the proposed amendment of the committee to allow only\n\n$1000 salary to the five new judges, which amendment was rejected, yeas 17, nays 68.4 MrTrumbullmoved the previous question, on thebill: not ordered.
