Lincoln also wrote the signatures of Green, Rutledge, Green, and Armstrong on\n                  page nine.Illinois’ 1818 constitution provided for state elections to be conductedviva voce, in which a voter would present himself in person to the election judges and declare\n                  his votes publicly. An election official would then record the votes in a poll book.\n                  In 1819, the First General Assembly reversed this provision in favor of voting by\n                  ballot. The legislature mandated a return toviva vocein 1821, ballots in 1823,viva voceagain in 1829, and finally settled on ballots in 1849.Ill. Const.
