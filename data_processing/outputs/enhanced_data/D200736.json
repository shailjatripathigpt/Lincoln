        "text": "3In American law, “ejectment” relates to an action to recover land or other real property\n                  and to collect damages. Originally, in the English common law, only tenants could\n                  use this action to recover possession of land from which they had been unlawfully\n                  ousted. Because of the simplicity and swiftness of the ejectment procedure, landowners\n                  began to use this action to recover land. To do so, the landowner, on behalf of a\n                  fictitious tenant (John Doe), sued a fictitious defendant (Richard Roe) for ousting\n                  the fictitious tenant. The court titled such cases John Doe ex dem. “Landowner” v.\n                  Richard Roe. When the defendant appeared in court, the clerk sometimes replaced “Richard\n                  Roe” with the defendant’s real name. In anactpassed in March 1839, the Illinois General Assembly abolished the need for the fictitious\n                  names. The losing party in an ejectment case was entitled by law to one new trial\n                  simply by paying the court costs.“Ejectment,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition, 2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),http://www.lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Reference.aspx?ref=Reference%20html%20files/Glossary.html."

        "text": "4Usher F. Linder’s reply, if he wrote one, has not been located.Lincoln is discussing the caseDavidson v. Bailey. In the case, in October 1851 Samuel Davidson suedDavid Baileyto eject him from property in Edgar County, Illinois that Davidson claimed to own.\n                  Bailey retained Lincoln and pleaded not guilty.  Lincoln then wrote this letter to\n                  Linder asking him to take the case since he could not travel to Edgar County, which\n                  was no longer a part of the Eighth Judicial Circuit which he  generally traveled.\n                  Although it is unclear if Linder took the case, Lincoln was in court trying another\n                  case inMetamorainWoodford County, Illinoison April 28, 1853—the day before theDavidson v. Baileycase went to trial in Edgar County. On April 30, 1853, Davidson gave up the suit,\n                  and the court ruled that he reimburse Bailey for the costs incurred for his defense.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 28 April 1853,http://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1853-04-28; Judge’s Docket, Document ID: 37918; Order, Document ID: 37922; Order, Document ID:\n                     37923,Davidson v.
