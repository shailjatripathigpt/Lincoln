        "text": "3Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General\n                  Assembly selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.Lincoln provided unspecified legal service to Ross, Martha L.
