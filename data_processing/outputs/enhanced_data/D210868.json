        "text": "2Haines is discussing the caseHaines & Haines v. Talcott et al.In the case, brothers Jonathan Haines andAnsel Hainessued Wait Talcott, along with the other surviving representatives ofManny and Company, for infringement upon a patent for a reaper (a kind of harvesting machine). The\n                  Haines brothers retained Abraham Lincoln, who launched the case in July 1858.Lincoln and the Haines brothers corresponded at least three more times regarding the\n                  case after this letter. Lincoln also corresponded with other individuals regarding\n                  this case at least five times.In 1859, Lincoln wrote to Peter H. Watson, the attorney for Talcott, requesting that\n                  they try the case in separate pieces. Watson refused. The trial was delayed because\n                  both sides needed to take depositions. No additional correspondence related to the\n                  case has been located beyond October 1859. Lincoln most likely represented the Haines’\n                  interests until he was elected president in the1860 Federal Election, but the final outcome of the case is unknown.Haines & Haines v.

Ruggin theU.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinoisin the fall of 1856 for also infringing upon his reaper patent. T. Lyle Dickey represented\n                  Rugg. The case went to trial before Judge Thomas Drummond in March 1858, and lasted\n                  just four days. The jury ruled for the plaintiff and awarded Haines $2,300 in damages.\n                  Rugg ultimately appealed this decision to theU.S. Supreme Court, in the caseRugg v. Haines. Lincoln represented Haines until he was elected president in the 1860 Federal Election.Rugg v. Hainescommenced December 9, 1862. On December 15, 1862, JusticeRoger B. Taneyupheld the lower court’s decision and awarded Haines $2,300 in damages as well as\n                  costs expended in the suit.Lincoln also wrote or received at least twelve other pieces of correspondence related\n                  toHaines v.
