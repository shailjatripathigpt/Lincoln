        "text": "2Lincoln was theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Election. He was running againstDemocraticincumbent Stephen A. Douglas. Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer\n                  and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to theracefor the Senate seat.Lincoln first made the “conspiracy charge” Lewis references during his so-called “House\n                  Divided” speech, which he delivered upon his acceptance of the Illinois Republican\n                  Party’snominationof him as their candidate for the U.S. Senate, but he also repeated the charge during\n                  theLincoln-Douglas Debates. He accused Douglas of being part of a plot or conspiracy to nationalize slavery--a\n                  conspiracy he blamed on Northern Democrats. He argued that the plot began with Douglas’s\n                  involvement in the passage of theKansas-Nebraska bill, then was advanced by both theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in theDred Scott caseand by PresidentJames Buchanan’s call to support the court’s decision. Lincoln warned his audiences that, if Douglas\n                  were not defeated and the pro-slavery conspiracy vanquished, another Supreme Court\n                  ruling could build upon the Dred Scott decision and proclaim that the U.S. Constitution\n                  prohibited states from excluding slavery within their own borders.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458-60, 492-540; Allen C.\n                     Guelzo, “Houses Divided: Lincoln, Douglas, and the Political Landscape of 1858,”The Journal of American History94 (September 2007), 392-94; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 206-9."

One charge he made while canvassing\n                  was that Douglas made a critical change to the Toombs bill—a bill thatRobert A. Toombsintroduced in the U.S. Senate in June 1856 that was aimed at quelling the escalatingpolitical violence in Kansasby providing a pathway for a state constitutional convention in theKansas Territory. The Senate had referred the measure to the Committee on Territories, which Douglas\n                  chaired at the time. When the committee reported on the bill, it no longer included\n                  a provision for the residents of Kansas to vote on any proposed constitution. Trumbull\n                  asserted that Douglas had made this change and was therefore hypocritical in his claims\n                  to support popular sovereignty. Trumbull made this charge his first speech of the\n                  campaign inChicagoon August 7, 1858.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln, 219-20; Ralph J.

He claimed Lincoln helped\n                  draft the resolutions and that they constituted proof that Lincoln was a radicalabolitionist. In reality, the resolutions he read aloud were from an 1854 Illinois Anti-Nebraska convention that was held inAurora, Illinois, in October 1854 and Lincoln was neither involved in their drafting nor did he attend\n                  the convention. The convention was organized by and composed of delegates who were\n                  much more radical in their politics with regard to slavery than anti-slavery moderates\n                  such as Lincoln.

In revenge, as he lay dying, Nessus convinced Dejanira to keep his bloody shirt,\n                  telling her that if her husband’s affections for her ever diminished Hercules need\n                  only don the shirt and his affections to Dejanira would be restored. When Hercules\n                  later turned his amorous attention toward Iole and Dejanira learned of this, she sent\n                  the shirt of Nessus for Hercules to wear. When Hercules donned the shirt, the poison\n                  burned his flesh to such an extent that he threw himself on a funeral pyre to escape\n                  the agony.Over time, “shirt of Nessus” became shorthand for any kind of inescapable misfortune.Edward Baldwin,The Pantheon: Or, Ancient History of the Gods of Greece and Rome(London: Thomas Hodgkins, 1806), 288-90; E.

During later debates, however, he confronted Douglas\n                  on the issue. Douglas eventually claimed that his mistake was an honest one, even\n                  though he  made the same misrepresentation in an 1856 speech in the U.S. Senate (which\n                  Trumbull took him to task for at the time).

The votes of former members of theWhig Partyin central and southern Illinois were critical to the election, and Douglas hoped\n                  to link Clay to the doctrine of popular sovereignty as a way to convince former Whigs\n                  that he and Clay shared a common interest in keeping slavery out of national politics.Lincoln greatly admired Clay, whom he referred to during the debates as “my beau ideal\n                  of a statesman, the man for whom I fought all my humble life.” He quoted Clay’s thoughts\n                  on slavery during the debates, emphasizing his agreement with Clay’s view of it as\n                  “a great evil” and an unfortunate inheritance from the nation’s forefathers that its\n                  citizens must contend with as best they could. He also accused Douglas of representing\n                  that class of men whom Clay referred to as determined to “repress all tendencies to\n                  liberty and ultimate emancipation” by snuffing out “the moral lights around us.”Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.

Lovejoy was running for reelection to theU.S. House of Representativesin the election of 1858 and was a controversial figure within the Republican Party\n                  on account of his fervent abolitionism. Many Republicans believed the controversy\n                  surrounding Lovejoy’s views was detrimental to the party as a whole and to Lincoln’s\n                  chances in the senatorial race, particularly since Democrats such as Douglas were\n                  keen to brand all Republicans as radical abolitionists. Recognizing Lovejoy’s great\n                  popularity among the people in his district, Lincoln supported Lovejoy’s reelection\n                  bid and even personally warned Lovejoy of potential plots to entice a Republican to\n                  run against him. Although his political support for Lovejoy brought some recrimination\n                  upon Lincoln, it likely prevented voters in Lovejoy’s district from turning against\n                  Lincoln and his fellow Republicans. Nevertheless, Lincoln did not go out of his way\n                  to be publicly associated with Lovejoy, which may explain why he did not use his influence\n                  to bring Lovejoy along when he spoke in Jacksonville.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 27 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-27;The Illinois State Journal, 29 September 1858, 2:7;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 July 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:456;Abraham Lincoln to Owen Lovejoy."

Your conspiracy charge,\n               (keep it going, for it is true as God's own word,)2Trumbull's charge in regard to popular sovereignty and theToombsbill,3and now the fact, (if true,) that he has passed a forgery upon theOttawa meetingin regard to the Springfield Convention of 1854.4These things well worked up and thoroughly brought before the people will give us\n               10000 votes which otherwise are sure for Douglas.  I beg that for the sake of the\n               cause you will<Page 2>put all the fire and spirit and vehement energy into these charges you can andbrandthem upon Douglas till like the shirt of Nessus5they himasapolitician, dead.  Now in regard to that resolution if he was guilty of the infamous falsehood\n               charged, it is your duty to expose him thoroughly.  He has shown you no mercy and\n               treated you with no honor or decency.  All delicacy and tenderness towards him who\n               has called you aliarand has basely slandered all yourparty, is unjust to your friends and to yourself.  Hold him to a severe reckoning.6If he has lied about the Springfield Convention, get the affidavits of a dozen or\n               twenty of the best men who attended that convention<Page 3>and prove the true facts.  We are getting to day the Affidavits of all who attended the Convention from thisCounty.  Mercy to Douglas is treachery to the cause of Right and Humanity.  Cant you and ourCentral Committeeget some competent man to prepare a document on Douglas which shall unmask and expose\n               to the people all his political villainies for the last four or more years? Such a\n               thing moderate in language, but awful in its facts, commencing with his intense love\n               for theMissouri Compromiseand showing him up as the murderer of the same,7noting his old malice and hate ofHenry Clayand exposing his late attempts to wheedle his followers now he is dead, and even\n               to dig up his bones as it were to manure<Page 4>his own political cornfield,8with all his other treacheries dodges and falsities, if made into a  telling document\n               and scattered broadcast will tell fearfully against him.9Can you tell us yet when you will come here?  People ask every day.  Cant you let us know the time very soon.  We intend if possible to haveLovejoywith us on the same occasion or some other and take him toBeardstownandWinchester.  Please let us know about this as soon as you conveniently can.  If you see Lovejoy\n               use your influence with him to bring him along.10You are gaining here much, especially within the last 10 or 15 days all over our\n               County.Dugis losing ground here.At least100 openDemocratsarecertainto vote against him inMorgan, and the number of the openly rebellious is still increasing.  I write this after\n               consulting with MrYates^& other friends^and by request.  You may remember meeting me at the lastcourtat Beardstown court.11"
