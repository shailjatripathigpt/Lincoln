        "text": "5In his June 22letterto Lincoln, Somers requested clarification on “how it is that Congress has the power\n                  to inhib[it] the introduction of slaves in a Territory but no power to establish or\n                  Legislate it therein.” In his reply to Somers’ question, Lincoln references the implications\n                  of the caseScott v. Sandford. In addition to ruling that both free and enslaved black persons were not U.S. citizens,\n                  theU.S. Supreme Courtruled that Congress did not have the authority to prohibit the introduction of slavery\n                  into the western territories. For full details on the case, seeScott v. Sandford.Lincoln criticized the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision inScott v. Sandfordin his June 16, 1858 “House Divided” speech at the1858 Illinois Republican Convention, and the court’s decision in the case featured heavily in the 1858 Federal Election—including\n                  in theLincoln-Douglas Debates.The Republicans of Illinois’ Thirty-Sixth House District ultimately nominatedDaniel Stickelrather than Peter K. Hull for a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives, as\n                  Hull had not lived in the district long enough to be eligible for office per article\n                  three, section three of the1848 Illinois Constitution. Voters elected Stickel to the Illinois House in the election of 1858.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:439; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois;Henry C.
