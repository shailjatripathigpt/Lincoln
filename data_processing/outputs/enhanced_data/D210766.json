Lincoln was\n                  the Republican Party candidate forU.S. Senatein 1858. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.The moralizing tone of the Republican platform to stop the spread of slavery led many\n                  German-Americans to push for the party to defend immigrants. However, the Republican\n                  Party needed both the German votes and the votes of formerAmerican Partymembers to win in1858. These two groups possessed decidedly opposing viewpoints, with the nativism of the\n                  American Party directing its anger at immigrants such as the Germans. Lincoln was\n                  not a supporter of nativism and in alettertoJoshua F. Speedin 1855 he wrote, \"How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor\n                  of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to\n                  be pretty refined.\"Hecker addressed a crowd of German Republicans inBloomingtonin late October, and he was described by one newspaper as \"the political idol of\n                  the German population of thisstate.\" Hecker also spoke inChicagoon October 23 and inGalenaon October 28.Alison Clark Efford, \"Abraham Lincoln, German-Born Republicans, and\n                     American Citizenship,\"Marquette Law Review93 (Summer 2010): 1376-78; Sabine Freitag,Friedrich Hecker: Two Lives for Liberty, trans. by Steven Rowan (St. Louis: St. Louis Mercantile Library, University of Missouri–St.\n                     Louis, 2006), 199; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:432, 458;The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 30 October 1858, 3:1;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 26 October 1858, 1:4; 30 October 1858, 1:3."

At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.The southern counties in Illinois leaned heavily Democratic and had more legislative\n                  seats than deserved based on the past census. In the1858 congressional election, Democrats defeated the Republicans in Morgan County 53.2 to 46.4 percent, Macoupin\n                  County 55.4 to 42.7 percent, Peoria County 47.6 to 47.2 percent,  Randolph County\n                  54 to 45.4 percent, and McDonough County 52.1 to 47.6 percent. Republicans won in\n                  St. Clair County 53.6 to 44.8 percent. In elections for the Illinois House, Democrats\n                  won in Morgan, Macoupin, Randolph, and McDonough counties and Republicans won in Peoria\n                  and St. Clair counties.
