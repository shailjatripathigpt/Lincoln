Significant differences in content and word choice are noted.Lincoln quoted from a speech delivered byHenry Claybefore theAmerican Colonization Societyin the hall of theU.S. House of Representativeson January 20, 1827.  Variant reports of Clay’s speech appeared in Washington, DC\n                  newspapers, and Clay subsequently published it as a pamphlet.
