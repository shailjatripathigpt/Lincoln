It is proper in the commencement of our undertaking, to announce the principles by\n\nwhich we shall be governed in conducting thispaper. In the first place, we are thoroughly convinced of the goodness of the cause we\n\nadvocate, and we shall not descend from the vantage ground of truth, and principle\n\neither to imitate or injure an adversary. As good men lose character by keeping company\n\nwith bad ones, so a just cause and true reasons, may lose their power by being joined\n\nwith error and mingled with falsehood. We propose therefore, while we shall fearlessly expose corruption, and resist the\n\nusurpations of power, to employ only the weapons of truth and reason, and we rejoice\n\nwhile these are at our command, that the history of the country has shown, how potent\n\nthey may become where the great body of the people are at once the judges of the conflict,\n\nand partakers in the strife. With this confidence and these arms, we enter the contest. We intend to advocate the election ofGen. W. H. HARRISONto the Presidency,2and the reasons of this choice will be presented in the columns of this paper; and\n\nthese reasons are to be found in the character of the man, established during a long\n\nlife of public service, in the goodness of his principles, formed in the school ofWashington, and in the history of the country, illustrated and brightened by his wisdom and\n\nhis valor. We rely upon him to restore the country to its former prosperity, because\n\nhe is, to useMr. Jefferson’s standard, “honest and capable.” We rely upon him to administer the government\n\nfaithfully, because his life, has been a living commentary upon his devotion to the\n\nconstitution. We rely upon him to maintain the glory of the Republic, because at\n\nhome and abroad, in the public councils and on the battle-field, he has made that\n\nglory ours. We have ever trusted in the calm deliberate judgment of the People. And now when\n\nthe eyes of the wise and good are cast with painful anxiety upon the “signs of the\n\ntimes,” we desire to lay before them such facts as may enable them to form that judgment\n\nwisely and well. And while we are thus struggling for the success of principles upon\n\nwhich, not only the welfare, but the duration of the Union depend, our appeals to\n\nthe “sober second thought” of our fellow citizens will at least not be weakened by\n\nour deep conviction of the purity of the cause we advocate, and the fearfulness of\n\nthe danger we would avoid.",
