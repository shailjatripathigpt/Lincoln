        "text": "2This payment by Jacob Ruckel settled the mortgage on a loan that Lincoln originallymadeto Daniel E. Ruckel in August 1851 for several lots of land Daniel had wished to\n                  purchase inSpringfield, Illinois. On July 7, 1853, Lincoln released lots nine, ten, eleven, and twelve of “Allen’s\n                  addition to Springfield” from the mortgage Daniel had owed him. Daniel made one payment\n                  to Lincoln in January 1854, but died on April 9, 1854, before he could repay the remainder\n                  of this debt. His brother, Jacob Ruckel, and Richard H. Beach became the administrators\n                  of his estate, and made some additional payments on the mortgage between 1854 and\n                  1857.On the same date as this receipt, Jacob Ruckel andLaura Ruckel, his wife,mortgagedto Lincoln, for $500, four lots of land that Jacob had acquired from his brother’s\n                  estate. They agreed to repay this mortgage, plus ten percent interest for the year,\n                  within one year. The mortgage was extended, but eventually paid in full in January\n                  1864.Promissory Note of Daniel E.
