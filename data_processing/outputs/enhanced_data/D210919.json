Bryant was running as the Republican candidate for the Forty-SeventhIllinois House of RepresentativesDistrict. At the time of this letter, Lincoln was the Illinois Republican Party’s\n                  candidate to replaceDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senate. He and Douglas both canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858,\n                  delivering speeches in support of candidates for the Illinois General Assembly in\n                  their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the\n                  state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for the Illinois\n                  House  andIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the U.S. Senate race.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 November 1858, 2:2; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

In Illinois’s local elections,\n                  Bureau County’s voters elected Bryant to the Illinois House, and RepublicanBurton C. Cookheld over from 1856 in the Illinois Senate. Both men cast their ballots for Lincoln\n                  in the1858 Federal Election. In the local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast\n                  in the state, but because  pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly, Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate.  Through the\n                  campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas\n                  Debates, Lincoln gained recognition and respect within the national Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, October 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=10; John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 219-20, 222;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 November 1858, 2:4; Illinois SenateJournal. 1859. 21st G.
