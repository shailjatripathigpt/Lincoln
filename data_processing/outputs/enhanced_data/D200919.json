        "text": "4Hecker  supported theRepublican Partyand had high standing amongst German immigrants, of which there were a good number\n                  in the United States: between 1850 and 1854, more than 650,000 Germans arrived in\n                  the U.S. In 1854 alone, there were 215,009 immigrants to the U.S. from Germany.Opponents of theKansas-Nebraska ActinIllinoishoped to enlist German Americans in the coalition they were building to challengeDemocratsin the1856 Federal Election. At theIllinois Anti-Nebraska Convention, delegates nominatedFrancis A. Hoffman, a prominent German American politician, as their candidate for lieutenant governor\n                  to that end. They also selected Hecker as a presidential elector. Hecker’s selection\n                  obligated him to make political speeches to German American audiences on behalf ofJohn C. Fremont, the Republican candidate for president, and other Republican candidates for office.\n                  Hecker made his first speech atMascoutah, Illinois, on June 28, 1856.On August 12, Hecker’s house nearBellevilleburned to the ground. Hecker and others suspected arson in retribution for his political\n                  activism on behalf of the Republican Party. On September 8, LincolnwrotetoCharles H. Rayregarding Hecker’s house fire, noting, “It would be no more than just for us to raise\n                  him a thousand dollars in this emergency... We can not spare his services.” Lincoln donated $100 to the cause.William T.
