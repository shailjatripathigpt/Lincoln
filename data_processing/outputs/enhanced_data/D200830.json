The Nineteenth Illinois General Assembly, which commenced on January 1, 1855,\n                  received several resolutions concerning the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, but Lincoln's resolutions\n                  were not introduced.Pages one and two of this document are likely the first draft of Lincoln’s resolutions;\n                  pages four and five are likely the second draft.Roy P.

        "text": "2Article one, section nine of the United States Constitution forbid the prohibition\n                  of the international slave trade prior to 1808: “The Migration or Importation of such\n                  Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be\n                  prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight,\n                  but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for\n                  each Person.” The Ninth Congress,  at the second session in 1807, reviewed and passed\n                  “An Act to Prohibit the Importation of Slaves into any Port or Place Within the Jurisdiction\n                  of the United States, From and After the First Day of January, in the Year of Our\n                  Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Eight.” The ban on the importation of enslaved\n                  persons into the U.S. thus took effect on January 1, 1808.Section fourteen of theKansas-Nebraska Actdescribes the concept of popular sovereignty for Nebraska: “That the Constitution,\n                  and all Laws of the United States which are not locally inapplicable, shall have the\n                  same force and effect within the said Territory of Nebraska as elsewhere within the\n                  United States, except the eighth section of the act preparatory to the admission of\n                  Missouri into the Union, approved March sixth, eighteen hundred and twenty, which,\n                  being inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery\n                  in the States and Territories, as recognized by the legislation of eighteen hundred\n                  and fifty, commonly called theCompromise Measures, is hereby declared inoperative and void; it being the true intent and meaning of\n                  this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom,\n                  but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic\n                  institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States:\n                  Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to revive or put in force\n                  any law or regulation which may have existed prior to the act of sixth March, eighteen\n                  hundred and twenty, either protecting, establishing, prohibiting, or abolishing slavery.”\n                  Section thirty-two repeats the text of section fourteen verbatim, only replacing “Territory\n                  of Nebraska” with “Territory of Kansas.” Lincoln argued that the text of the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act, promising to allow each state to “form and regulate their domestic institutions\n                  in their own way,” directly opposed the 1808 Importation Act and should be removed.U.S. Const., art.
