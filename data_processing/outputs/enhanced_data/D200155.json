Mr.Englishmoved to lay the resolution on the table till the 4th of July next. Mr. Jarrott disclaimed any unfriendly feelings towards the gentleman fromAdams(Mr. Flood) and he was entirely welcome to all the solicitude that he supposed him\n\nto feel for his reputation. Mr.Ficklinwas glad the motion had been made to lay on the table, as it bro’t up the merits of the resolution. He gave it as his opinion, that no one could be\n\nsaid to hold an office, in any such sense as to exclude him from another office, till\n\nhe had taken the oath, given bond, &c. Mr.Pacesuggested that thegentlemanwho introduced the resolution, should withdraw it. Mr.Williamshoped that he would not withdraw it. Had it not been offered, he should have offered\n\na similar one,though divested of its personality; for, in wishing that the inquiry should be instituted, he was actuated by no unfriendly\n\nfeeling toward his colleague, but a solemn conviction of duty alone. The appointment\n\nof his colleague has been announced in the public papers; and being looked upon as\n\nthe incumbent of that office, he asked whether there was not room to apprehend the\n\nprevalence of that kind of influence here, which it was the object of the constitution\n\nto guard against ? In supporting the resolution, he felt that he was exerting a supervisory\n\ncare, not so much over theRegister elect, as over the constitution, and the purity of our legislation. He thought the object of the resolution, was a proper subject of inquiry; it is a\n\nfair presumption, that the pay of this officer commences with the date of his appointment;\n\nwhich was the 8th of January.—If so, then he is excluded by the Constitution from\n\na seat in thisHouse; the circumstance of his not having been sworn in, is quite unimportant. He did\n\nnot mean to impugn the character of his colleague; for, he knew him to be an honorable\n\nman; but, he hoped that the inquiry would be made; and that the committee on the Judiciary\n\nwould report, whether he was to be properly considered as now holding said office,\n\nby virtue of an appointment to it, on his application; even though he had not been\n\nformally installed. Mr. Flood hoped that the House would decide upon the merits of the resolution, without\n\nreferring it to any committee. Mr.Lincolnwould not like to see the abstract question of right to a seat in this legislature\n\nblinded with any personal interests. He should therefore vote against laying the resolution\n\non the table till the 4th of July; and if this motion were lost, he would move to\n\nlay it on the table—with the intention of letting it lie there till near the close\n\nof the session; when it could be taken up without wearing the appearance of being\n\na personal attack. Mr. Williams regretted that the inquiry had not come up in an abstract form; but it\n\nis of great importance that we know how the constitution is to be understood; and\n\nthat thepeopleknow what their representatives are doing. Possibly the people are suffering inconvenience\n\nin the absence of the register from his office. Mr. Flood said, thathecould do nothing there, until a Receiver was appointed, and that the office was not\n\nshut onhisaccount alone. The discussion was continued by Messrs.English,WalkerofVermillion,Henderson,HenryandMarshall. At the request of Mr. Flood, Mr. English withdrew his motion to lay on the table till\n\nthe 4th of July. Mr.Thorntonoffered an amendment (striking out all of a personal character, and limiting the\n\ninquiry to the abstract matter,) which Mr. Jarrott adopted as a modification of his\n\nresolution.
