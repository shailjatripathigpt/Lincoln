Young, had appointed Lucas as a temporary clerk in the Land Office in March 1849, but Lucas\n                  was worried about his tenure with rumors swirling that Young was to be replaced. \n                  Lucas held onto his job through the spring, and he sent Lincoln a steady stream of\n                  letters informing Lincoln on the contest for commissioner and on appointments to land\n                  offices throughout Illinois.  Lucas’ name does not appear in the official register\n                  of the officers and agents of the government employed as of September 30, 1849, so\n                  he must have lost his position.
