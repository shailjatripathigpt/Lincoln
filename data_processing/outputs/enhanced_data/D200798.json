It repeals theMissouri Compromise; and then puts in a declaration that it is not intended by this repeal to legislate\n\nslavery in or exclude it therefrom, the territory. Sec. 14. That the constitution, and all the laws of the United States which are not locally\n\ninapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within said territory ofNebraskaas elsewhere in the United States, except the 8th section ofthe actpreparatory to the admission ofMissouriinto the Union, approved March sixth, eighteen hundred and twenty, which being inconsistent\n\nwith the principles of non-intervention bycongresswith slavery in the States and Territories as recognized by thelegislationof eighteen hundred and fifty, commonly called the compromise measures, is hereby\n\ndeclared inoperative and void; it being the true intent and meaning of thisactnot to legislate slavery into any territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom,\n\nbut to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic\n\ninstitutions in their own way, subject only to the constitution of the United States:\n\nProvided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to revive or put in force\n\nany law or regulation which may have existed prior to theactof sixth of March, eighteen hundred and twenty, either protecting, establishing,\n\nprohibiting, or abolishing slavery.”2 The state of the case in a few words, is this: The Missouri Compromise excluded slavery\n\nfrom theKansas-Nebraska territory. The repeal opened the territories to slavery. If there is any\n\nmeaning to the declaration in the 14th section, that it does not mean to legislate\n\nslavery into the territories, is this: that it does not require slaves to be sent\n\nthere. The Kansas and Nebraska territories are now as open to slavery asMississippiorArkansaswere when they were territories. To illustrate the case—Abraham Lincolnhas a fine meadow, containing beautiful springs of water, and well fenced, whichJohn Calhounhad agreed with Abraham (originally owning the land in common) should be his, and\n\nthe agreement had been consummated in the most solemn manner, regarded by both as\n\nsacredJohn Calhoun, however, in the course of time, had become owner of an extensive herd\n\nof cattle— the prairie grass had become dried up and there was no convenient water\n\nto be had. John Calhoun then looks with a longing eye on Lincoln’s meadow, and goes\n\nto it and throws down the fences, and exposes it to the ravages of his starving and\n\nfamishing cattle. “You rascal,” says Lincoln, “what have you done? what do you do\n\nthis for?”— “Oh,” replies Calhoun, “everything is right. I have taken down your fence;\n\nbut nothing more. It is my true intent and meaning not to drive my cattle into your\n\nmeadow, nor to exclude them therefrom, but to leave them perfectly free to form their\n\nown notions of the feed, and to direct their movements in their own way!” Now would not the man who committed this outrage be deemed both a knave and a fool,—\n\na knave in removing the restrictive fence, which he had solemnly pledged himself to\n\nsustain;— and a fool in supposing that there could be one man found in the country\n\nto believe that he had not pulled down the fence for the purpose of opening the meadow\n\nfor his cattle?3",
