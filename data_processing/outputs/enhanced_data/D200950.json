        "text": "3Abraham Lincoln wrote this endorsement and signed his own name.This letter is related to the casePeople v. Hibbs. In June 1855, the State of Illinois indicted John Hibbs for manslaughter. Hibbs\n                  retained Lincoln andWilliam Herndonfor his defense and pled not guilty;Amzi McWilliamsrepresented the people. On June 13, the Logan County Circuit Court granted a change\n                  of venue and transferred to case to theSangamon County Circuit Court. The case came before the court in March 1856, and, on March 19, the jury found Hibbs\n                  guilty and recommended a sentence of two years. Lincoln and Herndon motioned for a\n                  new trial, but, on March 29, the court sentenced him to the recommended two years\n                  in the Illinois State Penitentiary. As this letter to Governor William H. Bissell\n                  and apetitiondemonstrate, in 1857 Lincoln and others petitioned Bissell to grant Hibbs a pardon.\n                  On May 16, 1857, Governor Bissell ordered Hibbs pardoned.Although the precise date that Lincoln wrote this endorsement and that he and John\n                  T. Stuart each signed it is unclear, it must have been sometime after Davis wrote\n                  the above letter on May 8 and May 16—when Governor Bissell pardoned Hibbs.People v. Hibbs, Martha L.
