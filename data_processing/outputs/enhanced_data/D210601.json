The presence of an anti-Nebraska majority gave opponents of Stephen A. Douglas and\n                  the Democrats leverage in the imminent election for U.S. Senator. IncumbentJames Shields, a supporter of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, was up for reelection, and the anti-Nebraska\n                  forces relished the opportunity to replace him with one of their own.

        "text": "5Powers is referring to old-lineDemocrats, longtime members of the party adhering to its traditional agenda prior to the rise\n                  of factions over the spread of slavery into western territory.  Old Line Democrats\n                  and Whigs were those politicians committed to thecompromise measures of 1850, which the Kansas-Nebraska Act supposedly brought into law.The Kansas-Nebraska Act and its implications for the extension of slavery reignited\n                  Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and his opposition to the act made him a favorite\n                  for the U.S. Senate with some anti-Nebraska politicians.  Lincoln, Shields,Lyman Trumbull, andJoel A. Mattesonwere the main contenders when the General Assembly met in joint session on February\n                  8, 1855 to elect Illinois’ next U.S. Senator.   Trumbull, an anti-Nebraska Democrat,\n                  won the seat.  Preston cast his vote for Shields until the seventh ballot, when he\n                  switched to Matteson.  See1854 Federal Election.Powers’ prediction that the Democrats would try to “stave off” an election if they\n                  could not elect a pro-Nebraska politician did not prove accurate; in fact, it was\n                  the anti-Nebraska forces that attempted to delay the election when Shields pulled\n                  even with Lincoln after the third ballot.Stephen T. Loganmotioned for the adjournment of the joint session, but members refused to adjourn\n                  by a vote of 56 to 42.  Of the forty-one legislators who voted for Lincoln on the\n                  third ballot, only one--George F. Foster--voted against adjourning the session.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L. Scripps; Rodney O.
