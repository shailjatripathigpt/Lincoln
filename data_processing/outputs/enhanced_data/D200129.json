When the ballots were\n                  finally tallied in August 1838, Stuart defeated Douglas by a scant 36 votes (18,254\n                  for Stuart to 18,218 for Douglas). The closeness of the vote and accusations of voter\n                  irregularities prompted Douglas to contest the election, to no avail.Robert W. Johannsen,Stephen A.
