        "text": "2“Dower” is a term that refers to the legally protected lifetime right of a woman to\n                  one-third of her husband’s lands and personal property. Dower was intended to provide\n                  for the support of a widow and her children. Because of this, a husband could not\n                  convey property without the consent of his wife.\n                  Conveyance is the transfer of title to land from one person, or class of persons,\n                  to another by deed or other written instrument.Christopher A.
