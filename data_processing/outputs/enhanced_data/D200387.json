Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective\n                  Whig congressmen. Hardin and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed that the\n                  1846 nomination should have been his. While Hardin delayed officially announcing his\n                  candidacy, Lincoln set out to solidify his own support. In response, Hardin proposed\n                  that the convention system for the nomination be thrown out in favor of a primary\n                  election between himself and Lincoln. This letter was Lincoln’s response. It was published\n                  in theSangamo Journalon February 26, 1846, alongside Hardin’s proposal and his subsequent rejection of\n                  the nomination.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:218, 231, 233;Abraham Lincoln to Henry E.
