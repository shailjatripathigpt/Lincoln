        "text": "2Lincoln and Thomas were referencing a letter from General Antonio de Lopez Santa Anna\n                  to President Andrew Jackson dated  July 4, 1836.  This correspondence was part of\n                  the aftermath of the Texas Revolution of 1836.  On April 21, 1836, Texas forces routed\n                  Santa Anna and his army at the Battle of San Jacinto, and on April 22, the Texans\n                  took Santa Anna prisoner.  On May 14, Santa Anna signed two treaties, one public and\n                  one private, which together became known as the Treaty of Velasco.  In the public\n                  treaty, he agreed to end hostilities, and in the private and confidential agreement\n                  he agreed to work to persuade the Mexican government to accept Texan independence.\n                  In exchange for these treaties, the Texans agreed to free Santa Anna and allow him\n                  to return toMexico.  The Mexican Government, however, repudiated the public agreement, arguing that\n                  it was invalid because Santa Anna was a prisoner when it was concluded.  Santa Anna\n                  remained a prisoner, and he wrote President Jackson on July 4, requesting his assistance\n                  in securing his release and in ending hostilities between Texas and Mexico.  He enclosed\n                  copies of the public and private agreements.  Jackson penned a sympathetic response\n                  on September 4, regretting that he could neither affect Santa Anna’s release nor interfere\n                  in the conflict unless the governments of the contending parties requested the United\n                  States’ good offices.  Jackson, in the meantime, was working behind the scenes to\n                  insure Santa Anna’s safety and American neutrality over Texan independence.  In a\n                  letter toLewis Casson September 5, Jackson cautioned that his correspondence and the secret agreement\n                  were not to be made public.Will Fowler,Santa Anna of Mexico(Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2007), 171-73, 175, 176, 177-81,  378; Robert\n                     V.

        "text": "3On January 14, 1837, SenatorJohn Davismoved a resolution calling upon President Jackson to submit to the Senate any correspondence\n                  between him and Santa Anna, or any other person authorized to act on the behalf of\n                  Mexico, “respecting the independence or future disposition and civil condition of\n                  Texas.”  The resolution also called for any correspondence between foreign governments\n                  on the Texas issue.  On January 16, the Senate adopted the resolution.  On January\n                  19, Jackson complied with the resolution by submitting a copy and a translation of\n                  Santa Anna’s July 4 letter, along with his reply of September 4.  “No other communication\n                  on the subject of the resolution,” Jackson wrote in his letter of transmission dated\n                  January 18, “referred to has been made to the Executive by any other foreign Government,\n                  or by any person claiming to act in behalf of Mexico.”   Jackson did not include a\n                  copy of the Treaty of Velasco.  Ironically, Santa Anna had been released and was on\n                  his way toWashington, DC, to meet with President Jackson.  Santa Anna arrived in Washington on January 17,\n                  and met with Jackson on January 19.There are minor differences in the correspondence as recorded in theCongressional Globeand in the 1931 edition of Jackson’s correspondence.U.S. SenateJournal. 1837. 24th Cong., 2nd sess., 116-17, 121, 136;Cong. Globe, 24th Cong., 2nd Sess., 98,  108-9   (1837); Robert V.
