        "text": "4Lincoln is discussing depositions related to the caseKemper v. Adams & Bovey. In the case,John H. Kemperrecovered a judgment against William F. Bradshaw, and the U.S. marshal sold Bradshaw's\n                  land inOgle County, Illinois, to satisfy the judgment.  Bradshaw conveyed the land to Adam Adams and John Bovey.\n                  Adams and Bovey had possession of the land that Kemper claimed to own by virtue of\n                  the judgment.  Kemper sued Adams and Bovey in an action of ejectment in theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinois, to remove them from the property.  Adams and Bovey retained Lincoln, Turner, andSolon Cumins; Kemper retained Stephen T. Logan. Lincoln and his fellow attorneys for the defense\n                  argued that the time during which Kemper could sue had expired.  The court found for\n                  Kemper.  By virtue of anactpromulgated in March 1839, the  losing party in an ejectment case was entitled to\n                  one new trial simply by paying the court costs, and Adams and Bovey  paid the costs\n                  and motioned for a new trial.  The court granted the motion.Lincoln initially informed both Turner and Adam Adams of Logan’s preference to postpone\n                  the case in letters he wrote each of them in late-June 1853. In hisletterto Turner, he also discussed the bill of exceptions he references here. In American\n                  law, a bill of exceptions is a formal, written list of objections to a trial judge’s\n                  instructions, decisions, or rulings. The trial judge signs and seals the bill and\n                  places the objections upon the court’s official record.Kemper v. Adams & Bovey, Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition,  2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),http://www.lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Details.aspx?case=140935;Abraham Lincoln to Adam Adams; “Bill of Exceptions,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

        "text": "8When the case came to trial again, the jury found for Kemper.  Adams and Bovey apparently\n                  sued Kemper for an injunction to stop the execution of the judgment, and in March\n                  1858, theU.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois, ruled for Adams and Bovey.  Lincoln received $100 for his legal services.As indicated in anotherletterto Turner, Lincoln first became involved in the lawsuit in December 1849.  He wrote\n                  multiple letters to Turner, Adams, Bovey, and Cumins regarding this case before its\n                  conclusion in 1858.For the letters related to this case, seeKemper v.
