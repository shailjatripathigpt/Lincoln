        "text": "3On July 24, Lincoln had challenged Douglas to a series of formal debates. The Illinois\n                  press published much of the correspondence between Douglas and Lincoln on the subject.\n                  The letter Walker references is most likely Douglas’ first reply to Lincoln, in which\n                  Douglas stated that he and the Democratic State Committee had already made speaking\n                  arrangements for him through late-October and that the arrangements scheduled “will\n                  occupy the whole time of the day and evening and leave no opportunity for other speeches.”\n                  Douglas nevertheless eventually agreed to debate Lincoln, resulting in the famousLincoln-Douglas Debates.Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.

        "text": "4Although Lincoln declined to speak in Havana the same day as Douglas (August 13),\n                  he delivered a campaign address in Havana on August 14. For the first part of theelection campaign of 1858, Lincoln had often followed Douglas on the  trail, delivering speeches either later\n                  in the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. In an August 2letterto Joseph Eccles, however, Lincoln noted that in correspondence Douglas had indicated\n                  that “my presence, on the days or evenings of his meetings would be considered an\n                  intrusion.” Douglas’ intimation was most likely why Lincoln addressed Havana the day\n                  after Douglas rather than on the same day, as Walker had originallysuggested.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in the U.S. Senate. Lincoln received forty-six votes in the General Assembly, but\n                  Douglas received fifty-one votes and retained the senate seat. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:483-85, 556-57;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 13 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-13; 14 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-14; Allen C.
