        "text": "1On January 7, 1837, Usher F. Linder  proposed for adoption a resolution calling for\n                  the appointment of a select committee of seven persons to investigate the State Bank\n                  of Illinois.  The House tabled the resolution and ordered 150 copies printed by a\n                  vote of 61 yeas to 14 nays, with Abraham Lincoln voting yea. On January 11, the House\n                  agreed to allow Linder to move to take up the resolution by a vote of  55 yeas to\n                  21 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House then agreed to take up the resolution\n                  by a vote of 57 yeas to 24 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  Lincoln’s remarks came\n                  in the midst of the ensuing debate.Illinois HouseJournal. 1836. 10th G. A., 1st sess., 195-99, 235-36."

        "text": "7In 1831, the General Assembly had authorized borrowing $100,000 from Samuel Wiggins\n                  to replenish the school fund, from which the legislature had borrowed to pay state\n                  expenses, and to redeem State Bank of Illinois bank notes, which the state had purchased\n                  at a heavy discount and which became due in 1831 at face value in specie.After debate on the resolution, the House referred it to the Committee of the Whole.\n                  On January 18, the House discharged the Committee of the Whole from further consideration.\n                  Linder proposed to amend the resolution by striking out all after the word “Resolved”\n                  and inserting a substitute calling for a select committee of five to investigate the\n                  bank.John J. Hardincountered with his own substitute calling for the House and Senate finance committees\n                  to conduct the inquiry.  Hardin later modified his substitute making it a joint select\n                  committee of three members of the House and two from the Senate. The House rejected\n                  Hardin’ substitute as modified by a vote of 39 yeas to 45 nays, with Lincoln voting\n                  yea.  The House refused to refer the resolution and Linder’s proposed substitute to\n                  a select committee by a vote of 23 yeas to 60 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The\n                  House rejected Lincoln’s motion to amend the proposed substitute by striking out the\n                  word “organization” by a vote of 34 yeas to 44 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  After\n                  several procedural votes, the House agreed to strike out the original resolution by\n                  a vote of 76 yeas to 10 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The House agreed to insert\n                  Linder’s substitute by a vote of 66 yeas to 21 nays, with Lincoln voting nay. On January\n                  19, the Senate adopted two resolutions, one that mirrored Hardin’s substitute as modified\n                  calling for a joint select committee to inquire into  the condition and financial\n                  dealings of the State Bank, and the second calling for a joint select committee to\n                  inquire into the affairs of the Bank of Illinois.  The House amended the resolution\n                  on the State Bank  and adopted the resolution as amended by a vote of 70 yeas to 10\n                  nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House also adopted the second resolution by a\n                  vote of 44 yeas to 35 yeas, with Lincoln voting nay.  On January 20, the Senate concurred\n                  in the House amendments.  On February 18, the joint select committee appointed to\n                  investigate the State Bank issued its report.Reg Ankrom,Stephen A.
