Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Ewing wrote this letter in response to aletterAbraham Lincoln wrote him on June 22, 1849. Edwards became angry that Lincoln joined\n                  the competition for the position, and filed a letter with theU.S. Department of the Interioragainst Lincoln and in favor of Butterfield. This pained Lincoln, who requested this\n                  letter from Ewing in the hopes that it would help remove Edwards’ bad impression of\n                  him. Ewing, however, does not directly address the topic of Edwards’ candidacy  in\n                  this letter.Abraham Lincoln to Joseph Gillespie;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing."
