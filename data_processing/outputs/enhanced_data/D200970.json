        "text": "3Jesse K. Dubois’ response, if he wrote one, has not been located.In April 1857, LincolnwroteDubois a letter in which he provided Dubois advice regarding the latter’s legal obligations\n                  as state auditor for Illinois.Although it is unclear precisely which banks Lincoln is referring to in this letter,\n                  the stock depreciation that he references may have been related to thePanic of 1857. Several sections of banking legislation that theIllinois General Assemblypassed in both 1851 and 1857 were relevant to Dubois as state auditor and to the\n                  state’s bank commissioners. According to sections ten and seventeen of the 1851 legislation,\n                  the state’s bank commissioners were required to verify the values of banks’ stock\n                  shares annually, and it was illegal for the state auditor or others to countersign\n                  bills or notes “to any amount, in the aggregate exceeding the public stock deposited\n                  with the auditor” as security on the bank. Furthermore, per section thirty-two, if\n                  the bank commissioners determined that a bank’s securities had decreased in value\n                  and were therefore “insufficient as security for the redemption of bills or circulations,”\n                  the 1851 banking law required the bank commissioners to notify the president and cashier\n                  of the bank of this issue and require the bank to transfer or deposit other securities\n                  to make up for the original securities’ decrease in value. If a bank failed to comply,\n                  the state auditor was legally authorized to place that bank into liquidation.Per the 1857 banking law, the state auditor was required to verify that a bank had\n                  a minimum of $50,000 cash capital on hand before issuing any notes or bills on behalf\n                  of that bank.Illinois HouseJournal. 1851. 17th G. A., 486; “An Act to Establish a General System of Banking,” 15 February\n                     1851,General Laws of Illinois(1851),      165-67, 171-72; “An Act to Amend ‘An Act to Establish a General System\n                     of Banking,’ Passed February 15th, 1851, and the Acts Amendatory Thereof,” 14 February\n                     1857,Laws of Illinois(1857),      25."
