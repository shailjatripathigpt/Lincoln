        "text": "2TheIllinois State Journaladvertised the referenced court case of theCircuit Court of Sangamon County, announcing that a subpoena in chancery was issued byThomasandSarah Correlland other complainants against James H. McDaniel and other defendants, returnable\n                  the first day of the next term of the court, the third Monday in October.James H. McDaniel’s sistersSarah, Mary Ann, and Martha, along with their husbands, sued him and his brotherJoseph, as well as other heirs of their father, William McDaniel, in March 1855 in Sangamon\n                  County Circuit Court in a chancery action to set aside the father’s will. Lincoln\n                  served as a defense attorney alongsideWilliam H. HerndonandJames C. Conkling. The plaintiffs argued that James and Joseph took advantage of their dying, mentally\n                  incompetent father and got him drunk to secure the most favorable inheritance in his\n                  will. The sisters also stated that their father’s widow had renounced the will’s provisions\n                  and had already received her dower. The jury found for the sisters and voided William\n                  McDaniel’s will based on his mental incompetency in November 1855.Lincoln’s team appealed to theIllinois Supreme Court, which heard the case and reversed the decision in December 1857 on the grounds that\n                  the non-resident minor defendants were neither properly summoned nor represented in\n                  the proceedings. The Court remanded the case back to the circuit court, ruling on\n                  the necessity of including all defendants but not on the legality of the will.James H. McDaniel is referring to the remanded case in the Sangamon Circuit Court\n                  that began in August 1858. The judgment, passed down in April 1863, found for the\n                  original defendants, including the McDaniel brothers, and validated their father William’s\n                  will.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 August 1858, 2:5;Correll et al. v.
