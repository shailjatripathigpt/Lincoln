The vote was reconsidered accordingly; when Mr.Murphy, ofPerry, moved to lay the resolution on the table. He said the resolution was unconstitutional;\n\nthat that instrument only contemplated the exclusion of members from offices which\n\nwere created by themselves; and he saw no reason why they should not be elected as\n\nwell as others. For his part he would not abide by any such decision as the House\n\nmade yesterday; and he hoped the matter would be dropped. Mr.Happysaid, he would like to see gentlemen walk up to this question boldly, and meet it\n\nlike men. Why wish to shrink from the responsibility of a direct vote on this question?\n\nGentlemen knew very well how to dodge. The people were to be deceived, by these side\n\nway questions. Lay the resolution on the table, and what then? Why, the people could\n\nbe told it was informal, or almost any thing else, to shield gentlemen. Surely, they\n\nwere prepared to vote directly for or against the resolution. They would never have\n\na better time. They had all kind of chances. All night they had had the opportunity\n\nof drilling members. They could scare the timid, encourage the wavering, and use\n\nall the power of numbers by appealing to the hopes of many. They have doubtless done\n\ntheir best to defeat this resolution. All their fine expectations of office, have\n\nimpelled them to use every means to destroy a proposition, which seemed to be in their\n\nway. Now, let them come up, and vote like men—vote direct, so that the people might\n\nsee their votes; but not try to ward it off by an indirect vote to lie on the table.\n\nFor his part he could tell them, all their efforts had not changed his mind. After several other remarks, by various members, the vote was taken on laying on the\n\ntable, and decided in the negative—yeas 41, nays 43.—Mr.Webb, ofWhite, then moved to refer the resolution to the committee on the Judiciary. He said his\n\nonly object was, to havehe matter investigated by that committee; and if it could be done, he wished a bill\n\nreported which would cover the whole case. He approved of the objects of the resolution;\n\nbut he would prefer a law which would remedy the evil; for an evil it was, and it\n\nwas growing rapidly. Already he had no doubt almost every office was apportioned\n\nout among the members. He hoped they would be disappointed, and that the majority\n\nof this House would oppose the election of any member. But he believed it ought to\n\nbe made the law of the land; and hence he moved the reference to the committee on\n\nthe Judiciary. Several amendments were proposed and voted down, when the House finally refused to\n\nrefer. Other references were proposed, and several acrimonious speeches made; but\n\nall failing, Mr.Lincolnmoved its reference to the committee on Internal Improvements. Mr.Smith, ofWabash, and Mr.Thornton, both seemed to regard this as a direct attack on them. They were members of this\n\ncommittee, interested in the decision; and they would not allow the insinuation.\n\nThey would hold thegentleman from Sangamonresponsible, &c. &c. Mr. Lincoln replied, he did not move the reference with any\n\nsuch design as had been attributed to him. He had always been the friend of both\n\nthe gentlemen; and at the last extra session he had voted against such a proposition,\n\nbecause hisfriend from Wabashwas personally interested then in the decision, being at that time in the employ\n\nof the State. But he would now assure the gentlemen, that the proposition to refer\n\ndid not originate with him. He was requested to make the motion by one of their especial\n\nfriends, and a member of the same committee, viz: the gentleman from Perry, (Mr. Murphy,)\n\nand to oblige him he had made the motion. But he was glad he had made it; the hydra\n\nwas exposed; and all the talk about settling this matter at another tribunal, he had\n\nno objection to, if gentlemen insisted on it. He was always ready, and never shrunk\n\nfrom responsibility.—Mr.Bakersaid that this matter was assuming rather a serious character. He had opposed the\n\nresolution originally, because he was not satisfied of the extent of the evil. But\n\nthe warmth of debate, and the anxiety shown to stifle the proposition in certain quarters,\n\nhad satisfied him of the necessity of prompt action in the premises.

On December 20, the topic was brought up again by\n                  McMillan, who moved that his resolution be reconsidered. It was rejected, but later\n                  in the day, Archibald Williams proposed a similarresolution. House members debated the resolution, eventually amending it to add “We deprecate,\n                  further, the practice of appointing them to offices in either of the Banks in this\n                  State,” and ”And also the appointment of members of the Legislature by the Board of\n                  Public Works to any office in their gift.” The House then adopted the resolution by\n                  a vote of 44 ayes to 42 nays, with Abraham Lincoln voting aye.Illinois HouseJournal.  1838. 11th G.
