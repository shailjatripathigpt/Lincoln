        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Rives has not been located, but it was likely similar to hislettertoThomas A. Marshallfrom April 23, 1858. In that letter, Lincoln discussed the 1858 Illinois Senate race\n                  in his bid to find supporters of hisU.S. Senaterun againstStephen A. Douglas. Abraham Lincoln was the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate.  At the time,\n                  state legislatures chose members of the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for\n                  theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to, Douglas, the\n                  incumbent.
