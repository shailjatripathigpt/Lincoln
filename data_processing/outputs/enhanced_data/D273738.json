Fourth. Books shall be opened inNew Yorkand inLondonfor a subscription of, say five and a half million dollars for the construction\n\nof said railroad to be paid in instalments as required. The holders of Illinois Internal\n\nImprovement Bonds shall in the flrst place have the right to subscribe the amount, and as an inducement so to do, after\n\nthe re-payment of the loan thus subscribed from the revenues of the said Railroad\n\nand lands, the bonds held by the said subscribing bondholders and the interest thereon\n\nshall be next paid by the said Trustees from the revenues of the said Railroad and\n\nlands in proportion to the amount subscribed by the said bondholders respectively. Fifth. After a sufficient amount shall be subscribed as aforesaid for the completion of\n\nsaid road, the said subscribers hall elect three Trustees who shall hold their office for three years and until their\n\nsuccessors shall be elected. And the Governor shall convey by deed the said Railroad\n\nand lands to the said Trustees, who shall receive the money thus subscribed and complete\n\nthe said Railroad, and manage the same, impose and collect the toll, sell and dispose\n\nof the lands and out of the revenues thus derived shall first re-pay the said loan\n\nand interest: and secondly, pay off the State Bonds held by the subscribing bondholders. Sixth. After all the aforesaid debts have been paid off with the interest thereon and all\n\ncosts of construction and repairs, and all incidental expenses the said railroad shall\n\nrevert to the State. REMARKS. 1st. As an inducement to Congress to make the donation of land, the troops of the\n\nU.S. and munitions of war shall at all times be transported upon the road free of\n\nexpense to the U.S., and the U.S. mail shall be carried upon the said road at as low\n\na rate as they may be contracted to be carried on other railroads. 2d. The inducement to the State is sufficient to grant the road and lands to Trustees,\n\nas it secures a provision for paying off all the Internal Improvement debt of the\n\nState, which amounted on the 1st of July 1847, to $8,164,948, including all arrears\n\nof interest. 3d. The inducement to the Bondholders to subscribe the amount to complete the road\n\nis sufficient, as the value of the lands and work done on the road will be ample security,\n\nit will raise their bonds (which are now depressed) to nearly par value and secure\n\ntheir payment. 4th. New York and all the Eastern cities will have a great inducement to aid in this\n\nscheme, as by running their railroad to Chicago, it will connect them with a railroad\n\nrunning through the most productive valley of the Upper and Lower Mississippi, and\n\nunites them with Illinois,Michigan,IowaandWisconsin. The first step to be taken is to petition Congress for the donation of lands equal\n\nto every alternate section for a space of five miles wide upon each side of the said\n\nroad from one end to the other. It is believed that there will be no difficulty in\n\nobtaining this grant at the ensuing session of Congress. This railroad running through\n\nthe State from the Southern to the Northern extreme, and uniting both with the lakes,\n\nwill unite all the people of the State and our whole delegation in Congress in its\n\nsupport; we can calculate upon the support of this measure from the delegates in Congress,\n\nfrom all the Western and Eastern States. It will be in fact a great National work,\n\nuniting the Mississippi with the Atlantic cities. Persons to whom the annexed Petitions\n\nare sent, are respectfully requested to circulate the same for signatures, without\n\ndelay, and forward the same to the Representatives in Congress from their District,\n\nor Senators from their State atWashington.

The said road will be aboutfive hundred milesin length, traversing the most rich and fertile lands from one extreme of the State\n\nto the other, a large portion of which, espeeially in the southern part of the State, are owned by the United States. This road will\n\nfurnish facilities for travel and transportation for Iilinois, Galena. Wisconsin. and the vast territory yet to be settled on the West of the Mississippi,\n\nit will connect the great grain producing valley of the Mississippi when our lakes\n\nand rivers are locked up by ice, with the Gulf of Mexico, and with our Atlantic cities\n\nby means of connecting Rail Roads, which are now stretching out and extending Westward\n\nfrom the Atlamic sea board it will encourage agriculture, promote commerce and manufactures, enhance\n\nthe value and expedite the sale of the public lands, tend to the improvement and prosperity\n\nof the country, and the strengthening the bond of our Union. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honorable body to aid in the construction\n\nof the said road, will grant to the State of Illinois, the right of way and a quantity\n\nof the public lands equal to every alternate section for five miles wide on each side\n\nof the said road, from one end to the other; and where in consequence of sales having\n\nbeen made by the United States, it is not practicable to locate the whole of the said\n\nlands by alternate sections on the line of the said road, that the State may have\n\nthe right to locate the residue on any of the unsold lands in market within the State:—your\n\npetitioners are willing that conditions should be attached to the grant, for the free\n\ntransportation of the troops and munitions of war of the United States, upon said\n\nroad, and for just provisions in relation to transporting the mails, and to ensure\n\na faithful application of the lands by the State, to the completion of the said road,\n\nthat the State shall be restrained from selling or disposing of the said lands faster\n\nthan and in proportion to such parts of the said road as shall from time to time be\n\ncompleted, and that the State shall grant no pre-emption rights to any of said lands.\n\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray.2",
