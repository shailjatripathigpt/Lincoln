        "text": "2Lincoln was not alone in questioning the patronage policy of the Taylor administration;\n                  conflicts and complaints over the distribution of patronage dominated the first nine\n                  months of the Taylor presidency.  Zachary Taylor had positioned himself as a candidate\n                  above or unbound by party affiliation, but this proved easier in making policy than\n                  in distributing jobs.  The federal civil service had grown to over 18,000, and Whigs,\n                  out of power since 1840, were eager to reap the rewards of thevictory in 1848.  The pool of applicants was vast, however, and Whigs often squabbled over who was\n                  most deserving of accommodation.  Many Democrats also voted for Taylor, and they wanted\n                  Taylor to make good on his pledge to be a president of all Americans.  Taylor did\n                  seek to broaden support for his administration by offering appointments to both Whigs\n                  and Democrats, but the administration’s inept handling of patronage irritated both\n                  groups.  Whigs divided bitterly over patronage, and Democrats, led by its press, continually\n                  condemned President Taylor’s patronage policies as  a betrayal of his promise of bipartisanship.Michael F. Holt,The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of\n                        the Civil War(New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 414-19; Elbert B.
