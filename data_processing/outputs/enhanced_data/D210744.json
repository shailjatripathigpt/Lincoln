        "text": "3The work focuses on the First (1816-1818) andSecond (1835-1843)Seminole wars. Giddings, anabolitionist, defines the exiles as the enslaved persons of African and Native American descent\n                  who fled to Spanish Florida and later theFlorida Territory to become free under Spanish law. Enslaved people often ended up in territory claimed\n                  by the Seminole Nation, leading to tension between the United States and the slaveholders,\n                  who launched cross-borders raids to regain their slaves.  These skirmishes eventually\n                  lead to war between the U.S. Army and the Seminole.  Giddings describes the result\n                  of the Florida migration and the U.S. Government's response: \"At a time of profound\n                  peace, ourarmy, acting under the direction of theExecutive, invaded Florida, murdered many of these free men, and brought others to the United\n                  States and consigned them to slavery.\"Joshua R.
