Lincoln had been acquainted with\n                  Reavis’ late father,Isham Reavis, Sr., having reputedly stayed at the elder Reavis’ farm on occasion when surveying in\n                  the 1830s, and having given a deposition in 1836 regarding a survey he did in a land\n                  sale dispute involving Isham Reavis, Sr. The younger Reavis may have been prompted\n                  to commence legal studies following the death of his mother, which had also caused\n                  him to cut short his studies atIllinois CollegeinJacksonville.Lincoln declined Reavis as legal apprentice, Martha L.

Dummer played\n                  a role in Reavis’ legal education, although an obituary for Reavis states that he\n                  commenced his studies in August of 1855 in a law office inBeardstown, where Dummer practiced at the time. At the end of his life, Reavis reminisced in\n                  a letter to his son that he was acquainted with Lincoln for the duration of his legal\n                  studies, but no further correspondence between the two has been located.John S.
