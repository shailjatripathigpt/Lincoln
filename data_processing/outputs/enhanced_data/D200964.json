        "text": "3Lincoln references the case ofYoung et al. v. Alvis et al.  In 1852, Andrew J. Morrison and William J. Alvis of Henderson County, Kentucky, contracted with Morrison's brother-in-law, William H. Young, to be their agent in\n                  land speculations inLogan County, Illinois. They agreed to allow Young to acquire $3,200 worth of land, chiefly through military\n                  land warrants. In 1857, Morrison and Alvis agreed to partition their 1,600 acres equally.\n                  Court records do not detail the nature of the suit, but Young and Morrison retained\n                  Lincoln and William H. Herndon and sued Alvis in theLogan County Circuit Courtregarding the partition.Young et al. v. Alvis et al.appeared on the judge’s docket for the September term of the Logan County Circuit\n                  Court, which commenced on September 21, 1857.  On September 20, 1857,Mary Lincolnwrote of her husband, “Mr. L. is not at home, this makes the fourth week, he has\n                  been in Chicago.” Lincoln was occupied with the “Effie Afton” case--Hurd et al. v. Rock Island Bridge Co.---which opened in the U.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois, on September\n                  8.  Lincoln was back in Springfield on Saturday, September 26.Judge’s Docket, Document ID: 41075,Young et al. v. Alvis et al., Martha L.

The case continued for several years.  Morrison\n                  died in 1859, Young died in 1863, and the court struck the case from the docket in\n                  October 1865.Young et al. v.
