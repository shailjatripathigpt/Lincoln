He and other prominent members of theIllinoisRepublican Party were canvassing the state delivering speeches to bolster the prospects\n                  of Republican candidates for theIllinois SenateandIllinois House of Representatives. This was in part because, at the time, Lincoln was the Illinois Republican Party’s\n                  candidate to replaceDemocraticincumbent Stephen A. Douglas in theU.S. Senateand members of the Illinois General Assembly voted for and elected thestate’s representatives in the U.S. Senate.  Douglas also crisscrossed the state on a similar\n                  speaking tour during the same period.

        "text": "4Throughout the campaign of 1858 Douglas played upon his audiences’ racism, frequently\n                  asserting that Lincoln and other Republicans were abolitionists who desired political\n                  equality of the races and interracial marriage. He also attacked Lincoln and other\n                  Republicans’ criticism of theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision inScott v. Sandford, arguing that any criticism of the court’s decision was evidence of a desire for\n                  the “amalgamation” of the races. Lincoln countered such attacks repeatedly throughout\n                  the campaign, including during the firstLincoln-Douglas Debatejust four days prior to his Macomb speech, asserting that although he believed that\n                  the Declaration of Independence applied to all men—not just white men—he did not favor\n                  full social and political equality between the races, nor did he intend to abolish\n                  slavery.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:439-41, 501, 506, 510-11; First Debate with Stephen A.

Sometimes the clubs were new,\n                  and sometimes they emerged from existing clubs that were originally organized for\n                  the Whig Party or theAmerican Party. Some of these Republican clubs called themselves Lincoln clubs; others were simply\n                  local Republican Party clubs.
