        "text": "4Ever since PresidentAndrew Jacksonmade broad use of the veto power to reject internal improvements,  aNational Bank, and other parts ofHenry Clay’s American System, the Whigs had railed against “executive usurpation.” Congressional\n                  supremacy became a mantra for the Whig Party, and Whig orators made what they deemed\n                  unconstitutional use of the veto power by Jackson's successors a theme in most elections\n                  up to 1848. In the presidential campaign of 1848, Whigs sought to mobilize their supporters\n                  and gain neutral voters by claiming thatLewis Cass, theDemocraticcandidate, would continueJames K. Polk’s unconstitutional usurpation of power, most notably in commencing and waging theMexican War.Anti-slavery and some regular Whigs condemned the nomination of Taylor, a southern\n                  slaveholder who had no previous political affiliation, as an abandonment of Whig principles.\n                  Like Henry Clay, many refused to endorse Taylor and participate in the campaign.Norma Lois Peterson,The Presidencies of William Henry Harrison & John Tyler(Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1989), 14, 89-90, 97; Michael F.
