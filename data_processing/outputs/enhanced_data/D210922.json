Lincoln was the IllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace Democratic incumbentStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senate, and, during theLincoln-Douglas Debates, the two men exchanged numerous arguments on the topic. Douglas and other Democrats\n                  had long argued that the Declaration of Independence did not apply to African Americans.\n                  Lincoln, on the other hand, asserted that “there is no reason in the world why the\n                  negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence,\n                  the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”Julian P.
