Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to his political\n                  allies seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

        "text": "6The state’s voters in the elections of 1854 sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the\n                  Illinois General Assembly. The presence of an anti-Nebraska majority gave opponents\n                  of Stephen A. Douglas and the Democrats leverage in the imminent elections for General\n                  Assembly officers and U.S. Senator. In the senate election, incumbent James Shields,\n                  a supporter of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, was up for reelection, and the anti-Nebraska\n                  forces relished the opportunity to replace him with one of their own.Lincoln and Williams both became candidates for U.S. Senate when the General Assembly\n                  gathered in joint session to vote on February 8, 1855. Williams received votes on\n                  the second, third, fourth, ninth, and tenth ballots. Lincoln received a majority of\n                  the anti-Nebraska votes until the tenth and final ballot, when he withdrew and urged\n                  his supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With the votes\n                  of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat.  See1854 Federal Election.  Judge William C. Rice cast his vote for Lincoln for eight ballots before switching\n                  to Trumbull in the last two ballots.Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.
