        "text": "2Henry C. Whitney’sletterto Lincoln andWilliam H. Herndonof July 31, 1858, reported the rumor of a movement to challenge Republican candidates\n                  in Bureau and La Salle counties in the state elections of 1858 in this manner. Lincoln\n                  himself had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of particular importance to Lincoln’s campaign. See1858 Federal Election.Despite Whitney’s and Lincoln’s concerns about the electoral races in Bureau and La\n                  Salle counties, the Republican candidates for these offices were ultimately successful.\n                  AlthoughChurchill Coffingwas put forward as an independent candidate for the Third Congressional District\n                  of Illinois, he withdrew from the race in October, 1858 and incumbent RepublicanOwen Lovejoydefeated DouglasDemocratGeorge W. Armstrong andBuchananDemocrat David Le Roy.Republican candidates also won the three seats in the Illinois General Assembly that\n                  were up for election in these counties in 1858. Bureau and La Salle counties were\n                  both in the Seventh Illinois Senate District, where Cook himself held over in the\n                  election of 1858. Bureau County comprised the Forty-Seventh Illinois House District,\n                  where RepublicanJohn H. Bryantwon the election with 2,570 votes, while his opponents, Buchanan Democrat Thomas\n                  Tustin (Tusten) and Douglas Democrat Benjamin L. Smith received 786 and 611 votes\n                  respectively. No evidence has been found of an independent candidate running in the\n                  Forty-Seventh House District. La Salle County was in the Forty-Third Illinois House\n                  District, in which RepublicansAlexander CampbellandRichardson S. Hickearned 4,139 and 4,089 votes respectively, defeating Democratic candidates Samuel\n                  C. Collins and William Cogswell, who earned 3,383 and 3,412 votes respectively. Two\n                  other unidentified candidates named McBurney and Hoffman appeared in the election\n                  returns for the Forty-Third House District in this race. Their party affiliations\n                  are not indicated, and they received only 29 and 22 votes respectively.Allen C.
