On January\n                  25, the committee reported back the bill without amendment and recommended its passage.\n                  The Senate passed the bill, and sent to theIllinois House of Representativesfor consideration.The House took up the bill on January 27 and referred it to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n                  On January 31, the committee reported back the bill with a substitute, which the House\n                  passed and returned to the Senate. The Senate approved the House substitution the\n                  same day, and the bill became law on February 3, 1853.The law carried the same title as Lincoln’s original bill but differed from his bill\n                  in that it excluded Piatt County from the list of counties that comprised the Eighth\n                  Judicial Circuit. This impacted the terms that Lincoln had proposed for both the spring\n                  and fall. The  law moved Champaign County’s spring term to one week after DeWitt County’s\n                  spring term and Champaign County’s fall term to one week after DeWitt County’s fall\n                  term. In all other respects, the law passed was the same as the bill that Lincoln\n                  wrote.Illinois SenateJournal. 1853. 18th G. A., 160, 162, 227-28; Illinois HouseJournal. 1853. 18th G.
