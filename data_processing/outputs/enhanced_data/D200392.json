        "text": "2At a Whig convention in Pekin in May 1843, an agreement was made between Lincoln,Edward D. Baker, and John J. Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective\n                  Whig congressmen. Hardin and Baker having each served one term, Lincoln believed that\n                  the 1846 nomination should have been his. While Lincoln set out to solidify his support\n                  in the district, Hardin proposed that the convention system for the nomination be\n                  thrown out in favor of a primary election. LincolnrejectedHardin’s proposal on January 19, 1846, and Hardin subsequently declined the nomination\n                  entirely.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 2:218, 231;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 26 February 1846, 2:1-2.No issues of theMorgan Journalfor February 1846 are extant; however, the article was copied in the February 14\n                  issue of theIllinois Gazette. The author, who signed as “A Member of the Pekin Convention of 1843,” made public\n                  for the first time Hardin’s proposal to change from a nominating convention to a primary\n                  election, and also Lincoln’s rejection of the proposal.The Illinois Gazette(Lacon), 14 February 1846, 2:3-4."
