        "text": "3Crittenden is referencing the conflict within the Democratic Party over the Lecompton\n                  Constitution. During the agitation over whether to admit Kansas as a free or slave\n                  state, pro-slavery Kansans held a constitutional convention inLecomptonfrom September 7 to November 8, 1857, drafting a constitution guaranteeing slaveholders\n                  already in the territory their property rights and leaving the decision whether to\n                  allow new slaves into the territory to voters in a referendum. Voters could vote for\n                  the “constitution with slavery” or the “constitution without slavery,” but were not\n                  offered the opportunity to accept or reject the constitution as a whole. On December\n                  21, 1857, Kansans voting in the referendum on the Lecompton Constitution--free state\n                  Kansans abstained from participating--cast 6,226 votes for Lecompton with slavery\n                  and 569 for it without slavery amid charges of voter fraud. On January 4, 1858, however,\n                  Kansans voting in elections called by the anti-slavery legislature--pro-slavery Kansans\n                  abstained from participating-- overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution.\n                  Despite opposition in Kansas and considerable backlash from Republicans and the anti-slavery\n                  faction in the Democratic Party, PresidentJames Buchanansupported the Lecompton Constitution, urging that Kansas be admitted into the Union\n                  under the its terms. Stephen A. Douglas opposed it, however, bringing him into conflict\n                  with Buchanan. Buchanan warned Douglas that he faced political reprisals if he opposed\n                  the administration, but Douglas defied the president, arguing in a speech before the\n                  U.S. Senate that the Lecompton Constitution did not reflect the will of the actual\n                  inhabitants of Kansas, citing the December 21, 1857 vote that allowed voters to vote\n                  for the constitution but not against it. The Senate approved the Lecompton Constitution,\n                  but Republicans, Democratic allies of Douglas, and others, with Douglas as floor leader\n                  of the opposition, defeated it in theU.S. House of Representatives.

In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.An eminent formerWhig, Crittenden was widely regarded as the natural successor toHenry Clay, and Lincoln worried that a Crittenden endorsement for Douglas would hurt his chances\n                  with his former Whig brethren in Illinois. Crittenden welcomed Lincoln's rise to political\n                  prominence, but had little sympathy with theRepublican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-85, 542, 557; Allen\n                     C.

        "text": "5Despite this statement, Crittenden nonetheless became embroiled in the campaign for\n                  the U.S. Senate. On July 19,T. Lyle Dickey, a former Whig and Lincoln supporter who had defected to the Democrats and Douglas,\n                  wrote Crittenden requesting that he confirm a conversation with Dickey in April 1858\n                  where Crittenden praised Douglas. On August 1, Crittenden wrote Dickey confirming\n                  the conversation and his praise for Douglas's service to Illinois and his principled\n                  position on the Lecompton Constitution. Not wishing to be appear \"to be an officious\n                  intermeddler\" in the election, Crittenden requested that Dickey, should he speak of\n                  the conversation or letter, \"acquit me of any intermeddling, or of the presumption\n                  of seeking to obtrude myself or my sentiments upon the attention of the people of\n                  Illinois.\" Dickey kept the letter private until October 19, when he read it aloud\n                  in a speech denouncing Lincoln for abandoning Clay and Whiggery.The Daily Illinois State Journalsought to mitigate the damage by claiming that Crittenden's letter to Dickey was\n                  a forgery and by suggesting the Crittenden had written Lincoln supporting opposition\n                  against Douglas. TheDaily Missouri Republicandemanded that Lincoln publish this letter, which caused Crittenden, hewroteLincoln on October 27, \"much pain & surprise.\" TheIllinois State Journalcontinued to misrepresent Crittenden's correspondence to Lincoln, prompting Owen\n                  G. Cates ofSt. Louisto write Crittenden asking if he wrote such a letter. On October 28, Crittenden responded\n                  in a telegram: \"I have written no such letter.\" Crittenden's letter to Dickey, Dickey's\n                  speech, and Crittenden's subsequent telegram hurt Lincoln in the old Whig stronghold\n                  of central Illinois, contributing to Lincoln's loss to Douglas.David Davis,Henry C. Whitney, and others blamed Crittenden for Lincoln's defeat, and Lincoln himself, in a letter\n                  to Crittenden dated November 4, claimed that the use of Crittenden's name \"contributed\n                  largely\" to his loss.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:456-57, 542-43, 546-47; Allen C.
