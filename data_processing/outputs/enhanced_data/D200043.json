Obtaining payment for\n                  town lots sold in the new capital of Vandalia almost immediately became a problem.\n                  In January 1821, theGeneral Assemblygranted purchasers an additional twelve months to pay for their lots.  In February\n                  1827, the General Assembly gave purchasers of lots in Vandalia a 50 percent discount\n                  on the amount due.   In January 1829, the General Assembly extended the benefits of\n                  the 1827 act until August 1829, at which point any lots that were not paid in full\n                  would be forfeited to the state.   It also authorized the auditor of public accounts\n                  to sell any remaining lots in Vandalia. Four years later, the General Assembly directed\n                  the auditor of public accounts to have any unsold lots revalued by three persons and\n                  to offer the lots for sale at the new valuation.“An Act granting a donation of land to the state of Illinois, for the seat of government\n                     of said state,”  3 March 1819,Statutes at Large of the United States3 (1846):525; “An Act confirming the location of the seat of government of the state\n                     of Illinois, and for other purposes,”  2 March 1821,Statutes at Large of the United States3 (1846):618; “An Act approving and confirming the Proceedings of the Vandalia Commissioners,\n                     and for other Purposes,” 27 January 1821,Laws of Illinois(1821), 32-34; “An Act for the Relief of Purchasers of Town Lots in Vandalia,” 14\n                     February 1827,Revised Laws of Illinois(1827), 380-81; “An Act to Authorize the Auditor of Public Accounts to Sell Lots\n                     in the Town of Vandalia, and for Other Purposes,” 22 January 1829,Revised Laws of Illinois(1829), 188-89; “An Act relative to the Unsold Lots in the Town of Vandalia, and\n                     for Other Purposes,” 1 March 1833,Revised Laws of Illinois(1833), 605-06; Illinois HouseJournal. 1835. 9th G.
