        "text": "3At the outbreak of the Black Hawk War, Lincoln volunteered for theIllinois State Militia. On April 21, 1832, Lincoln and other men from theNew Salemarea were mustered into a company in theFourth Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers, and the members of the company elected Lincoln as their captain. When his month\n                  of service ended, Lincoln re-enlisted twice, for twenty and thirty days respectively,\n                  serving as a private both times. He was finally discharged on July 10, 1832.On September 28, 1850, theU.S. Congresspassed an act granting certain groups who had served in the United States military\n                  during theWar of 1812, any of “the Indian wars” since 1790, and theMexican Warparcels of public land. Per this act, the amount of land that veterans (or their\n                  legal heirs) were entitled to depended upon the length of engagement and actual time\n                  served. Lincoln was entitled to forty acres of public land for the time he served\n                  as captain of the Fourth Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers. He wasissuedthat land on June 1, 1855.Lincoln   received these 120 acres of land for his service during the Black Hawk War\n                  following the passage of the March 3, 1855, federal law  declaring that all who had\n                  served in any U.S. war since 1790 were entitled to 160 acres of land in total. These\n                  120 acres, added to the forty acres he had been issued in 1855, fulfilled the requirement\n                  of the new law.   This new land was located in Crawford County,Iowa, 144 miles west of his original forty acres. There is no evidence that Lincoln ever\n                  received any revenue from any of these bounty lands. After his assassination, since\n                  he did not leave a will, the initial forty acres of  land passed in one-third equal\n                  divisions toMary Lincoln,Robert T. Lincoln, andThomas “Tad” Lincoln. The Crawford County land also passed to the remaining Lincoln family.Muster Roll of Abraham Lincoln’s Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Captain Elijah Iles’ Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Captain Jacob M.
