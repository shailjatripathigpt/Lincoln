Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. Supporters of each candidate\n                  sent letters of reference and recommendation to both PresidentZachary Taylorand Secretary of the Interior Ewing. Although the U.S. Department of the Interior\n                  oversaw the U.S. General Land Office, President Taylor was ultimately responsible\n                  for appointing the commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office. In the end, the job\n                  went to Butterfield.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair."

        "text": "4In hisreplyto Ewing, dated July 27, 1849, Lincoln asserted that although several people who\n                  wrote letters of recommendation on his behalf discussed Butterfield, only Richard\n                  W. Thompson, Elisha Embree, and Anson G. Henry’s letters were withheld by the Department\n                  of the Interior. Neither Thompson, Embree, nor Henry’s letters of recommendation have\n                  been located. Lincoln suspected that  Thompson’s and Embree’s letters were purposefully\n                  omitted by someone at the Department of the Interior in order to give Butterfield\n                  an advantage over him in the competition for the job. However,  he laterwroteJohn Addisonthat his loyalty to both Taylor and “the greatwhigcause” induced him to remain silent about his suspicions.Lincoln and Ewing were able to discuss some of this information in person prior to\n                  this letter because, as competition for the job  intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, had urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. Lincoln arrived on or before June 19,\n                  1849.Eventually, on April 22, 1850, theDemocrat-controlledU.S. House of Representativesformed a committee underWilliam A. Richardsonto investigate Ewing’s role in and handling of patronage appointments as well as\n                  his management of pension payments and Department of the Interior accounts. On June\n                  8, 1850, theNew York Heraldreported that Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office was one patronage appointment that the Richardson Committee was investigating,\n                  particularly with regard to letters missing from the file on Lincoln that was shown\n                  to President Taylor prior to Taylor selecting the final appointee. However, when the\n                  Committee filed its final reports on September 4-7, 1850, it made no finding regarding\n                  Butterfield’s appointment. The Whig-controlledU.S. Senatealso exonerated Ewing of all charges, although suspicions remained in some Whig circles\n                  that Ewing had indeed suppressed letters of recommendation from Lincoln’s  file.William H.
