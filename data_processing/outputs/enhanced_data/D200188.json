He\n                  also wrote on page two the title and his name as part of the list of representatives\n                  considering the bill.On  December 17, 1839, Lincoln in theHouse of Representativespresented this petition of John Bennett, requesting vacation of the plat of part\n                  of Bennett’s addition in Petersburg.

        "text": "2Illinois experienced a time of intense land speculation in the 1830s that resulted\n                  in a number of  “paper towns,” settlements that were platted and available for sale\n                  but where few or no people actually lived. Many of the proprietors of these settlements\n                  abandoned them during and after thePanic of 1837. As a result, the General Assembly received a large number of petitions for vacation\n                  during their sessions from 1838 to 1841. In 1841, the legislature passed anactsetting parameters for proprietors to vacate town plats themselves. Vacating a plat\n                  gave owners greater flexibility in the use, fencing, and sale of the property.An Act to Vacate Town Plats; Alasdair Roberts,America’s First Great Depression: Economic Crisis and Political Disorder after the\n                        Panic of 1837(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2012), 19, 33, 38; James E.
