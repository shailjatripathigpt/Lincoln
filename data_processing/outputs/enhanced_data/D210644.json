        "text": "2Yates is referring to a movement to draft  William H. Bissell as a candidate to supplantJames Shieldsas U.S. Senator.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. \n                  Lincoln won election to the Illinois House of Representatives in the 1854 election,\n                  butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.When the General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, ten rounds of\n                  voting were needed to finally determine a victor. Bissell did not appear as a nominee.\n                  Lincoln received a majority of the anti-Nebraska votes until the tenth and final ballot,\n                  when he withdrew and urged his supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With the votes\n                  of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See1854 Federal Election.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

LucaswroteLincoln there was also a rumor circulating that members of theKnow Nothing Partyplanned to focus their support on Bissell, see him elected, then, afterward, Bissell\n                  would purportedly resign so that Shields could retain the seat.While Bissell did not become a nominee, Shields did. Shields came in first or second\n                  in the first six rounds of voting but was unable to acquire the fifty votes needed\n                  to be elected. In round seven of voting, Shields’ supporters plummeted to one vote,\n                  and he failed to receive any additional support as voting continued through ten rounds.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
