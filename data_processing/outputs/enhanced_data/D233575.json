        "text": "3Mark had written anotherletteron May 2 defending King.Mark addressed these letters to Abraham Lincoln because Lincoln had become embroiled\n                  in a controversy over King’s application for a position in theU.S. General Land Officein Springfield, Illinois.    In December 1848,Philo H. ThompsonwroteLincoln urging him to help King.  From December 1848 to February 1849, Lincoln received\n                  several letters urging him to help King secure a position.  On April 7, 1849, Lincoln\n                  wrote aletterto Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewingrecommending King for the job of register.    On April 13, he wrote anotherletterreversing himself, recommending King for the job of receiver.On April 25, LincolnwroteThompson that a “tirade” has erupted over his support for King.Whigsin Springfield were upset that Lincoln had endorsed King, who was fromTazewell County, for a plum patronage job instead of someone fromSangamon County.  Hoping to scuttle King’s appointment, opponents cast aspersions on King’s moral\n                  rectitude.  Lincoln bemoaned that his influence inWashingtonhad broken down and that King’s prospects for a job had diminished.  Lincoln urged\n                  Thompson to find out the truth about King, and, if the charges proved false, to take\n                  measures to sustain his endorsement of King.  In the meantime, LincolnwroteSecretary Ewing  attempting to head off any charges against King or his other recommendations\n                  for jobs in theDepartment of the Interior.Acting on Lincoln’s request,  Thompson crafted a petition denying the allegations\n                  leveled against King and secured the signatures of prominent Whigs andDemocratsin Tazewell County.  He enclosed the signedpetitionin aletterwritten on May 3.  Between April 30 and May 7, Mark,Samuel R. Baker,Edward Jones,  andJohn W. Caseywrote Lincoln attesting to King’s moral character and his fitness for public office.\n                  Lincoln penned anotherletterto Ewing on May 10, again recommending King for the job of register. Lincoln enclosed\n                  these letters, Thompson’sletter, and the signedpetitionin hisletterto Ewing, urging Ewing to pay particular attention to Mark’s missive.  In late May,\n                  King received the appointment as register  and held the job until 1853.William B. Doolittle to Abraham Lincoln;Robert W. Briggs to Abraham Lincoln;Richard T.
