For the period\n                  of July  1, 1844 to June 30, 1845, the Auburn post office had net proceeds of $40.78,\n                  with Wadsworth receiving $41.70 in compensation. The net proceeds of Wadsworth’s office\n                  from July 1, 1846 to June 30, 1847, was $32.11, with Wadsworth receiving $27.55.On February 15, 1848, Lincoln, in the House of Representatives, presented Wadsworth’s\n                  petition for more compensation, which the House tabled.  Meanwhile, the House had\n                  already adopted aresolutioncalling on the Committee of the Post Office and Post Roads to investigate the expediency\n                  of increasing the compensation for postmasters of small post offices.  On February\n                  28, 1848, RepresentativeTimothy Jenkinsintroduced abillto regulate compensation for postmasters, which the House referred to the Committee\n                  on the Post Office and Post Roads.  This bill died in committee, but theSenatepassed a similarbillon February 18, which the House and Senate, after wrangling over amendments, approved\n                  in May.  Theactbecame law on May 17.The net proceeds of Wadsworth’s office from July 1, 1848 to June 30, 1849, was $48.92,\n                  with Wadsworth receiving $49.68.Cong.
