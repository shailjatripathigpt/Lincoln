I am, indeed, apprehensive, that the few who have attended, have done so, more to\n\nspare me of mortification, than in the hope of being interested in any thing I may\n\nbe able to say. This circumstance casts a damp upon my spirits, which I am sure I\n\nshall be unable to overcome during the evening. But enough of preface.2 The subject heretofore, and now to be discussed, is theSub-Treasuryscheme of the present Administration, as a means of collecting, safe-keeping, transferring\n\nand disbursing the revenues of the Nation, as contrasted with aNational Bankfor the same purposes. Mr.Douglasshas said that we (theWhigs,) have not dared to meet them (theLocos,) in argument on this question. I protest against this assertion. I assert that\n\nwe have again and again, during this discussion, urged facts and arguments against\n\nthe Sub-Treasury, which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to answer.\n\nBut lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid the question, I now\n\npropose, in my humble way, to urge those arguments again; at the same time, begging\n\nthe audience to mark well the positions I shall take, and the proof I shall offer\n\nto sustain them, and that they will not again permit Mr. Douglass or his friends,\n\nto escape the force of them, by a round and groundless assertion, that we “dare not\n\nmeet them in argument.” Of the Sub-Treasury then, as contrasted with a National Bank, for the before enumeraedp urposes, I lay down the following propositions, to wit: 1st. It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the circulating\n\nmedium. 2d. It will be a more expensive fiscal agent. 3d. It will be a less secure depository of the public money. To show the truth of the first proposition, let us take a short review of our condition\n\nunder the operation of a National Bank. It was the depository of the public revenues.\n\nBetween the collection of those revenues and the disbursements of them by the government,\n\nthe Bank was permitted to, and did actually loan them out to individuals, and hence\n\nthe large amount of money annually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other\n\nplan would have been idle a great portion of time, was kept almost constantly in circulation.\n\nAny person who will reflect, that money is only valuable while in circulation, will\n\nreadily perceive, that any device which will keep the government revenues, in constant\n\ncirculation, instead of being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage. By the Sub-Treasury, the revenue is to be collected, and kept in iron boxes until\n\nthe government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the use of it,\n\nwhile the government does not itself need it, and while the money is performing no\n\nnobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes. The natural effect of this change\n\nof policy, every one will see, is toreducethe quantity of money in circulation. But again, by the Sub-Treasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie. I\n\nanticipate that this will be disputed. I expect to hear it said, that it is not the\n\npolicy of the Administration to collect the revenue in specie. If it shall, I reply,\n\nthat Mr.Van Buren, in his message recommending the Sub-Treasury, expended nearly a column of that document\n\nin an attempt to persuadeCongressto provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes\n\nwith these words. “It may be safely assumed, that no motive ofconvenienceto thecitizen, requires the reception of Bank paper.”3In addition to this, Mr.Silas Wright, Senator fromNew York, and the political, personal and confidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and\n\nintroduced into theSenatethe first Sub-Treasury Bill, and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the\n\nrevenue in specie.4It is true, I know, that that clause was stricken from the bill, but it was done\n\nby the votes of the Whigs, aided by a portion only of the Van Buren Senators. No\n\nSub-Treasury bill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by\n\nCongress, some with and some without the specie clause;5so that I admit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the administration\n\nfavor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it, that the fact that thePresidentat first urged the specie doctrine, and that under his recommendation the first bill\n\nintroduced embraced it, warrants us in charging it as the policy of theparty, until their head as publicly recants it, as he at first espoused it—I repeat then,\n\nthat by the Sub-Treasury, the revenue is to be collected inspecie. Now mark what the effect of this must be. By all estimates ever made, there are\n\nbut between 60 and 80 millions of specie in the United States. The expenditures of\n\nthe Government for the year 1838, the last for which we have had the report, were\n\n40 millions. Thus it is seen, that if the whole revenue be collected in specie, it\n\nwill take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it. By this means,\n\nmore than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen million of souls, who compose\n\nthe whole population of the country, is thrown into the hands of the public office-holders,\n\nand other public creditors, composing in number, perhaps not more than one quarter\n\nof a million; leaving the other fourteen millions and three quarters to get along\n\nas they best can, with less than one half of the specie of the country, and whatever\n\nrags and shin-plasters they may be able to put, and keep, in circulation. By this\n\nmeans, every office holder, and other public creditor may, and most likely will, set\n\nup shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the specie men have of it; each specie\n\nman, upon a fair division, having to his share, the fleecing of about 59 rag men.—*6 ^*On the 4th of January, 1839, the Senate of the United States passed the following\n\nresolution, to wit:^ ^“Resolved, That theSecretaryof theTreasurybe directed to communicate to the Senate any information he may recently have received\n\nin respect to the mode of collecting, keeping and disbursing public monies in foreign\n\ncountries.”^ ^Under this resolution the Secretary communicated to the Senate, a letter, the following\n\nextract from which, clearly shows that the collection of the revenue inspecie, will establish a sound currency for the office holders, and a depreciated one for\n\nthe people; and that the officeholders and other public creditors will turn shavers\n\nupon the rest of the community.^ ^Here is the extract of the letter, being all of it that relates to the question.^ ^“Hague, October 12, 1838.^ ^“The financial system ofHamburgis, as far as is known, very simple, as may be supposed, from so small a territory.^ ^The whole amount of Hamburg coined money is about four and a half millions of marks\n\ncurrent, or one million two hundred and eighty-two thousand five hundred dollars;\n\nand except under very extraordinary circumstances,not more than one half that amount is in circulation, and all duties, taxes, and excise, must be paid in Hamburg currency.The consequence is that it invariably commands a premium of one to three per centum. Every year one Senator and ten citizens are appointed to transact the whole of\n\nthe financial concern, both as to receipt and disbursement of the funds,which is always in cash, and is every day deposited in the bank, to the credit of the chancery; and on being\n\npaid out the citizen to whose department the payment belongs must appear personally\n\nwith the check or order, stating the amount and to whom to be paid. The person receiving\n\nvery seldom keeps the money,preferring to dispose of it to a money changer at a premium, and taking other coin at a discount, of which there is a great variety and to large\n\namount constantly in circulation, and on which in his daily paymenthe loses nothing, and those who have payments to make to the Government apply to themoney changers again for Hamburg currency, which keeps it in constant motion; and I believe it frequently occurs that the bags\n\nwhich are sealed and labelled with the amount, are returned again to the bank without being opened.^ ^“With great respect, your obedient servant, “JOHN CUTHBERT.”^ ^“To the Hon.Levi Woodury, “Secretary of the Treasury,Washington, D.C.”^ ^This letter is found in Senate Document, page 113, of the Session of 1838-’39.^ In all candor, let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many, ever before devised? And was the sacred name\n\nof Democracy, ever before made to endorse such an enormity against the rights of the\n\npeople? I have already said that the Sub-Treasury will reduce the quantity of money in circulation.\n\nThis position is strengthened by the recollection, that the revenue is to be collected\n\nin specie, so that the mere amount of revenue is not all that is withdrawn, but the\n\namount of paper circulation that the 40 millions would serve to as a basis, is withdrawn;\n\nwhich would be in a sound state at least 100 millions.—When 100 millions, or more,\n\nof the circulation we now have, shall be withdrawn, who can contemplate, without terror,\n\nthe distress, ruin, bankruptcy and beggary, that must follow. The man who has purchased any article, say a horse, on credit, at 100 dollars, when\n\nthere are 200 millions circulating in the country, if the quantity be reduced to 100\n\nmillions by the arrival of pay-day, will find the horse but sufficient to pay half\n\nthe debt; and the other half must either be paid out of his other means, and thereby\n\nbecome a clear loss to him; or go unpaid, and thereby become a clear loss to his creditor.\n\nWhat I have here said of a single case of the purchase of a horse, will hold good\n\nin every case of a debt existing at the time a reduction in the quantity of money\n\noccurs, by whomsoever, and for whatsoever it may have been contracted. It may be\n\nsaid, that what the debtor loses, the creditor gains by this operation; but on examination\n\nthis will be found true only to a very limited extent. It is more generally true,\n\nthatalllose by it. Thecreditor, by losing more of his debts, than he gains by the increased value of those he collects;\n\nthedebtorby either parting with more of his property to pay his debts, than he received in\n\ncontracting them; or, by entirely breaking up in his business, and thereby being thrown\n\nupon the world in idleness. The general distress thus created, will, to be sure, betemporary;because whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any community,timewill adjust the derangement produced; but while that adjustment is progressing, all\n\nsuffer more or less, and very many lose every thing that renders life desirable. Why\n\nthen, shall we suffer a severe difficulty, even though it bebut temporary, unless we receive some equivalent for it? What I have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the quantity of\n\nmoney, relates to thewholecountry. I now propose to show, that it would produce apeculiarandpermanenthardship upon the citizens of those States and Territories in which the public lands\n\nlie. The Land Offices in those States and Territories, as all know, form the great\n\ngulf by which all, or nearly all the money in them, is swallowed up. When the quantity\n\nof money shall be reduced, and consequently every thing under individual control brought\n\ndown in proportion, the price of those lands, being fixed by law, will remain as now.\n\nOf necessity it will follow, that theproduceorlabor, thatnowraises money sufficient to purchase 80 acres, willthenraise but sufficient to purchase 40, or perhaps not that much. And this difficulty\n\nand hardship, will last as long, in some degree, as any portion of these lands shall\n\nremain undisposed of. Knowing, as I well do, the difficulty that poor peoplenowencounter in procuring homes, I hesitate not to say, that when the price of the public\n\nlands, shall be doubled or trepled; or, which is the same thing, produce and labor cut down to one half, or one third\n\nof their present prices, it will be little less than impossible for them to procure\n\nthose homes at all. In answer to what I have said as to the effect the Sub-Treasury would have upon the\n\ncurrency, it is often urged that the money collected for revenue purposes willnot lie idlein the vaults of the Treasury; and, farther, that a National Bank produces greater\n\nderangement in the currency, by a system of contractions and expansions, than the\n\nSub-Treasury would produce in any way. In reply, I need only show, that experience\n\nproves the contrary of both these propositions. It is an undisputed fact, that the\n\nlate Bank of the United States, paid the Government $75,000 annually, for theprivilegeof using the public money between the times of its collection and disbursement.\n\nCan any man suppose, that the Bank would have paid this sum, annually for twenty years,\n\nand then offered to renew its obligations to do so, if in reality there was notimeintervening between the collection and disbursement of the revenue, and consequently\n\nno privilege ofusingthe money extended to it? Again, as to the contractions and expansions of a National Bank, I need only point\n\nto the period intervening between the time that the late Bank got into successful\n\noperation and that at which the Government commenced war upon it, to show that during\n\nthat period, no such contractions or expansions took place. If before, or after that\n\nperiod, derangement occurred in the currency, it proves nothing. The Bank could not\n\nbe expected to regulate the currency, eitherbeforeit got into successful operation, orafterit was crippled and thrown into death convulsions, by the removal of deposites from it, and other hostile measures of the Government, against it.7We do not pretend, that a National Bank can establish and maintain a sound and uniform\n\nstate of currency in the country, inspiteof the National Government; but we do say, that it has established and maintained\n\nsuch a currency, and can do so again, by theaidof that Government; and we further say, that no duty is more imperative on that Government,\n\nthan the duty it owes the people, of furnishing them a sound and uniform currency. I now leave the proposition as to the effect of the Sub-Treasury upon the currency\n\nof the country, and pass to that relative to the additionalexpensewhich must be incurred by it over that incurred by a National Bank, as a fiscal agent\n\nof the Government. By the late National Bank, we had the public revenue received,\n\nsafely kept, transferred and disbursed, not only without expense, but we actually\n\nreceived of the Bank $75,000 annually for its privileges, while rendering us those\n\nservices. By the Sub-Treasury, according to the estimate of the Secretary of the\n\nTreasury, who is the warm advocate of the system and which estimate is the lowest\n\nmade by any one, the same services are to cost $60,000. Mr.Rives, who, to say the least, is equally talented and honest, estimates that these services,\n\nunder the Sub-Treasury system, cannot cost less than $600,000. For the sake of liberality,\n\nlet us suppose that the estimates of the Secretary and Mr. Rives, are the two extremes,\n\nand that their mean is about the true estimate, and we shall then find, that when\n\nto that sum is added the $75,000, which the Bank paid us, the difference between the\n\ntwo systems, in favor of the Bank, and against the Sub-Treasury, is $405,000 a year.\n\nThis sum, though small when compared to the many millions annually expended by the\n\nGeneral Government, is, when viewed by itself, very large; and much too large, when\n\nviewed in any light, to be thrown away once a year for nothing. It is sufficient\n\nto pay the pensions of more than 4,000 Revolutionary Soldiers, or to purchase a 40\n\nacre tract of Government land, for each one of more than 8,000 poor families. To the argument against the Sub-Treasury, on the score of additional expense, its\n\nfriends, so far as I know, attempt no answer. They choose, so far as I can learn,\n\nto treat the throwing away $405,000 once a year, as a matter entirely too small to\n\nmerit their democratic notice. I now come to the proposition, that it would be less secure than a National Bank,\n\nas a depository of the public money. The experience of the past, I think, proves\n\nthe truth of this. And here, inasmuch as I rely chiefly upon experience to establish\n\nit, let me ask, how is it that we know any thing—that any event will occur, that any\n\ncombination of circumstances will produce a certain result—except by the analogies\n\nof past experience? What has once happened, will invariably happen again, when the\n\nsame circumstances which combined to produce it, shall again combine in the same way.\n\nWe all feel that we know that a blast of wind would extinguish the flame of the candle\n\nthat stands by me. How do we know it? We have never seen this flame thus extinguished.\n\nWe know it, because we have seen through all our lives, that a blast of wind extinguishes\n\nthe flame of a candle whenever it is thrown fully upon it. Again, we all feel toknowthat we have to die.—How? We have never died yet. We know it, because we know, or\n\nat least think we know, that of all the beings, just like ourselves, who have been\n\ncoming into the world for six thousand years, not one is now living who was here two\n\nhundred years ago. I repeat then, that we know nothing of what will happen in future, but by the analogy\n\nof experience, and that the fair analogy of past experience fully proves that the\n\nSub-Treasury would be a less safe depository of the public money than a National Bank.\n\nExamine it. By the Sub-Treasury scheme, the public money is to be kept, between the\n\ntimes of its collection and disbursement, by Treasurers of the Mint, Custom-house\n\nofficers, Land officers, and some new officers to be appointed in the same way that\n\nthose first enumerated are. Has a year passed since the organization of the Government,\n\nthat numerous defalcations have not occurred among this class of officers? Look atSwartwoutwith his $1,200,000,Pricewith his $75,000,Harriswith his $109,000,Hawkinswith his $100,000,Linnwith his $55,000, together with some twenty-five hundred lesser lights. Place the\n\npublic money again in these same hands, and will it not again go the same way? Most\n\nassuredly it will. But turn to the history of the National Bank in this country,\n\nand we shall there see, that those Banks performed the fiscal operations of the Government\n\nthro’ a period of 40 years, received, safely kept, transferred, disbursed, an aggregate\n\nof nearly five hundred millions of dollars; and that, in all that time, and with all\n\nthat money, not one dollar, nor one cent, did the Government lose by them. Place\n\nthe public money again in a similar depository, and will it not again be safe? But, conclusive as the experience of fifty years is, that individuals are unsafe depositories\n\nof the public money, and of forty years that National Banks are safe depositories,\n\nwe are not left to rely solely upon that experience for the truth of those propositions.—If\n\nexperience were silent upon the subject, conclusive reasons could be shown for the\n\ntruth of them. It is often urged, that to say the public money will be more secure in a National\n\nBank, than in the hands of individuals, as proposed in the Sub-Treasury, is to say,\n\nthat Bank directors and Bank officers are more honest than sworn officers of the Government.\n\nNot so. We insist on no such thing. We say that public officers, selected with reference\n\nto their capacity and honesty, (which by the way, we deny is the practice in these\n\ndays,) stand an equal chance, precisely, of being capable and honest, with Bank officers\n\nselected by the same rule. We further say, that with however much care selections\n\nmay be made, there will be some unfaithful and dishonest in both classes. The experience\n\nof the whole world, in all by-gone times, prove this true. The Saviour of the world\n\nchose twelve disciples, and even one of that small number, selected by super-human\n\nwisdom, turned out a traitor and a devil. And, it may not be improper here to add,\n\nthatJudascarried the bag—was the Sub-Treasurer of the Saviour and his disciples. We, then, do not say, nor need we say, to maintain our proposition, that Bank officers\n\nare more honest than Government officers, selected by the same rule. What we do say,\n\nis, that theinterestof the Sub-Treasurer isagainst his duty—while theinterestof the Bank ison the side of its duty. Take instances—a Sub-Treasurer has in his hands one hundred thousand dollars of\n\npublic money; hisdutysays—“You ought to pay this money over”—but hisinterestsays, “You ought to run away with this sum, and be a nabob8the balance of your life.” And who that knows any thing of human nature, doubts that,\n\nin many instances, interest will prevail over duty, and that the Sub-Treasurer will\n\nprefer opulent knavery in a foreign land, to honest poverty at home? But how different\n\nis it with a Bank. Besides the Government money deposited with it, it is doing business\n\nupon a large capital of its own. If it proves faithful to the Government, it continues\n\nits business; if unfaithful, it forfeits its charter, breaks up its business, and\n\nthereby loses more than all it can make by seizing upon the Government funds in its\n\npossession. Itsinterest, therefore, is on the side of its duty—is to be faithful to the Government, and consequently,\n\neven the dishonest amongst its managers, have no temptation to be faithless to it.—Even\n\nif robberies happen in the Bank, the losses are borne by the Bank, and the Government\n\nloses nothing. It is for this reason then, that we say a Bank is the more secure.\n\nIt is because of that admirable feature in the Bank system, which places theinterestand thedutyof the depository both on one side; whereas that feature can never enter into the\n\nSub-Treasury system. By the latter, theinterestof the individuals keeping the public money, will wage an eternal war with theirduty, and in very many instances must be victorious. In answer to the argument drawn\n\nfrom the fact that individual depositories of public money, have always proved unsafe,\n\nit is urged that even if we had a National Bank, the money has topass throughthe same individual hands, that it will under the Sub-Treasury. This is only partially\n\ntrue in fact, and wholly fallacious in argument. It is only partially true, in fact, because by the Sub-Treasury bill, four Receivers\n\nGeneral are to be appointed by thePresidentand Senate. These are new officers, and consequently, it cannot be true that the\n\nmoney, or any portion of it, has heretofore passed thro’ their hands. These four new officers are to be located at New York,Boston,CharlestonandSt. Louis, and consequently are to be the depositories of all the money collected at or near\n\nthose points; so that more than three-fourths of the public money will fall into the\n\nkeeping of these four new officers, which did not exist as officers under the National\n\nBank system. It is only partially true, then, that the money passes through the same\n\nhands, under a National Bank, as it would do under the Sub-Treasury.9 It is true, that under either system, individuals must be employed as Collectors of\n\nthe Customs, Receivers at the Land Offices, &c. &c. but the difference is, that under the Bank system, the Receivers of all sorts, receive\n\nthe money and pay it over to the Bank once a week when the collections are large,\n\nand once a month when they are small, whereas, by the Sub-Treasury system, individuals\n\nare not only to collect the money, but they are tokeepit also, or pay it over to other individuals equally unsafe as themselves, to be\n\nby them kept, until it is wanted for disbursement. It is during the time that it\n\nis thus lying idle in their hands, that opportunity is afforded, and temptation held\n\nout to them to embezzle and escape with it. By the Bank system, each Collector or\n\nReceiver, is to desposite in Bank all the money in his hands at the end of each month at most, and to send\n\nthe Bank certificates of deposite, to the Secretary of the Treasury. Whenever that certificate of deposite fails to arrive at the proper time, the Secretaryknowsthat the officers thus failing, is acting the knave; and if he is himself disposed\n\nto do his duty, he has him immedi-<Page 6>ately removed from office, and thereby cuts him off from the possibility of embezzling\n\nbut little more than the receipts of a single month. But by the Sub-Treasury System,\n\nthe money is to lie month after month in the hands of individuals; larger amounts\n\nare to accumulate in the hands of the Receivers General, and some others, by perhaps\n\nten to one, than ever accumulated in the hands of individuals before; yet during all\n\nthis time, in relation to this great stake, the Secretary of the Treasury can comparatively\n\nknow nothing. Reports, to be sure, he will have, but reports are often false, and\n\nalways false when made by a knave to cloak his knavery. Long experience has shown,\n\nthat nothing short of an actual demand of the money will expose an adroit peculator.\n\nAsk him for reports and he will give them to your heart’s content; send agents to\n\nexamine and count the money in his hands, and he will borrow of a friend, merely to\n\nbe counted and then returned, a sufficient sum to make the sum square. Try what you\n\nwill, it will all fail till you demand the money—then, and not till then, the truth\n\nwill come. The sum of the whole matter, I take to be this: Under the Bank system, while sums\n\nof money, by the law, were permitted to lie in the hands of individuals,for very short periods only, many and very large defalcations occurred by those individuals. Under the Sub-Treasury\n\nsystem,much larger sumsare to lie in the hands of individualsfor much longer periods, thereby multiplyingtemptationin proportion as the sumsare larger; and multiplyingopportunityin proportion as the periodsare longerto, and for, those individuals to embezzle and escape with the public treasure;\n\nand, therefore, just in the proportion, that thetemptationand theopportunityare greater under the Sub-Treasury than the Bank system, will the peculations and\n\ndefalcations be greater under the former than they have been under the latter. The\n\ntruth of this, independent of actual experience, is but little less than self-evident.\n\nI therefore, leave it. But it is said, and truly too, that there is to be aPenitentiary Departmentto the Sub-Treasury. This, the advocates of the system will have it, will be a “hing-cure-all.” Before I go farther, may I not ask if thePenitentiary Department, is not itself an admission that they expect the public money to be stolen? Why\n\nbuild the cage if they expect to catch no birds? But to the question how effectual\n\nthe Pentenitiary will be in preventing defalcations. How effectual have Penitentiaries heretofore\n\nbeen in preventing the crimes they were established to suppress? Has not confinement\n\nin them long been the legal penalty of larceny, forgery, robbery, and many other crimes,\n\nin almost all the States? And yet, are not those crimes committed weekly, daily,\n\nnay, and even hourly, in every one of those States? Again, the gallows has long been\n\nthe penalty of murder, and yet we scarcely open a newspaper, that does not relate\n\na new case of that crime. If then, the Penitentiary has everheretoforefailed to prevent larceny, forgery and robbery, and the gallows and halter have likewise\n\nfailed to prevent murder, by what process of reasoning, I ask, is it that we are to\n\nconclude the Penitentiary willhereafterprevent the stealing of the public money? But our opponents seem to think they answer\n\nthe charge, that the money will be stolen, fully, if they can show that they will\n\nbring the offenders to punishment. Not so. Will the punishment of the thief bring\n\nback the stolen money? No more so than the hanging of a murderer restores his victim\n\nto life. What is the object desired?—Certainly not the greatest number of thieves\n\nwe can catch, but that the money may not be stolen. If, then, any plan can be devised\n\nfor depositing the public treasure, where it will be never stolen, never embezzled,\n\nis not that the plan to be adopted? Turn, then, to a National Bank, and you have\n\nthat plan, fully and completely successful, as tested by the experience of forty years.10 I have now done with the three propositions that the Sub-Treasury would injuriously\n\naffect the currency, and would be moreexpensiveandless secureas a depository of the public money than a National Bank. How far I have succeeded\n\nin establishing their truth, is for others to judge. Omitting, for want of time, what I had intended to say as to the effect of the Sub-Treasury,\n\nto bring the public money under the more immediate control of thePresident, than it has ever heretofore been, I now only ask the audience, when Mr.Calhounshall answer me,to hold him to the questions.11Permit him not to escape them. Require himeitherto show, that the Sub-Treasurywould notinjuriously affect thecurrency, or that we should in some way, receive an equivalent for that injurious effect.\n\nRequire himeitherto show that the Sub-Treasurywould not be more expensiveas a fiscal agent, than a Bank, or that we should, in some way, be compensated for\n\nthat additional expense. And particularly<Page 7>require him to show, that the public moneywould be as securein the Sub-Treasury as in a National Bank, or that the additionalinsecuritywould be overbalanced by some good result of the proposed change. No one of them, in my humble judgment, will he be able to do; and I venture the prediction,\n\nand ask that it may be especially noted,that he will not attempt to answer the proposition,that the Sub-Treasury would be more expensive than a National Bank,as a fiscal agent of the Government. As a sweeping objection to a National Bank, and consequently an argument in favor\n\nof the Sub-Treasury as a substitute for it, it often has been urged, and doubtless\n\nwill be again, that such a Bank is unconstitutional. We have often heretofore shown,\n\nand therefore, need not in detail, do so again, that a majority of the Revolutionary\n\npatriarchs, whoever acted officially upon the question, commencing with Gen.Washington, and embracingGen. Jackson, the larger number of the signers of the Declaration, and of the framers of the Constitution,\n\nwho were in the Congress of 1791, have decided upon their oaths that such a Bank is\n\nconstitutional. We have also shown that the votes of Congress, have more often been\n\nin favor of, that against its constitutionality. In addition to all this, we have\n\nshown that theSupreme Court—that tribunal which the Constitution has itself established to decide Constitutional\n\nquestions—has solemnly decided that such a Bank is constitutional.12Protesting that these authorities ought to settle the question—ought to be conclusive,\n\nI will not urge them further now. I now propose to take a view of the question, which\n\nI have not known to be taken by any one before. It is, that whatever objection ever\n\nhas, or ever can be made to the constitutionality of a Bank, will apply with equal\n\nforce in its whole length, breadth and proportions, to the Sub-Treasury. Our opponents\n\nsay, there is noexpressauthority in the Constitution to establish aBank, and therefore a Bank is unconstitutional; but we, with equal truth, may say, there\n\nis noexpressauthority in the Constitution to establish aSub-Treasury, and therefore a Sub-Treasury is unconstitutional. Who then, has the advantage of\n\nthis “express authority” argument? Does it not cut equally both ways? Does it not wound them as deeply and\n\nas deadly as it does us? Our position is that both are constitutional. The Constitution enumerates expressly\n\nseveral powers which Congress may exercise, superadded to which is a general authority,\n\n“to make all laws necessary and proper,” for carrying into effect all the powers vested by the Constitution of the Government\n\nof the United States.13One of the express powers given Congress, is “To lay and collect taxes; duties, imposts, and excises; to pay the debts, and provide\n\nfor the common defence and general welfare of the United States.14”—Now, Congress is expressly authorised to make all laws necessary and proper for\n\ncarrying this power into execution. To carry it into execution, it is indispensably\n\nnecessary to collect, safely keep, transfer, and disburse a revenue. To do this,\n\na Bank is “necessary and proper.” But, say our opponents, to authorize the making\n\nof a Bank, thenecessitymust be so great, that the power just recited, would be nugatory without it; and\n\nthat thatnecessityis expressly negatived by the fact, that they have got alongtenwhole years without such aBank. Immediately we turn on them, and say, that that sort ofnecessityfor aSub-Treasurydoes not exist, because we have got alongfortywhole years without one. And this time, it may be observed, that we are not merely\n\nequal with them in the argument, but we beat themfortytoten, or which is the same thing,fourtoone. On examination, it will be found, that the absurd rule, which prescribes that before\n\nwe can constitutionally adopt a National Bank as a fiscal agent, we must show anindispensable necessityfor it, will exclude every sort of fiscal agent that the mind of man can conceive.\n\nABankis notindispensable, because we can take theSub-Treasury; theSub-Treasuryis notindispensablebecause we can take theBank. The rule is too absurd to need further comment. Upon the phrase “necessary and proper,” in the Constitution, it seems to me more reasonable to say, thatsomefiscal agent isindispensably necessary; but, inasmuch as noparticular sortof agent is thusindispensable, because someothersort might be adopted, we are left to choose that sort of agent, which may be most\n\n“proper” on grounds of expediency. But it is said the Constitution gives no power to Congress to pass acts of incorporation.\n\nIndeed! What is the passing an act of incorporation, but themaking of a law? Is any one wise enough to tell? The Constitution expressly gives Congress power\n\n“to pass all laws necessary and proper,” &c. If, then, the passing of a Bank charter, be the “making<Page 8>a law necessary and proper,” is it not clearly within the constitutional power of Congress to do so? I now leave the Bank and the Sub-Treasury to try to answer, in a brief way, some of\n\nthe arguments which, on previous evenings here, have been urged by Messrs.Lambornand Douglass. Mr. Lamborn admits, that “errors,” as he charitably calls them, have occurred under the present and late administrations;\n\nbut he insists that as great “errors” have occurred under all administrations. This, we respectfully deny. We admit that\n\nerrors may have occurred under all administrations; but we insist that there isno parallelbetween them and those of the two last. If they can show that their errors are no\n\ngreater in number and magnitude, than those of former times, we call off the dogs. But they can do no such thing. To be brief, I will now attempt a contrast of the\n\n“errors” of the two latter, with those of former administrations, in relation to the\n\npublic expenditures only. What I am now about to say, as to the expenditures, will\n\nbe, in all cases, exclusive of payments on the National debt. By an examination of\n\nauthentic public documents, consisting of the regular series of annual reports, made\n\nby all the Secretaries of the Treasury from the establishment of the Government down\n\nto the close of the year 1838, the following contrasts will be presented. 1st. The lasttenyears under Gen. Jackson and Mr. Van Buren, cost more money than the firsttwenty-sevendid, (including the heavy expenses of thelate British war,) under Washington, Adams,JeffersonandMadison. 2d. The last year ofJ. Q. Adams’ administration cost, in round numbers,thirteenmillions, being aboutonedollar to each soul in the nation; the last (1838) of Mr. Van Buren’s costfortymillions, being abouttwo dollars and fifty centsto each soul; and being larger than the expenditure of Mr. Adams in the proportion\n\noffivetotwo. 3d. The highest annual expenditure during the late British war, being in 1814. and\n\nwhile we had in actual service rising 188,000 militia, together with the whole regular\n\narmy, swelling the number to greatly ever 200,000, and they to be clad, fed and transported from point to point, with great\n\nrapidity and corresponding expense, and to be furnished with arms and ammunition,\n\nand they to be transported in like manner, and at like expense, was no more in round\n\nnumbers thanthirtymillions; whereas, the annual expenditure of 1838, under Mr. Van Buren, and while\n\nwe were at peace with every government in the world, wasfortymillions; being over the highest year of the late and very expensive war, in the\n\nproportion offourtothree. 4th. Gen. Washington administered the Governmenteightyears forsixteenmillions; Mr. Van Buren administered itoneyear (1838) forfortymillions; so that Mr. Van Buren expendedtwice and a halfas much inoneyear, as Gen. Washington did ineight, and being in the proportion oftwentytoone—or, in other words, had Gen. Washington administered the Governmenttwentyyears, at the same average expense he did foreight, he would have carried us through the wholetwenty,for no more money than Mr. Van Buren has expended in getting us through the singleoneof 1838. Other facts, equally astounding, might be presented from the same authentic document:\n\nbut I deem the foregoing abundantly sufficient to establish the proposition, that\n\nthere is no parallel between the “errors” of the present and late administrations, and those of former times, and that Mr.\n\nVan Buren is wholly out of the line of all precedents. But, Mr. Douglass, seeing that the enormous expenditure of 1838, has no parallel in\n\nthe olden times, comes in with a long list of excuses for it. This list of excuses,\n\nI will rapidly examine, and show, as I think, that the few of them which are true,\n\nprove nothing; and that the majority of them are wholly untrue in fact. He first\n\nsays, that the expenditures of that year were made under the appropriations of Congress—one branch of which was a Whig body. It is true that those expenditures were made under the appropriations of Congress;\n\nbut it isuntruethat either branch of Congress was aWhigbody. The Senate had fallen into the hands of the administration, more than a year\n\nbefore, as proven by the passage of the Expunging Resolution;15and at the time those appropriations were made, there were too few Whigs in that\n\nbody, to make a respectable struggle, in point of numbers, upon any question.—This\n\nis notorious to all. TheHouse of Representativesthat voted those appropriations, was the same that first assembled at the called\n\nsession of September, 1838. Although it refused to pass the Sub-Treasury Bill, a majority of its members were\n\nelected as friends of the administration, and proved their adherance to it, by the election of a Van Buren Speaker, and two Van Buren clerks.16It is clear then, that both branches of the Congress that passed those appropriations\n\nwere in the hands of Mr. Van Buren’s friends, so that the Whigs had no power to arrest\n\nthem, as Mr. Douglass would insist. And is not the charge of extravagant expenditures,\n\nequally well sustained, if shown to have been made by a Van Buren Congress, as if\n\nshown to have been made in any other way? A Van Buren Congress passed the bill; and\n\nMr. Van Buren himself approved them, and consequently the party are wholly responsible\n\nfor them. Mr. Douglass next says, that a portion of the expenditures of that year, was made\n\nfor the purchase of Public Lands from the Indians. Now it happens that no such purchase\n\nwas made during that year. It is true, that some money was paid that year in pursuance\n\nof Indian treaties; but no more, or rather not as much, as had been paid on the same\n\naccount in each of several preceding years. Next, he says, that theFlorlda warcreated many millions of this year’s expenditure. This is true, and it is also true,\n\nthat during that and every other year, that that war has existed, it has cost three\n\nor four times as much as it would have done under an honest and judicious administration\n\nof the Government. The large sums, foolishly, not to say corruptly thrown away in\n\nthat war, constitute one of the just causes of complaint against the administration.\n\nTake a single instance. The agents of the Government in connexion with that war, needed a certain Steam boat; the owner proposed to sell it for ten\n\nthousand dollars; the agents refused to give that sum, but hired the boat at one hundred\n\ndollars per day, and keep it at that hire till it amounted to ninety-two thousand dollars. This fact is not found in the public\n\nreports, but depends with me, on the verbal statement of an officer of thenavy, who says he knows it to be true. That the administration ought to be credited for thereasonableexpenses of the Florida war, we have never denied. Thosereasonablecharges, we say, could not exceed one or two millions a year. Deduct such a sum\n\nfrom the forty miliion expenditure of 1838, and the remainder will still be without a parallel as an annual\n\nexpenditure. Again, Mr. Douglass says, that theremoval of the Indiansto the country west of the Mississippi, created much of the expenditure of 1838.\n\nI have examined the public documents in relation to this matter, and find that less\n\nwas paid for the removal of Indians in that, than in some former years. The whole\n\nsum expended on that account in that year, did not much exceed one quarter of a million.\n\nFor this small sum, altho’ we do not think the administration entitled to credit,\n\nbecause large sums have been expended in the same way in former years, we consent\n\nit may take one and make the most of it. Next, Mr. Douglass says, that five millions of the expenditures of 1838, consisted\n\nof the payment of theFrench indemnity money to its individual claimants. I have carefully examined the public documents, and thereby find this statement\n\nto be wholly untrue. Of the forty millions of dollars expended in 1838, I am enabled\n\nto say positively, that not one dollar consisted of payments on the French Indemnities.\n\nSo much for that excuse. Next comes thePost Office.—He says that five millions were expended during that year to sustain that Department.\n\nBy a like examination of public documents, I find this also, wholly untrue. Of the\n\nso often mentioned forty millions, not one dollar went to the Post Office. I am glad,\n\nhowever, that the Post Offie has been referred to, because it warrants me in digressing a little, to enquire how\n\nit is, that that department of the Government has, become achargeupon the Treasury, whereas under Mr. Adams and the Presidents before him, it not\n\nonly, to use a homely phrase, cut its own fodder, but actually threw a surplus into\n\nthe Treasury.—Although nothing of the forty millions was paid on that account, in\n\n1838; it is true that five millions are appropriatedto be so expendedin 1839; showing clearly that the department has become achargeupon the Treasury.—How has this happened? I account for it in this way—The chief expense of the Post Office Department consists\n\nof the payments of Contractors for carrying the mail—Contracts for carrying the mails,\n\nare, by law, let to the lowest bidders, after advertisement. This plan introduces\n\ncompetition, and insures the transportation of the mails at fair prices, so long as\n\nit is faithfully adhered to. It hasever been adhered to until Mr.Barrywas made Post Master General. When he came into office he formed the purpose of\n\nthrowing the mail contracts into the hands, of his friends to the exclusion of his\n\nopponents. To effect this, the plan of letting to the lowest bidder, must be evaded,\n\nand it must be done in this way—The favorite bid less by perhaps three or four hundred\n\nper cent. than the contract could be performed for, and consequently shutting out all honest\n\ncompetition, became the<Page 9>contractor. The Post Master General would immediately add some slight additional\n\nduty to the contract, and under the pretence of extra allowance for extra services,\n\nrun the contract to double, triple, and often quadruple, what honest and fair bidders\n\nhad proposed to take it at. In 1834 the finances of the department had become so\n\nderanged, that total concealment was no longer possible, and consequently a committee\n\nof the Senate were directed to make a thorough investigation of its affairs. Their\n\nreport is found in the Senate Documents of 1033-’34—Vol. 5, Doc. 422—which Documents\n\nmay be seen at the Secretary’s Office, and I presume elsewhere in the State. The\n\nreport shows numerous cases, of similar import, of one of which I give the substance—The\n\ncontract for carrying the mail upon a certain route, had expired, and of course was\n\nto be let again. The old contractor offered to take it for $300 a year, the mail\n\nto be transported thereon three times a week, or for $600 transported daily. OneJames Reeside, bid $40 for three times a week, or $99 daily, and of course received the contract.\n\nOn the examination of the committee, it was discovered that Reeside had received for\n\nthe service on this route, which he had contracted to render for less than $100, the\n\nenormous sum of $1,999! This is but a single case. Many similar ones, covering some\n\nten or twenty pages of a large volume, are given in that report. The Department was\n\nfound to be insolvent to the amount of half a million; and to have been so grossly\n\nmismanaged, or rather so corruptly managed, in almost every particular, that the best\n\nfriends of the Post Master General made no defence of his administration of it. They\n\nadmitted that he was wholly unqualified for that office; but still he was retained\n\nin it by thePresident, until he resigned it voluntarily about a year afterwards. And when he resigned\n\nit what do you think became of him? Why, he sunk into obscurity and disgrace, to be\n\nsure, you will say. No such thing. Well, then, what did become of him? Why thePresidentimmediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost unequalled incapacity and corruption, by appointing him to a foreign mission, with a salary\n\nand outfit of $18,000 a year.—The party now attempt to throw Barry off, and to avoid\n\nthe responsibility of his sins.—Did not thePresidentendorse those sins, when on the very heel of their commission, he appointed their\n\nauthor to the very highest and most honorable office in his gift, and which is but\n\na single step behind the verygoalof American political ambition?17 I return to another of Mr. Douglass’ excuses for the expenditures of 1838, at the\n\nsame time announcing the pleasing intelligence, that this is the last one. He says\n\nthat ten millions of that years expenditure, was a contingent appropriation, to prosecute\n\nan anticipated war withGreat Britain, on theMaineboundary question. Few words will settle this. First: that the ten millions appropriated\n\nwas notmadetill 1839, and consequently could not have been expended in 1838; and, second: although\n\nit was appropriated, it has never been expended at all. Those who heard Mr. Douglass,\n\nrecollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me. “Now\n\nhe’s got me,” thought I.—But when he went on to say that five millions of the expenditure\n\nof 1838, were payments of the French indemnities,which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had been for the Post Office,which I knew to be untrue;that ten millions had been for the Maine boundary war,which I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough to hope, that I would permit such groundless\n\nand audacious assertions to go unexposed. I readily consented, that on the score\n\nboth of veracity and sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the\n\nmore deserving of the world’s contempt.18 Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party, and the Whigs\n\nis, that although the former sometimes err inpractice, they are always correct inprinciple—whereas the latter are wrong inprinciple—and the better to impress this proposition, he uses a figurative expression in these\n\nwords: “TheDemocratsare vulnerable in the heel, but they are sound in the head and the heart.” The first branch of the figure, that is that the Democrats are vulnerable in the\n\nheel, I admit is not merely figuratively, but literally true. Who that looks but\n\nfor a moment, at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their hundreds\n\nof others, scampering away with the public money toTexas, toEurope, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice,\n\ncan at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in theirheelswith a species of “running itch.” It seems that this malady of their heels, operates on thesesound-headedandhonest-heartedcreatures, very much like the cork-leg, in the comic song, did on its owner; which,\n\nwhen he had once got started on it, the more he tried to stop it, the more it would\n\nrun away.19At the hazard of wearing this point thread bare, I will relate an anecdote, which\n\nseems too strikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier, who was always\n\nboasting of his bravery, when no danger was near, but who invariably retreated without\n\norders at the first charge of an engagement, being asked by his Captain why he did\n\nso, replied: “Captain, I have as brave aheartasJulius Cæsarever had; but some how or other, whenever danger approaches, mycowardlylegs will run away with it.” So with Mr. Lamborn’s party. They take the public moneyintotheir hand for the most laudable purpose, thatwise headsandhonest heartscan dictate; but before they can possibly get itoutagain, their rascally “vulnerable heels” will run away with them. Seriously: this proposition of Mr. Lamborn is nothing more or less, than a request\n\nthat his party may be tried by theirprofessionsinstead of theirpractices. Perhaps no position that the party assumes is more liable to, or more deserving\n\nof exposure, than this very modest request; and nothing but the unwarrantable length,\n\nto which I have already extended these remarks, forbids me now attempting to expose\n\nit. For the reason given, I pass it by. I shall advert to but one more point. Mr. Lamborn refers to the late elections in the States, and from their results, confidently\n\npredicts, that every State in the Union will vote for Mr. Van Buren at thenext Presidential election. Addressthatargument tocowardsand toknaves; with thefreeand thebraveit will effect nothing. Itmaybe true, if itmust, let it. Many free countries have lost their liberty; andours maylose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was thelastto desert, but that Ineverdeserted her. I know that the great volcano atWashington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that reigns there, is belching forth the\n\nlava of political corruption, in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping with\n\nfrightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to\n\nleave unscathed no green spot or living thing, while on its bosom are riding like\n\ndemons on the waves of Hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and fiendishly taunting\n\nall those who dare resist its destroying course, with the hopelessness of their effort;\n\nand knowing this, I cannot deny that all may be swept away. Broken by it, I too,\n\nmay be; bow to it, I never will. Theprobabilitythat we may fall in the struggleought notto deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; itshall notdeter me. If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those dimensions\n\nnot wholly unworthy of its Almighty Architect, it is when I contemplate the cause\n\nof my country, deserted by all the world beside, and I standing up boldly and alone,\n\nand hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors. Here, without contemplating consequences,\n\nbefore High Heaven, and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to the\n\njust cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty and my love. And who,\n\nthat thinks with me, will not fearlessly adopt the oath that I take. Let none faulter, who thinks he is right, and we may succeed. But, if after all, we shall fail, be\n\nit so—We still shall have the proud consolation of saying to our consciences, and\n\nto the departed shade of our country’s freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment,\n\nand adored of our hearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death, weneverfaultered in defending.",

      "be able to say. This circumstance casts a damp upon my spirits, which I am sure I",
      "shall be unable to overcome during the evening. But enough of preface.2 The subject heretofore, and now to be discussed, is theSub-Treasuryscheme of the present Administration, as a means of collecting, safe-keeping, transferring",
      "and disbursing the revenues of the Nation, as contrasted with aNational Bankfor the same purposes. Mr.Douglasshas said that we (theWhigs,) have not dared to meet them (theLocos,) in argument on this question. I protest against this assertion. I assert that",
      "we have again and again, during this discussion, urged facts and arguments against",
      "the Sub-Treasury, which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to answer.",
      "But lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid the question, I now",
      "propose, in my humble way, to urge those arguments again; at the same time, begging",
      "the audience to mark well the positions I shall take, and the proof I shall offer",
      "to sustain them, and that they will not again permit Mr. Douglass or his friends,",
      "to escape the force of them, by a round and groundless assertion, that we “dare not",
      "meet them in argument.” Of the Sub-Treasury then, as contrasted with a National Bank, for the before enumeraedp urposes, I lay down the following propositions, to wit: 1st. It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the circulating",
      "medium. 2d. It will be a more expensive fiscal agent. 3d. It will be a less secure depository of the public money. To show the truth of the first proposition, let us take a short review of our condition",
      "under the operation of a National Bank. It was the depository of the public revenues.",
      "Between the collection of those revenues and the disbursements of them by the government,",
      "the Bank was permitted to, and did actually loan them out to individuals, and hence",
      "the large amount of money annually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other",
      "plan would have been idle a great portion of time, was kept almost constantly in circulation.",
      "Any person who will reflect, that money is only valuable while in circulation, will",
      "readily perceive, that any device which will keep the government revenues, in constant",
      "circulation, instead of being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage. By the Sub-Treasury, the revenue is to be collected, and kept in iron boxes until",
      "the government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the use of it,",
      "while the government does not itself need it, and while the money is performing no",
      "nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes. The natural effect of this change",
      "of policy, every one will see, is toreducethe quantity of money in circulation. But again, by the Sub-Treasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie. I",
      "anticipate that this will be disputed. I expect to hear it said, that it is not the",
      "policy of the Administration to collect the revenue in specie. If it shall, I reply,",
      "that Mr.Van Buren, in his message recommending the Sub-Treasury, expended nearly a column of that document",
      "in an attempt to persuadeCongressto provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes",
      "with these words. “It may be safely assumed, that no motive ofconvenienceto thecitizen, requires the reception of Bank paper.”3In addition to this, Mr.Silas Wright, Senator fromNew York, and the political, personal and confidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and",
      "introduced into theSenatethe first Sub-Treasury Bill, and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the",
      "revenue in specie.4It is true, I know, that that clause was stricken from the bill, but it was done",
      "by the votes of the Whigs, aided by a portion only of the Van Buren Senators. No",
      "Sub-Treasury bill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by",
      "Congress, some with and some without the specie clause;5so that I admit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the administration",
      "favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it, that the fact that thePresidentat first urged the specie doctrine, and that under his recommendation the first bill",
      "introduced embraced it, warrants us in charging it as the policy of theparty, until their head as publicly recants it, as he at first espoused it—I repeat then,",
      "that by the Sub-Treasury, the revenue is to be collected inspecie. Now mark what the effect of this must be. By all estimates ever made, there are",
      "but between 60 and 80 millions of specie in the United States. The expenditures of",
      "the Government for the year 1838, the last for which we have had the report, were",
      "40 millions. Thus it is seen, that if the whole revenue be collected in specie, it",
      "will take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it. By this means,",
      "more than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen million of souls, who compose",
      "the whole population of the country, is thrown into the hands of the public office-holders,",
      "and other public creditors, composing in number, perhaps not more than one quarter",

      "current, or one million two hundred and eighty-two thousand five hundred dollars;",
      "and except under very extraordinary circumstances,not more than one half that amount is in circulation, and all duties, taxes, and excise, must be paid in Hamburg currency.The consequence is that it invariably commands a premium of one to three per centum. Every year one Senator and ten citizens are appointed to transact the whole of",
      "the financial concern, both as to receipt and disbursement of the funds,which is always in cash, and is every day deposited in the bank, to the credit of the chancery; and on being",
      "paid out the citizen to whose department the payment belongs must appear personally",
      "with the check or order, stating the amount and to whom to be paid. The person receiving",
      "very seldom keeps the money,preferring to dispose of it to a money changer at a premium, and taking other coin at a discount, of which there is a great variety and to large",
      "amount constantly in circulation, and on which in his daily paymenthe loses nothing, and those who have payments to make to the Government apply to themoney changers again for Hamburg currency, which keeps it in constant motion; and I believe it frequently occurs that the bags",
      "which are sealed and labelled with the amount, are returned again to the bank without being opened.^ ^“With great respect, your obedient servant, “JOHN CUTHBERT.”^ ^“To the Hon.Levi Woodury, “Secretary of the Treasury,Washington, D.C.”^ ^This letter is found in Senate Document, page 113, of the Session of 1838-’39.^ In all candor, let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many, ever before devised? And was the sacred name",
      "of Democracy, ever before made to endorse such an enormity against the rights of the",
      "people? I have already said that the Sub-Treasury will reduce the quantity of money in circulation.",
      "This position is strengthened by the recollection, that the revenue is to be collected",
      "in specie, so that the mere amount of revenue is not all that is withdrawn, but the",
      "amount of paper circulation that the 40 millions would serve to as a basis, is withdrawn;",
      "which would be in a sound state at least 100 millions.—When 100 millions, or more,",
      "of the circulation we now have, shall be withdrawn, who can contemplate, without terror,",
      "the distress, ruin, bankruptcy and beggary, that must follow. The man who has purchased any article, say a horse, on credit, at 100 dollars, when",
      "there are 200 millions circulating in the country, if the quantity be reduced to 100",
      "millions by the arrival of pay-day, will find the horse but sufficient to pay half",
      "the debt; and the other half must either be paid out of his other means, and thereby",
      "become a clear loss to him; or go unpaid, and thereby become a clear loss to his creditor.",
      "What I have here said of a single case of the purchase of a horse, will hold good",
      "in every case of a debt existing at the time a reduction in the quantity of money",
      "occurs, by whomsoever, and for whatsoever it may have been contracted. It may be",
      "said, that what the debtor loses, the creditor gains by this operation; but on examination",
      "this will be found true only to a very limited extent. It is more generally true,",
      "thatalllose by it. Thecreditor, by losing more of his debts, than he gains by the increased value of those he collects;",
      "thedebtorby either parting with more of his property to pay his debts, than he received in",
      "contracting them; or, by entirely breaking up in his business, and thereby being thrown",
      "upon the world in idleness. The general distress thus created, will, to be sure, betemporary;because whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any community,timewill adjust the derangement produced; but while that adjustment is progressing, all",
      "suffer more or less, and very many lose every thing that renders life desirable. Why",
      "then, shall we suffer a severe difficulty, even though it bebut temporary, unless we receive some equivalent for it? What I have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the quantity of",
      "money, relates to thewholecountry. I now propose to show, that it would produce apeculiarandpermanenthardship upon the citizens of those States and Territories in which the public lands",
      "lie. The Land Offices in those States and Territories, as all know, form the great",
      "gulf by which all, or nearly all the money in them, is swallowed up. When the quantity",
      "of money shall be reduced, and consequently every thing under individual control brought",
      "down in proportion, the price of those lands, being fixed by law, will remain as now.",
      "Of necessity it will follow, that theproduceorlabor, thatnowraises money sufficient to purchase 80 acres, willthenraise but sufficient to purchase 40, or perhaps not that much. And this difficulty",
      "and hardship, will last as long, in some degree, as any portion of these lands shall",
      "remain undisposed of. Knowing, as I well do, the difficulty that poor peoplenowencounter in procuring homes, I hesitate not to say, that when the price of the public",
      "lands, shall be doubled or trepled; or, which is the same thing, produce and labor cut down to one half, or one third",
      "of their present prices, it will be little less than impossible for them to procure",
      "those homes at all. In answer to what I have said as to the effect the Sub-Treasury would have upon the",
      "currency, it is often urged that the money collected for revenue purposes willnot lie idlein the vaults of the Treasury; and, farther, that a National Bank produces greater",
      "derangement in the currency, by a system of contractions and expansions, than the",
      "Sub-Treasury would produce in any way. In reply, I need only show, that experience",
      "proves the contrary of both these propositions. It is an undisputed fact, that the",
      "late Bank of the United States, paid the Government $75,000 annually, for theprivilegeof using the public money between the times of its collection and disbursement.",
      "Can any man suppose, that the Bank would have paid this sum, annually for twenty years,",
      "and then offered to renew its obligations to do so, if in reality there was notimeintervening between the collection and disbursement of the revenue, and consequently",
      "no privilege ofusingthe money extended to it? Again, as to the contractions and expansions of a National Bank, I need only point",
      "to the period intervening between the time that the late Bank got into successful",
      "operation and that at which the Government commenced war upon it, to show that during",
      "that period, no such contractions or expansions took place. If before, or after that",
      "period, derangement occurred in the currency, it proves nothing. The Bank could not",
      "be expected to regulate the currency, eitherbeforeit got into successful operation, orafterit was crippled and thrown into death convulsions, by the removal of deposites from it, and other hostile measures of the Government, against it.7We do not pretend, that a National Bank can establish and maintain a sound and uniform",
      "state of currency in the country, inspiteof the National Government; but we do say, that it has established and maintained",
      "such a currency, and can do so again, by theaidof that Government; and we further say, that no duty is more imperative on that Government,",
      "than the duty it owes the people, of furnishing them a sound and uniform currency. I now leave the proposition as to the effect of the Sub-Treasury upon the currency",
      "of the country, and pass to that relative to the additionalexpensewhich must be incurred by it over that incurred by a National Bank, as a fiscal agent",
      "of the Government. By the late National Bank, we had the public revenue received,",
      "safely kept, transferred and disbursed, not only without expense, but we actually",
      "received of the Bank $75,000 annually for its privileges, while rendering us those",
      "services. By the Sub-Treasury, according to the estimate of the Secretary of the",
      "Treasury, who is the warm advocate of the system and which estimate is the lowest",
      "made by any one, the same services are to cost $60,000. Mr.Rives, who, to say the least, is equally talented and honest, estimates that these services,",
      "under the Sub-Treasury system, cannot cost less than $600,000. For the sake of liberality,",
      "let us suppose that the estimates of the Secretary and Mr. Rives, are the two extremes,",
      "and that their mean is about the true estimate, and we shall then find, that when",
      "to that sum is added the $75,000, which the Bank paid us, the difference between the",
      "two systems, in favor of the Bank, and against the Sub-Treasury, is $405,000 a year.",
      "This sum, though small when compared to the many millions annually expended by the",
      "General Government, is, when viewed by itself, very large; and much too large, when",
      "viewed in any light, to be thrown away once a year for nothing. It is sufficient",
      "to pay the pensions of more than 4,000 Revolutionary Soldiers, or to purchase a 40",
      "acre tract of Government land, for each one of more than 8,000 poor families. To the argument against the Sub-Treasury, on the score of additional expense, its",
      "friends, so far as I know, attempt no answer. They choose, so far as I can learn,",
      "to treat the throwing away $405,000 once a year, as a matter entirely too small to",
      "merit their democratic notice. I now come to the proposition, that it would be less secure than a National Bank,",
      "as a depository of the public money. The experience of the past, I think, proves",
      "the truth of this. And here, inasmuch as I rely chiefly upon experience to establish",
      "it, let me ask, how is it that we know any thing—that any event will occur, that any",
      "combination of circumstances will produce a certain result—except by the analogies",
      "of past experience? What has once happened, will invariably happen again, when the",
      "same circumstances which combined to produce it, shall again combine in the same way.",
      "We all feel that we know that a blast of wind would extinguish the flame of the candle",
      "that stands by me. How do we know it? We have never seen this flame thus extinguished.",
      "We know it, because we have seen through all our lives, that a blast of wind extinguishes",
      "the flame of a candle whenever it is thrown fully upon it. Again, we all feel toknowthat we have to die.—How? We have never died yet. We know it, because we know, or",
      "at least think we know, that of all the beings, just like ourselves, who have been",
      "coming into the world for six thousand years, not one is now living who was here two",
      "hundred years ago. I repeat then, that we know nothing of what will happen in future, but by the analogy",
      "of experience, and that the fair analogy of past experience fully proves that the",
      "Sub-Treasury would be a less safe depository of the public money than a National Bank.",
      "Examine it. By the Sub-Treasury scheme, the public money is to be kept, between the",
      "times of its collection and disbursement, by Treasurers of the Mint, Custom-house",
      "officers, Land officers, and some new officers to be appointed in the same way that",
      "those first enumerated are. Has a year passed since the organization of the Government,",
      "that numerous defalcations have not occurred among this class of officers? Look atSwartwoutwith his $1,200,000,Pricewith his $75,000,Harriswith his $109,000,Hawkinswith his $100,000,Linnwith his $55,000, together with some twenty-five hundred lesser lights. Place the",
      "public money again in these same hands, and will it not again go the same way? Most",
      "assuredly it will. But turn to the history of the National Bank in this country,",
      "and we shall there see, that those Banks performed the fiscal operations of the Government",
      "thro’ a period of 40 years, received, safely kept, transferred, disbursed, an aggregate",
      "of nearly five hundred millions of dollars; and that, in all that time, and with all",
      "that money, not one dollar, nor one cent, did the Government lose by them. Place",
      "the public money again in a similar depository, and will it not again be safe? But, conclusive as the experience of fifty years is, that individuals are unsafe depositories",
      "of the public money, and of forty years that National Banks are safe depositories,",
      "we are not left to rely solely upon that experience for the truth of those propositions.—If",
      "experience were silent upon the subject, conclusive reasons could be shown for the",
      "truth of them. It is often urged, that to say the public money will be more secure in a National",
      "Bank, than in the hands of individuals, as proposed in the Sub-Treasury, is to say,",
      "that Bank directors and Bank officers are more honest than sworn officers of the Government.",
      "Not so. We insist on no such thing. We say that public officers, selected with reference",
      "to their capacity and honesty, (which by the way, we deny is the practice in these",
      "days,) stand an equal chance, precisely, of being capable and honest, with Bank officers",
      "selected by the same rule. We further say, that with however much care selections",
      "may be made, there will be some unfaithful and dishonest in both classes. The experience",
      "of the whole world, in all by-gone times, prove this true. The Saviour of the world",
      "chose twelve disciples, and even one of that small number, selected by super-human",
      "wisdom, turned out a traitor and a devil. And, it may not be improper here to add,",
      "thatJudascarried the bag—was the Sub-Treasurer of the Saviour and his disciples. We, then, do not say, nor need we say, to maintain our proposition, that Bank officers",
      "are more honest than Government officers, selected by the same rule. What we do say,",
      "is, that theinterestof the Sub-Treasurer isagainst his duty—while theinterestof the Bank ison the side of its duty. Take instances—a Sub-Treasurer has in his hands one hundred thousand dollars of",
      "public money; hisdutysays—“You ought to pay this money over”—but hisinterestsays, “You ought to run away with this sum, and be a nabob8the balance of your life.” And who that knows any thing of human nature, doubts that,",
      "in many instances, interest will prevail over duty, and that the Sub-Treasurer will",
      "prefer opulent knavery in a foreign land, to honest poverty at home? But how different",
      "is it with a Bank. Besides the Government money deposited with it, it is doing business",
      "upon a large capital of its own. If it proves faithful to the Government, it continues",
      "its business; if unfaithful, it forfeits its charter, breaks up its business, and",
      "thereby loses more than all it can make by seizing upon the Government funds in its",
      "possession. Itsinterest, therefore, is on the side of its duty—is to be faithful to the Government, and consequently,",
      "even the dishonest amongst its managers, have no temptation to be faithless to it.—Even",
      "if robberies happen in the Bank, the losses are borne by the Bank, and the Government",
      "loses nothing. It is for this reason then, that we say a Bank is the more secure.",
      "It is because of that admirable feature in the Bank system, which places theinterestand thedutyof the depository both on one side; whereas that feature can never enter into the",
      "Sub-Treasury system. By the latter, theinterestof the individuals keeping the public money, will wage an eternal war with theirduty, and in very many instances must be victorious. In answer to the argument drawn",
      "from the fact that individual depositories of public money, have always proved unsafe,",
      "it is urged that even if we had a National Bank, the money has topass throughthe same individual hands, that it will under the Sub-Treasury. This is only partially",
      "true in fact, and wholly fallacious in argument. It is only partially true, in fact, because by the Sub-Treasury bill, four Receivers",
      "General are to be appointed by thePresidentand Senate. These are new officers, and consequently, it cannot be true that the",
      "money, or any portion of it, has heretofore passed thro’ their hands. These four new officers are to be located at New York,Boston,CharlestonandSt. Louis, and consequently are to be the depositories of all the money collected at or near",
      "those points; so that more than three-fourths of the public money will fall into the",
      "keeping of these four new officers, which did not exist as officers under the National",
      "Bank system. It is only partially true, then, that the money passes through the same",
      "hands, under a National Bank, as it would do under the Sub-Treasury.9 It is true, that under either system, individuals must be employed as Collectors of",
      "the Customs, Receivers at the Land Offices, &c. &c. but the difference is, that under the Bank system, the Receivers of all sorts, receive",
      "the money and pay it over to the Bank once a week when the collections are large,",
      "and once a month when they are small, whereas, by the Sub-Treasury system, individuals",
      "are not only to collect the money, but they are tokeepit also, or pay it over to other individuals equally unsafe as themselves, to be",
      "by them kept, until it is wanted for disbursement. It is during the time that it",
      "is thus lying idle in their hands, that opportunity is afforded, and temptation held",
      "out to them to embezzle and escape with it. By the Bank system, each Collector or",
      "Receiver, is to desposite in Bank all the money in his hands at the end of each month at most, and to send",
      "the Bank certificates of deposite, to the Secretary of the Treasury. Whenever that certificate of deposite fails to arrive at the proper time, the Secretaryknowsthat the officers thus failing, is acting the knave; and if he is himself disposed",
      "to do his duty, he has him immedi-<Page 6>ately removed from office, and thereby cuts him off from the possibility of embezzling",
      "but little more than the receipts of a single month. But by the Sub-Treasury System,",
      "the money is to lie month after month in the hands of individuals; larger amounts",
      "are to accumulate in the hands of the Receivers General, and some others, by perhaps",
      "ten to one, than ever accumulated in the hands of individuals before; yet during all",
      "this time, in relation to this great stake, the Secretary of the Treasury can comparatively",
      "know nothing. Reports, to be sure, he will have, but reports are often false, and",
      "always false when made by a knave to cloak his knavery. Long experience has shown,",
      "that nothing short of an actual demand of the money will expose an adroit peculator.",
      "Ask him for reports and he will give them to your heart’s content; send agents to",
      "examine and count the money in his hands, and he will borrow of a friend, merely to",
      "be counted and then returned, a sufficient sum to make the sum square. Try what you",
      "will, it will all fail till you demand the money—then, and not till then, the truth",
      "will come. The sum of the whole matter, I take to be this: Under the Bank system, while sums",
      "of money, by the law, were permitted to lie in the hands of individuals,for very short periods only, many and very large defalcations occurred by those individuals. Under the Sub-Treasury",
      "system,much larger sumsare to lie in the hands of individualsfor much longer periods, thereby multiplyingtemptationin proportion as the sumsare larger; and multiplyingopportunityin proportion as the periodsare longerto, and for, those individuals to embezzle and escape with the public treasure;",
      "and, therefore, just in the proportion, that thetemptationand theopportunityare greater under the Sub-Treasury than the Bank system, will the peculations and",
      "defalcations be greater under the former than they have been under the latter. The",
      "truth of this, independent of actual experience, is but little less than self-evident.",
      "I therefore, leave it. But it is said, and truly too, that there is to be aPenitentiary Departmentto the Sub-Treasury. This, the advocates of the system will have it, will be a “hing-cure-all.” Before I go farther, may I not ask if thePenitentiary Department, is not itself an admission that they expect the public money to be stolen? Why",
      "build the cage if they expect to catch no birds? But to the question how effectual",
      "the Pentenitiary will be in preventing defalcations. How effectual have Penitentiaries heretofore",
      "been in preventing the crimes they were established to suppress? Has not confinement",
      "in them long been the legal penalty of larceny, forgery, robbery, and many other crimes,",
      "in almost all the States? And yet, are not those crimes committed weekly, daily,",
      "nay, and even hourly, in every one of those States? Again, the gallows has long been",
      "the penalty of murder, and yet we scarcely open a newspaper, that does not relate",
      "a new case of that crime. If then, the Penitentiary has everheretoforefailed to prevent larceny, forgery and robbery, and the gallows and halter have likewise",
      "failed to prevent murder, by what process of reasoning, I ask, is it that we are to",
      "conclude the Penitentiary willhereafterprevent the stealing of the public money? But our opponents seem to think they answer",
      "the charge, that the money will be stolen, fully, if they can show that they will",
      "bring the offenders to punishment. Not so. Will the punishment of the thief bring",
      "back the stolen money? No more so than the hanging of a murderer restores his victim",
      "to life. What is the object desired?—Certainly not the greatest number of thieves",
      "we can catch, but that the money may not be stolen. If, then, any plan can be devised",
      "for depositing the public treasure, where it will be never stolen, never embezzled,",
      "is not that the plan to be adopted? Turn, then, to a National Bank, and you have",
      "that plan, fully and completely successful, as tested by the experience of forty years.10 I have now done with the three propositions that the Sub-Treasury would injuriously",
      "affect the currency, and would be moreexpensiveandless secureas a depository of the public money than a National Bank. How far I have succeeded",
      "in establishing their truth, is for others to judge. Omitting, for want of time, what I had intended to say as to the effect of the Sub-Treasury,",
      "to bring the public money under the more immediate control of thePresident, than it has ever heretofore been, I now only ask the audience, when Mr.Calhounshall answer me,to hold him to the questions.11Permit him not to escape them. Require himeitherto show, that the Sub-Treasurywould notinjuriously affect thecurrency, or that we should in some way, receive an equivalent for that injurious effect.",
      "Require himeitherto show that the Sub-Treasurywould not be more expensiveas a fiscal agent, than a Bank, or that we should, in some way, be compensated for",
      "that additional expense. And particularly<Page 7>require him to show, that the public moneywould be as securein the Sub-Treasury as in a National Bank, or that the additionalinsecuritywould be overbalanced by some good result of the proposed change. No one of them, in my humble judgment, will he be able to do; and I venture the prediction,",
      "and ask that it may be especially noted,that he will not attempt to answer the proposition,that the Sub-Treasury would be more expensive than a National Bank,as a fiscal agent of the Government. As a sweeping objection to a National Bank, and consequently an argument in favor",
      "of the Sub-Treasury as a substitute for it, it often has been urged, and doubtless",
      "will be again, that such a Bank is unconstitutional. We have often heretofore shown,",
      "and therefore, need not in detail, do so again, that a majority of the Revolutionary",
      "patriarchs, whoever acted officially upon the question, commencing with Gen.Washington, and embracingGen. Jackson, the larger number of the signers of the Declaration, and of the framers of the Constitution,",
      "who were in the Congress of 1791, have decided upon their oaths that such a Bank is",
      "constitutional. We have also shown that the votes of Congress, have more often been",
      "in favor of, that against its constitutionality. In addition to all this, we have",
      "shown that theSupreme Court—that tribunal which the Constitution has itself established to decide Constitutional",
      "questions—has solemnly decided that such a Bank is constitutional.12Protesting that these authorities ought to settle the question—ought to be conclusive,",
      "I will not urge them further now. I now propose to take a view of the question, which",
      "I have not known to be taken by any one before. It is, that whatever objection ever",
      "has, or ever can be made to the constitutionality of a Bank, will apply with equal",
      "force in its whole length, breadth and proportions, to the Sub-Treasury. Our opponents",
      "say, there is noexpressauthority in the Constitution to establish aBank, and therefore a Bank is unconstitutional; but we, with equal truth, may say, there",
      "is noexpressauthority in the Constitution to establish aSub-Treasury, and therefore a Sub-Treasury is unconstitutional. Who then, has the advantage of",
      "this “express authority” argument? Does it not cut equally both ways? Does it not wound them as deeply and",
      "as deadly as it does us? Our position is that both are constitutional. The Constitution enumerates expressly",
      "several powers which Congress may exercise, superadded to which is a general authority,",
      "“to make all laws necessary and proper,” for carrying into effect all the powers vested by the Constitution of the Government",
      "of the United States.13One of the express powers given Congress, is “To lay and collect taxes; duties, imposts, and excises; to pay the debts, and provide",
      "for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.14”—Now, Congress is expressly authorised to make all laws necessary and proper for",
      "carrying this power into execution. To carry it into execution, it is indispensably",
      "necessary to collect, safely keep, transfer, and disburse a revenue. To do this,",
      "a Bank is “necessary and proper.” But, say our opponents, to authorize the making",
      "of a Bank, thenecessitymust be so great, that the power just recited, would be nugatory without it; and",
      "that thatnecessityis expressly negatived by the fact, that they have got alongtenwhole years without such aBank. Immediately we turn on them, and say, that that sort ofnecessityfor aSub-Treasurydoes not exist, because we have got alongfortywhole years without one. And this time, it may be observed, that we are not merely",
      "equal with them in the argument, but we beat themfortytoten, or which is the same thing,fourtoone. On examination, it will be found, that the absurd rule, which prescribes that before",
      "we can constitutionally adopt a National Bank as a fiscal agent, we must show anindispensable necessityfor it, will exclude every sort of fiscal agent that the mind of man can conceive.",
      "ABankis notindispensable, because we can take theSub-Treasury; theSub-Treasuryis notindispensablebecause we can take theBank. The rule is too absurd to need further comment. Upon the phrase “necessary and proper,” in the Constitution, it seems to me more reasonable to say, thatsomefiscal agent isindispensably necessary; but, inasmuch as noparticular sortof agent is thusindispensable, because someothersort might be adopted, we are left to choose that sort of agent, which may be most",
      "“proper” on grounds of expediency. But it is said the Constitution gives no power to Congress to pass acts of incorporation.",
      "Indeed! What is the passing an act of incorporation, but themaking of a law? Is any one wise enough to tell? The Constitution expressly gives Congress power",
      "“to pass all laws necessary and proper,” &c. If, then, the passing of a Bank charter, be the “making<Page 8>a law necessary and proper,” is it not clearly within the constitutional power of Congress to do so? I now leave the Bank and the Sub-Treasury to try to answer, in a brief way, some of",
      "the arguments which, on previous evenings here, have been urged by Messrs.Lambornand Douglass. Mr. Lamborn admits, that “errors,” as he charitably calls them, have occurred under the present and late administrations;",
      "but he insists that as great “errors” have occurred under all administrations. This, we respectfully deny. We admit that",
      "errors may have occurred under all administrations; but we insist that there isno parallelbetween them and those of the two last. If they can show that their errors are no",
      "greater in number and magnitude, than those of former times, we call off the dogs. But they can do no such thing. To be brief, I will now attempt a contrast of the",
      "“errors” of the two latter, with those of former administrations, in relation to the",
      "public expenditures only. What I am now about to say, as to the expenditures, will",
      "be, in all cases, exclusive of payments on the National debt. By an examination of",
      "authentic public documents, consisting of the regular series of annual reports, made",
      "by all the Secretaries of the Treasury from the establishment of the Government down",
      "to the close of the year 1838, the following contrasts will be presented. 1st. The lasttenyears under Gen. Jackson and Mr. Van Buren, cost more money than the firsttwenty-sevendid, (including the heavy expenses of thelate British war,) under Washington, Adams,JeffersonandMadison. 2d. The last year ofJ. Q.",
      "Adams’ administration cost, in round numbers,thirteenmillions, being aboutonedollar to each soul in the nation; the last (1838) of Mr. Van Buren’s costfortymillions, being abouttwo dollars and fifty centsto each soul; and being larger than the expenditure of Mr. Adams in the proportion",
      "offivetotwo. 3d. The highest annual expenditure during the late British war, being in 1814. and",
      "while we had in actual service rising 188,000 militia, together with the whole regular",
      "army, swelling the number to greatly ever 200,000, and they to be clad, fed and transported from point to point, with great",
      "rapidity and corresponding expense, and to be furnished with arms and ammunition,",
      "and they to be transported in like manner, and at like expense, was no more in round",
      "numbers thanthirtymillions; whereas, the annual expenditure of 1838, under Mr. Van Buren, and while",
      "we were at peace with every government in the world, wasfortymillions; being over the highest year of the late and very expensive war, in the",
      "proportion offourtothree. 4th. Gen. Washington administered the Governmenteightyears forsixteenmillions; Mr. Van Buren administered itoneyear (1838) forfortymillions; so that Mr. Van Buren expendedtwice and a halfas much inoneyear, as Gen.",
      "Washington did ineight, and being in the proportion oftwentytoone—or, in other words, had Gen. Washington administered the Governmenttwentyyears, at the same average expense he did foreight, he would have carried us through the wholetwenty,for no more money than Mr.",
      "Van Buren has expended in getting us through the singleoneof 1838. Other facts, equally astounding, might be presented from the same authentic document:",
      "but I deem the foregoing abundantly sufficient to establish the proposition, that",
      "there is no parallel between the “errors” of the present and late administrations, and those of former times, and that Mr.",
      "Van Buren is wholly out of the line of all precedents. But, Mr. Douglass, seeing that the enormous expenditure of 1838, has no parallel in",
      "the olden times, comes in with a long list of excuses for it. This list of excuses,",
      "I will rapidly examine, and show, as I think, that the few of them which are true,",
      "prove nothing; and that the majority of them are wholly untrue in fact. He first",
      "says, that the expenditures of that year were made under the appropriations of Congress—one branch of which was a Whig body. It is true that those expenditures were made under the appropriations of Congress;",
      "but it isuntruethat either branch of Congress was aWhigbody. The Senate had fallen into the hands of the administration, more than a year",
      "before, as proven by the passage of the Expunging Resolution;15and at the time those appropriations were made, there were too few Whigs in that",
      "body, to make a respectable struggle, in point of numbers, upon any question.—This",
      "is notorious to all. TheHouse of Representativesthat voted those appropriations, was the same that first assembled at the called",
      "session of September, 1838. Although it refused to pass the Sub-Treasury Bill, a majority of its members were",
      "elected as friends of the administration, and proved their adherance to it, by the election of a Van Buren Speaker, and two Van Buren clerks.16It is clear then, that both branches of the Congress that passed those appropriations",
      "were in the hands of Mr. Van Buren’s friends, so that the Whigs had no power to arrest",
      "them, as Mr. Douglass would insist. And is not the charge of extravagant expenditures,",
      "equally well sustained, if shown to have been made by a Van Buren Congress, as if",
      "shown to have been made in any other way? A Van Buren Congress passed the bill; and",
      "Mr. Van Buren himself approved them, and consequently the party are wholly responsible",
      "for them. Mr. Douglass next says, that a portion of the expenditures of that year, was made",
      "for the purchase of Public Lands from the Indians. Now it happens that no such purchase",
      "was made during that year. It is true, that some money was paid that year in pursuance",
      "of Indian treaties; but no more, or rather not as much, as had been paid on the same",
      "account in each of several preceding years. Next, he says, that theFlorlda warcreated many millions of this year’s expenditure. This is true, and it is also true,",
      "that during that and every other year, that that war has existed, it has cost three",
      "or four times as much as it would have done under an honest and judicious administration",
      "of the Government. The large sums, foolishly, not to say corruptly thrown away in",
      "that war, constitute one of the just causes of complaint against the administration.",
      "Take a single instance. The agents of the Government in connexion with that war, needed a certain Steam boat; the owner proposed to sell it for ten",
      "thousand dollars; the agents refused to give that sum, but hired the boat at one hundred",
      "dollars per day, and keep it at that hire till it amounted to ninety-two thousand dollars. This fact is not found in the public",
      "reports, but depends with me, on the verbal statement of an officer of thenavy, who says he knows it to be true. That the administration ought to be credited for thereasonableexpenses of the Florida war, we have never denied. Thosereasonablecharges, we say, could not exceed one or two millions a year. Deduct such a sum",
      "from the forty miliion expenditure of 1838, and the remainder will still be without a parallel as an annual",
      "expenditure. Again, Mr. Douglass says, that theremoval of the Indiansto the country west of the Mississippi, created much of the expenditure of 1838.",
      "I have examined the public documents in relation to this matter, and find that less",
      "was paid for the removal of Indians in that, than in some former years. The whole",
      "sum expended on that account in that year, did not much exceed one quarter of a million.",
      "For this small sum, altho’ we do not think the administration entitled to credit,",
      "because large sums have been expended in the same way in former years, we consent",
      "it may take one and make the most of it. Next, Mr. Douglass says, that five millions of the expenditures of 1838, consisted",
      "of the payment of theFrench indemnity money to its individual claimants. I have carefully examined the public documents, and thereby find this statement",
      "to be wholly untrue. Of the forty millions of dollars expended in 1838, I am enabled",
      "to say positively, that not one dollar consisted of payments on the French Indemnities.",
      "So much for that excuse. Next comes thePost Office.—He says that five millions were expended during that year to sustain that Department.",
      "By a like examination of public documents, I find this also, wholly untrue. Of the",
      "so often mentioned forty millions, not one dollar went to the Post Office. I am glad,",
      "however, that the Post Offie has been referred to, because it warrants me in digressing a little, to enquire how",
      "it is, that that department of the Government has, become achargeupon the Treasury, whereas under Mr. Adams and the Presidents before him, it not",
      "only, to use a homely phrase, cut its own fodder, but actually threw a surplus into",
      "the Treasury.—Although nothing of the forty millions was paid on that account, in",
      "1838; it is true that five millions are appropriatedto be so expendedin 1839; showing clearly that the department has become achargeupon the Treasury.—How has this happened? I account for it in this way—The chief expense of the Post Office Department consists",
      "of the payments of Contractors for carrying the mail—Contracts for carrying the mails,",
      "are, by law, let to the lowest bidders, after advertisement. This plan introduces",
      "competition, and insures the transportation of the mails at fair prices, so long as",
      "it is faithfully adhered to. It hasever been adhered to until Mr.Barrywas made Post Master General. When he came into office he formed the purpose of",
      "throwing the mail contracts into the hands, of his friends to the exclusion of his",
      "opponents. To effect this, the plan of letting to the lowest bidder, must be evaded,",
      "and it must be done in this way—The favorite bid less by perhaps three or four hundred",
      "per cent. than the contract could be performed for, and consequently shutting out all honest",
      "competition, became the<Page 9>contractor. The Post Master General would immediately add some slight additional",
      "duty to the contract, and under the pretence of extra allowance for extra services,",
      "run the contract to double, triple, and often quadruple, what honest and fair bidders",
      "had proposed to take it at. In 1834 the finances of the department had become so",
      "deranged, that total concealment was no longer possible, and consequently a committee",
      "of the Senate were directed to make a thorough investigation of its affairs. Their",
      "report is found in the Senate Documents of 1033-’34—Vol. 5, Doc. 422—which Documents",
      "may be seen at the Secretary’s Office, and I presume elsewhere in the State. The",
      "report shows numerous cases, of similar import, of one of which I give the substance—The",
      "contract for carrying the mail upon a certain route, had expired, and of course was",
      "to be let again. The old contractor offered to take it for $300 a year, the mail",
      "to be transported thereon three times a week, or for $600 transported daily. OneJames Reeside, bid $40 for three times a week, or $99 daily, and of course received the contract.",
      "On the examination of the committee, it was discovered that Reeside had received for",
      "the service on this route, which he had contracted to render for less than $100, the",
      "enormous sum of $1,999! This is but a single case. Many similar ones, covering some",
      "ten or twenty pages of a large volume, are given in that report. The Department was",
      "found to be insolvent to the amount of half a million; and to have been so grossly",
      "mismanaged, or rather so corruptly managed, in almost every particular, that the best",
      "friends of the Post Master General made no defence of his administration of it. They",
      "admitted that he was wholly unqualified for that office; but still he was retained",
      "in it by thePresident, until he resigned it voluntarily about a year afterwards. And when he resigned",
      "it what do you think became of him? Why, he sunk into obscurity and disgrace, to be",
      "sure, you will say. No such thing. Well, then, what did become of him? Why thePresidentimmediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost unequalled incapacity and corruption, by appointing him to a foreign mission, with a salary",
      "and outfit of $18,000 a year.—The party now attempt to throw Barry off, and to avoid",
      "the responsibility of his sins.—Did not thePresidentendorse those sins, when on the very heel of their commission, he appointed their",
      "author to the very highest and most honorable office in his gift, and which is but",
      "a single step behind the verygoalof American political ambition?17 I return to another of Mr. Douglass’ excuses for the expenditures of 1838, at the",
      "same time announcing the pleasing intelligence, that this is the last one. He says",
      "that ten millions of that years expenditure, was a contingent appropriation, to prosecute",
      "an anticipated war withGreat Britain, on theMaineboundary question. Few words will settle this. First: that the ten millions appropriated",
      "was notmadetill 1839, and consequently could not have been expended in 1838; and, second: although",
      "it was appropriated, it has never been expended at all. Those who heard Mr. Douglass,",
      "recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me. “Now",
      "he’s got me,” thought I.—But when he went on to say that five millions of the expenditure",
      "of 1838, were payments of the French indemnities,which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had been for the Post Office,which I knew to be untrue;that ten millions had been for the Maine boundary war,which I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough to hope, that I would permit such groundless",
      "and audacious assertions to go unexposed. I readily consented, that on the score",
      "both of veracity and sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the",
      "more deserving of the world’s contempt.18 Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party, and the Whigs",
      "is, that although the former sometimes err inpractice, they are always correct inprinciple—whereas the latter are wrong inprinciple—and the better to impress this proposition, he uses a figurative expression in these",
      "words: “TheDemocratsare vulnerable in the heel, but they are sound in the head and the heart.” The first branch of the figure, that is that the Democrats are vulnerable in the",
      "heel, I admit is not merely figuratively, but literally true. Who that looks but",
      "for a moment, at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their hundreds",
      "of others, scampering away with the public money toTexas, toEurope, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice,",
      "can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in theirheelswith a species of “running itch.” It seems that this malady of their heels, operates on thesesound-headedandhonest-heartedcreatures, very much like the cork-leg, in the comic song, did on its owner; which,",
      "when he had once got started on it, the more he tried to stop it, the more it would",
      "run away.19At the hazard of wearing this point thread bare, I will relate an anecdote, which",
      "seems too strikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier, who was always",
      "boasting of his bravery, when no danger was near, but who invariably retreated without",
      "orders at the first charge of an engagement, being asked by his Captain why he did",
      "so, replied: “Captain, I have as brave aheartasJulius Cæsarever had; but some how or other, whenever danger approaches, mycowardlylegs will run away with it.” So with Mr. Lamborn’s party. They take the public moneyintotheir hand for the most laudable purpose, thatwise headsandhonest heartscan dictate; but before they can possibly get itoutagain, their rascally “vulnerable heels” will run away with them. Seriously: this proposition of Mr. Lamborn is nothing more or less, than a request",
      "that his party may be tried by theirprofessionsinstead of theirpractices. Perhaps no position that the party assumes is more liable to, or more deserving",
      "of exposure, than this very modest request; and nothing but the unwarrantable length,",
      "to which I have already extended these remarks, forbids me now attempting to expose",
      "it. For the reason given, I pass it by. I shall advert to but one more point. Mr. Lamborn refers to the late elections in the States, and from their results, confidently",
      "predicts, that every State in the Union will vote for Mr. Van Buren at thenext Presidential election. Addressthatargument tocowardsand toknaves; with thefreeand thebraveit will effect nothing. Itmaybe true, if itmust, let it.",
      "Many free countries have lost their liberty; andours maylose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was thelastto desert, but that Ineverdeserted her. I know that the great volcano atWashington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that reigns there, is belching forth the",
      "lava of political corruption, in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping with",
      "frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to",
      "leave unscathed no green spot or living thing, while on its bosom are riding like",
      "demons on the waves of Hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and fiendishly taunting",
      "all those who dare resist its destroying course, with the hopelessness of their effort;",
      "and knowing this, I cannot deny that all may be swept away. Broken by it, I too,",
      "may be; bow to it, I never will. Theprobabilitythat we may fall in the struggleought notto deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; itshall notdeter me. If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those dimensions",
      "not wholly unworthy of its Almighty Architect, it is when I contemplate the cause",
      "of my country, deserted by all the world beside, and I standing up boldly and alone,",
      "and hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors. Here, without contemplating consequences,",
      "before High Heaven, and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to the",
      "just cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty and my love. And who,",
      "that thinks with me, will not fearlessly adopt the oath that I take. Let none faulter, who thinks he is right, and we may succeed. But, if after all, we shall fail, be",
      "it so—We still shall have the proud consolation of saying to our consciences, and",
      "to the departed shade of our country’s freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment,",
      "and adored of our hearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death, weneverfaultered in defending."

I expect to hear it said, that it is not the\n               policy of the Administration to collect the revenue in specie.  If it shall, I reply,\n               that Mr.Van Buren, in his message recommending the Sub-Treasury, expended nearly a column of that document\n               in an attempt to persuadeCongressto provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes\n               with these words.  “It may be safely assumed, that no motive ofconvenienceto thecitizen, requires the reception of Bank paper.”3In addition to this, Mr.Silas Wright, Senator fromNew York, and the political, personal and confidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and\n               introduced into theSenatethe first Sub-Treasury Bill, and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the\n               revenue in specie.4It is true, I know, that that clause was stricken from the bill, but it was done\n               by the votes of the Whigs, aided by a portion only of the Van Buren Senators.  No\n               Sub-Treasury bill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by\n               Congress, some with and some without the specie clause;5so that I admit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the administration\n               favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it, that the fact that thePresidentat first urged the specie doctrine, and that under his recommendation the first bill\n               introduced embraced it, warrants us in charging it as the policy of theparty, until their head as publicly recants it, as he at first espoused it—I repeat then,\n               that by the Sub-Treasury, the revenue is to be collected inspecie. Now mark what the effect of this must be.  By all estimates ever made, there are\n               but between 60 and 80 millions of specie in the United States.  The expenditures of\n               the Government for the year 1838, the last for which we have had the report, were\n               40 millions.  Thus it is seen, that if the whole revenue be collected in specie, it\n               will take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it.  By this means,\n               more than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen million of souls, who compose\n               the whole population of the country, is thrown into the hands of the public office-holders,\n               and other public creditors, composing in number, perhaps not more than one quarter\n               of a million; leaving the other fourteen millions and three quarters to get along\n               as they best can, with less than one half of the specie of the country, and whatever\n               rags and shin-plasters they may be able to put, and keep, in circulation.  By this\n               means, every office holder, and other public creditor may, and most likely will, set\n               up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the specie men have of it; each specie\n               man, upon a fair division, having to his share, the fleecing of about 59 rag men.—*6"

This, the advocates of the system will have it, will be a “hing-cure-all.” Before I go farther, may I not ask if thePenitentiary Department, is not itself an admission that they expect the public money to be stolen?  Why\n               build the cage if they expect to catch no birds? But to the question how effectual\n               the Pentenitiary will be in preventing defalcations.  How effectual have Penitentiaries heretofore\n               been in preventing the crimes they were established to suppress?  Has not confinement\n               in them long been the legal penalty of larceny, forgery, robbery, and many other crimes,\n               in almost all the States?  And yet, are not those crimes committed weekly, daily,\n               nay, and even hourly, in every one of those States? Again, the gallows has long been\n               the penalty of murder, and yet we scarcely open a newspaper, that does not relate\n               a new case of that crime.  If then, the Penitentiary has everheretoforefailed to prevent larceny, forgery and robbery, and the gallows and halter have likewise\n               failed to prevent murder, by what process of reasoning, I ask, is it that we are to\n               conclude the Penitentiary willhereafterprevent the stealing of the public money? But our opponents seem to think they answer\n               the charge, that the money will be stolen, fully, if they can show that they will\n               bring the offenders to punishment.  Not so.  Will the punishment of the thief bring\n               back the stolen money? No more so than the hanging of a murderer restores his victim\n               to life.  What is the object desired?—Certainly not the greatest number of thieves\n               we can catch, but that the money may not be stolen.  If, then, any plan can be devised\n               for depositing the public treasure, where it will be never stolen, never embezzled,\n               is not that the plan to be adopted?  Turn, then, to a National Bank, and you have\n               that plan, fully and completely successful, as tested by the experience of forty years.10"

We have often heretofore shown,\n               and therefore, need not in detail, do so again, that a majority of the Revolutionary\n               patriarchs, whoever acted officially upon the question, commencing with Gen.Washington, and embracingGen. Jackson, the larger number of the signers of the Declaration, and of the framers of the Constitution,\n               who were in the Congress of 1791, have decided upon their oaths that such a Bank is\n               constitutional. We have also shown that the votes of Congress, have more often been\n               in favor of, that against its constitutionality.  In addition to all this, we have\n               shown that theSupreme Court—that tribunal which the Constitution has itself established to decide Constitutional\n               questions—has solemnly decided that such a Bank is constitutional.12Protesting that these authorities ought to settle the question—ought to be conclusive,\n               I will not urge them further now.  I now propose to take a view of the question, which\n               I have not known to be taken by any one before.  It is, that whatever objection ever\n               has, or ever can be made to the constitutionality of a Bank, will apply with equal\n               force in its whole length, breadth and proportions, to the Sub-Treasury.  Our opponents\n               say, there is noexpressauthority in the Constitution to establish aBank, and therefore a Bank is unconstitutional; but we, with equal truth, may say, there\n               is noexpressauthority in the Constitution to establish aSub-Treasury, and therefore a Sub-Treasury is unconstitutional.  Who then, has the advantage of\n               this “express authority” argument? Does it not cut equally both ways?  Does it not wound them as deeply and\n               as deadly as it does us?"

The Constitution enumerates expressly\n               several powers which Congress may exercise, superadded to which is a general authority,\n               “to make all laws necessary and proper,” for carrying into effect all the powers vested by the Constitution of the Government\n               of the United States.13One of the express powers given Congress, is “To lay and collect taxes; duties, imposts, and excises; to pay the debts,  and provide\n                  for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.14”—Now, Congress is expressly authorised to make all laws necessary and proper for\n               carrying this power into execution.  To carry it into execution, it is indispensably\n               necessary to collect, safely keep, transfer, and disburse a revenue.  To do this,\n               a Bank is “necessary and proper.”  But, say our opponents, to authorize the making\n               of a Bank, thenecessitymust be so great, that the power just recited, would be nugatory without it; and\n               that thatnecessityis expressly negatived by the fact, that they have got alongtenwhole years without such aBank. Immediately we turn on them, and say, that that sort ofnecessityfor aSub-Treasurydoes not exist, because we have got alongfortywhole years without one.  And this time, it may be observed, that we are not merely\n               equal with them in the argument, but we beat themfortytoten, or which is the same thing,fourtoone. On examination, it will be found, that the absurd rule, which prescribes that before\n               we can constitutionally adopt a National Bank as a fiscal agent, we must show anindispensable necessityfor it, will exclude every sort of fiscal agent that the mind of man can conceive.\n               ABankis notindispensable, because we can take theSub-Treasury; theSub-Treasuryis notindispensablebecause we can take theBank.  The rule is too absurd to need further comment.  Upon the phrase “necessary and proper,” in the Constitution, it seems to me more reasonable to say, thatsomefiscal agent isindispensably necessary; but, inasmuch as noparticular sortof agent is thusindispensable, because someothersort might be adopted, we are left to choose that sort of agent, which may be most\n               “proper” on grounds of expediency."

This list of excuses,\n               I will rapidly examine, and show, as I think, that the few of them which are true,\n               prove nothing; and that the majority of them are wholly untrue in fact.  He first\n               says, that the expenditures of that year were made under the appropriations of Congress—one branch of which was a Whig body. It is true that those expenditures were made under the appropriations of Congress;\n               but it isuntruethat either branch of Congress was aWhigbody. The Senate had fallen into the hands of the administration, more than a year\n               before, as proven by the passage of the Expunging Resolution;15and at the time those appropriations were made, there were too few Whigs in that\n               body, to make a respectable struggle, in point of numbers, upon any question.—This\n               is notorious to all.  TheHouse of Representativesthat voted those appropriations, was the same that first assembled at the called\n               session of September, 1838.  Although it refused to pass the Sub-Treasury Bill, a majority of its members were\n               elected as friends of the administration, and proved their adherance to it, by the election of a Van Buren Speaker, and two Van Buren clerks.16It is clear then, that both branches of the Congress that passed those appropriations\n               were in the hands of Mr. Van Buren’s friends, so that the Whigs had no power to arrest\n               them, as Mr. Douglass would insist.  And is not the charge of extravagant expenditures,\n               equally well sustained, if shown to have been made by a Van Buren Congress, as if\n               shown to have been made in any other way?

This plan introduces\n               competition, and insures the transportation of the mails at fair prices, so long as\n               it is faithfully adhered to.  It hasever been adhered to until Mr.Barrywas made Post Master General.  When he came into office he formed the purpose of\n               throwing the mail contracts into the hands, of his friends to the exclusion of his\n               opponents.  To effect this, the plan of letting to the lowest bidder, must be evaded,\n               and it must be done in this way—The favorite bid less by perhaps three or four hundred\n               per cent.  than the contract could be performed for, and consequently shutting out all honest\n               competition, became the<Page 9>contractor.  The Post Master General would immediately add some slight additional\n               duty to the contract, and under the pretence of extra allowance for extra services,\n               run the contract to double, triple, and often quadruple, what honest and fair bidders\n               had proposed to take it at.  In 1834 the finances of the department had become so\n               deranged, that total concealment was no longer possible, and consequently a committee\n               of the Senate were directed to make a thorough investigation of its affairs.  Their\n               report is found in the Senate Documents of 1033-’34—Vol. 5, Doc. 422—which Documents\n               may be seen at the Secretary’s Office, and I presume elsewhere in the State.  The\n               report shows numerous cases, of similar import, of one of which I give the substance—The\n               contract for carrying the mail upon a certain route, had expired, and of course was\n               to be let again.  The old contractor offered to take it for $300 a year, the mail\n               to be transported thereon three times a week, or for $600 transported daily.  OneJames Reeside, bid $40 for three times a week, or $99 daily, and of course received the contract.\n               On the examination of the committee, it was discovered that Reeside had received for\n               the service on this route, which he had contracted to render for less than $100, the\n               enormous sum of $1,999!  This is but a single case.  Many similar ones, covering some\n               ten or twenty pages of a large volume, are given in that report.  The Department was\n               found to be insolvent to the amount of half a million; and to have been so grossly\n               mismanaged, or rather so corruptly managed, in almost every particular, that the best\n               friends of the Post Master General made no defence of his administration of it.  They\n               admitted that he was wholly unqualified for that office; but still he was retained\n               in it by thePresident, until he resigned it voluntarily about a year afterwards.  And when he resigned\n               it what do you think became of him? Why, he sunk into obscurity and disgrace, to be\n               sure, you will say.  No such thing.  Well, then, what did become of him? Why thePresidentimmediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost unequalled incapacity and corruption, by appointing him to a foreign mission, with a salary\n               and outfit of $18,000 a year.—The party now attempt to throw Barry off, and to avoid\n               the responsibility of his sins.—Did not thePresidentendorse those sins, when on the very heel of their commission, he appointed their\n               author to the very highest and most honorable office in his gift, and which is but\n               a single step behind the verygoalof American political ambition?17"

        "text": "I return to another of Mr. Douglass’ excuses for the expenditures of 1838, at the\n               same time announcing the pleasing intelligence, that this is the last one.  He says\n               that ten millions of that years expenditure, was a contingent appropriation, to prosecute\n               an anticipated war withGreat Britain, on theMaineboundary question.  Few words will settle this.  First: that the ten millions appropriated\n               was notmadetill 1839, and consequently could not have been expended in 1838; and, second: although\n               it was appropriated, it has never been expended at all.  Those who heard Mr. Douglass,\n               recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me.  “Now\n               he’s got me,” thought I.—But when he went on to say that five millions of the expenditure\n               of 1838, were payments of the French indemnities,which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had been for the Post Office,which I knew to be untrue;that ten millions had been for the Maine boundary war,which I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough to hope, that I would permit such groundless\n               and audacious assertions to go unexposed.  I readily consented, that on the score\n               both of veracity and sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the\n               more deserving of the world’s contempt.18"

Who that looks but\n               for a moment, at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their hundreds\n               of others, scampering away with the public money toTexas, toEurope, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice,\n               can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in theirheelswith a species of “running itch.” It seems that this malady of their heels, operates on thesesound-headedandhonest-heartedcreatures, very much like the cork-leg, in the comic song, did on its owner; which,\n               when he had once got started on it, the more he tried to stop it, the more it would\n               run away.19At the hazard of wearing this point thread bare, I will relate an anecdote, which\n               seems too strikingly in point to be omitted.  A witty Irish soldier, who was always\n               boasting of his bravery, when no danger was near, but who invariably retreated without\n               orders at the first charge of an engagement, being asked by his Captain why he did\n               so, replied: “Captain, I have as brave aheartasJulius Cæsarever had; but some how or other, whenever danger approaches, mycowardlylegs will run away with it.” So with Mr. Lamborn’s party.  They take the public moneyintotheir hand for the most laudable purpose, thatwise headsandhonest heartscan dictate; but before they can possibly get itoutagain, their rascally “vulnerable heels” will run away with them."

Perhaps no position that the party assumes is more liable to, or more deserving\n               of exposure, than this very modest request; and nothing but the unwarrantable length,\n               to which I have already extended these remarks, forbids me now attempting to expose\n               it.  For the reason given, I pass it by."

Addressthatargument tocowardsand toknaves; with thefreeand thebraveit will effect nothing.  Itmaybe true, if itmust, let it.  Many free countries have lost their liberty; andours maylose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was thelastto desert, but that Ineverdeserted her.  I know that the great volcano atWashington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that reigns there, is belching forth the\n               lava of political corruption, in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping with\n               frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to\n               leave unscathed no green spot or living thing, while on its bosom are riding like\n               demons on the waves of Hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and fiendishly taunting\n               all those who dare resist its destroying course, with the hopelessness of their effort;\n               and knowing this, I cannot deny that all may be swept away.  Broken by it, I too,\n               may be; bow to it, I never will.  Theprobabilitythat we may fall in the struggleought notto deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; itshall notdeter me.  If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those dimensions\n               not wholly unworthy of its Almighty Architect, it is when I contemplate the cause\n               of my country, deserted by all the world beside, and I standing up boldly and alone,\n               and hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors.  Here, without contemplating consequences,\n               before High Heaven, and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to the\n               just cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty and my love.  And who,\n               that thinks with me, will not fearlessly adopt the oath that I take. Let none faulter, who thinks he is right, and we may succeed.  But, if after all, we shall fail, be\n               it so—We still shall have the proud consolation of saying to our consciences, and\n               to the departed shade of our country’s freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment,\n               and adored of our hearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death, weneverfaultered in defending."
