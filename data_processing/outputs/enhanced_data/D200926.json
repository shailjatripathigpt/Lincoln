The only object of government, the\n\ngood of the governed, not the interests of Slaveholders— the securing of life, liberty\n\nand the pursuit of happiness; this true end of all Government was well enforced.9The Kentuckian,Lincoln, defended the Declaration of American Independence against the attacks of the degenerate\n\nVermonter,Douglas, and againstBreckenridgeand the whole ruling class of the South. Here was a Southerner, with eloquence that\n\nwould bear a comparison withHenry Clay’s, defending Liberty and the North against the leaders of the Border Rufffians and Doughfaces ofIllinois.10Stephen A. Douglas, the traitor to Freedom, was exposed, and his arguments refuted byLincoln. This associate ofHeckerreferred to the Germans and the noble position taken by them in just and dignified\n\nterms.11When he called down the blessings of the Almighty on their heads, a thrill of sympathy\n\nand pleasure ran through his whole audience. They all rejoiced that clap-traps, false\n\nissues and humbugs are powerless with the great heart ofGermanyin America.12LincolnandHeckerwere inscribed on many banners. They are worthy advocates of a worthy cause— honest\n\nmen and lovers of Liberty, whose hearts beat in unison with the heart of the people\n\nall over the world.Patrick HenryandJeffersonandWashingtonwere not more devoted to our great and noble cause than are these two eloquent men.\n\nThey are as true Democrats as ever trod the earth, and what is more in modern America,\n\nthey are Republicans. Compared withDouglas,Lincolnis likeHyperionto a Satyr.13The one is a man of genius, of ideas, of principle, of eloquence, and the noblest\n\nwork of God— an honest man. The other is the friend and associate ofDon Morrison— a man of mere words, a stump orator of mechanical clap trap, without ideas, and\n\nhardly with the pretension to any principle or honesty.

Osterhauswho carried the banner bearing the final slogan on enjoying the fruits of one’s labor.\n                  In Kerr’s memory, the banner inspired Lincoln to argue in his speech that the sentiment\n                  was the base policy of the United States government, and that “every man should have\n                  the full benefit of all his labor, developing the ability to care for himself, rather\n                  than trusting to the care of employers.”A paragraph from the newspaper article is here editorially omitted. The omitted paragraph\n                  describes the animating sentiment of the meeting as opposition of the extension of\n                  slavery into the territories, recounts the arrival of a delegation from St. Louis,\n                  and laments the absence of speaker of the U.S. House of RepresentativesNathaniel P.

Trumbull\n                  had been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1854, but prior\n                  to the beginning of his term inCongress, in February 1855 theIllinois General Assemblyinstead selected him to represent Illinois in theU.S. Senate. When Trumbull presented his credentials in the U.S. Senate, his eligibility for\n                  that office was challenged, and it was March 1856 before he was confirmed as a senator.While the matter of Trumbull’s Senate seat was being resolved,Philip B. Foukebegan petitioning the U.S. House of Representatives in February 1856 claiming Trumbull’s\n                  as-yet-unvacated House seat. Fouke was one of the candidates that Trumbull had defeated\n                  for the seat in theelection of 1854. The House of Representatives ultimately rejected Fouke’s petition on April 10, 1856,\n                  stating that he had not been duly elected to the position, and at that same time the\n                  body finally declared Trumbull’s House seat vacant. The Eighth Congressional District\n                  of Illinois would ultimately vote in a special election on November 4, 1856, for a\n                  representative to fill Trumbull’s vacancy.James L. D. Morrisonwon that election with 55.8 percent of the vote and served from November 1856 to\n                  March 1857.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.

They had been recommended\n                  by committee and unanimously approved as electors for what would become the Illinois\n                  Republican Party at theIllinois Anti-Nebraska ConventioninBloomingtonon May 29, 1856. Hecker was viewed as a boon to the Republican cause during the 1856\n                  election due to his appeal among German American voters, who were familiar with his\n                  political activities in Germany. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actin 1854 caused German Americans who opposed the expansion of slavery to re-evaluate\n                  their political affiliations. The nascent Republican Party, with its free-soil position,\n                  appealed to German immigrants and party leaders actively worked to recruit German\n                  American voters in the 1856 election.Ezra M.

All the speakers desplayed much ablility; ourtrue representativespoke, as he always does, with power and effect.5The palm, however, belongs to Mr.Lincoln; his wasthespeech of the day.  We have heard him twice before, atBloomington, on the29th of Maylast, and atSpringfield, on the 25th ult.6The delighted thousands who heard him then will appreciate his eloquence when they\n               learn that he surpassed those efforts in his speech to the vast assembly of Republicans\n               in Belleville.  He showed that there are only two parties and only two questions now\n               before the voters.  A Kentuckian, as he is, familiar with Slavery and its evils, he\n               vindicated the cause of free labor, “that national capital,” in the language of Col. [Colonel]Fremont, “which constitutes the real wealth of this great country, and creates that intelligent\n               power in the masses alone to be relied on as the bulwark of free institutions.”7He showed the tendency and aim of the ShamDemocracyto degrade labor to subvert the true ends of Government and build up Aristocricy, Despotism and Slavery.  The platforms ofBuchananandFremontwere contrasted, and the opposite tendency of each to the other was shown with the\n               clearness of light.8The rights of man were eloquently vindicated.  The only object of government, the\n               good of the governed, not the interests of Slaveholders— the securing of life, liberty\n               and the pursuit of happiness; this true end of all Government was well enforced.9The Kentuckian,Lincoln, defended the Declaration of American Independence against the attacks of the degenerate\n               Vermonter,Douglas, and againstBreckenridgeand the whole ruling class of the South.  Here was a Southerner, with eloquence that\n               would bear a comparison withHenry Clay’s, defending Liberty and the North against the leaders of the Border Rufffians and Doughfaces ofIllinois.10Stephen A. Douglas, the traitor to Freedom, was exposed, and his arguments refuted byLincoln.  This associate ofHeckerreferred to the Germans and the noble position taken by them in just and dignified\n               terms.11When he called down the blessings of the Almighty on their heads, a thrill of sympathy\n               and pleasure ran through his whole audience.  They all rejoiced that clap-traps, false\n               issues and humbugs are powerless with the great heart ofGermanyin America.12LincolnandHeckerwere inscribed on many banners.  They are worthy advocates of a worthy cause— honest\n               men and lovers of Liberty, whose hearts beat in unison with the heart of the people\n               all over the world.Patrick HenryandJeffersonandWashingtonwere not more devoted to our great and noble cause than are these two eloquent men.\n               They are as true Democrats as ever trod the earth, and what is more in modern America,\n               they are Republicans. Compared withDouglas,Lincolnis likeHyperionto a Satyr.13The one is a man of genius, of ideas, of principle, of eloquence, and the noblest\n               work of God— an honest man.  The other is the friend and associate ofDon Morrison— a man of mere words, a stump orator of mechanical clap trap, without ideas, and\n               hardly with the pretension to any principle or honesty.  Such are the representatives\n               of the two principal parties in ourState.  LetAbraham LincolnsucceedStephen A. Douglasin theSenate of the United States.  Let the Republican press nominate him,  Let the Republican party elect him to that\n               high office.  It will be a great trust bestowed upon integrity and capability.  It\n               will be a high honor conferred upon high merit.Lincolndeserves well of the Republic; all honor to him.14"
