Shepard, along with Linder and Bromwell. The case involved Shepard and Richard\n                  Walker making a contract in which Walker sold Shepard 1,200 hogs. Shepard paid $1,700\n                  in advance, but when Walker failed to deliver the hogs, Shepard sued him for $5,000\n                  in damages. The parties reached an agreement, and the court dismissed the case in\n                  the same month.Shepard v. Walker, Martha L.
