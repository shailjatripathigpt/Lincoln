Writing in Lincoln’s hand on one of the letters indicates that Lincoln\n                  responded to Davis at some point, but no letter from Lincoln to Davis on the subject\n                  has been located. Davis was one of three candidates for the position. In alettertoJosiah B. Herrickin January 1849, Lincoln indicated that he had not pledged himself to any candidate\n                  for the position and was uncertain how to advise any of them.

The Illinois\n                  press published much of the correspondence between Douglas and Lincoln on the subject,\n                  which Eccles most likely saw. After some negotiation on the topic, Lincoln and Douglas\n                  eventually agreed to a debate schedule. These debates became theLincoln-Douglas Debates.TheDaily Illinois State Journalpublished a list of Lincoln’s speaking appointments for August and September in its\n                  August 6 issue.For coverage of Lincoln’s June 16 and July 17 speeches, see:Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 18 June 1858, 2:2-4; 20 July 1858, 2:1-6; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.

        "text": "12If Lincoln penned a response to this letter, it has not been located.Lincoln traveled to Hillsboro on September 8, stayed at Eccles’ home, and delivered\n                  a campaign speech on September 9.Rumors circulated at least as early as July 1858 that pro-Buchanan Democrat Amzi McWilliams\n                  would compete for the Illinois Sixth District’s seat in theU.S. House of Representatives. However, in the end he did not run; incumbent pro-Douglas DemocratThomas L. Harriscompeted with James H. Matheny and John L. McConnell for the seat instead. Matheny\n                  ran as an independent candidate with Republican support; McConnell was a pro-Buchanan\n                  Democrat.Lincoln had  previously expressed concerns about the Republican Party’s chances in\n                  Madison County, just as Eccles does in this letter, in letters to bothJoseph GillespieandGustave P. Koerner. Lyman Trumbull delivered an address inAlton, Illinoisin Madison County on August 25. Lincoln delivered a campaign speech inEdwardsville, Illinoisin Madison County on September 11.Lincoln did not deliver a campaign address in Pana, Illinois during the election campaign\n                  of 1858. Although the counties in central Illinois constituted the primary competition\n                  ground for both Lincoln and Douglas given that the Republican Party dominated the\n                  state’s northern counties and the Democratic Party dominated the southern counties,\n                  both men only traveled throughChristian Countyon their way to other appointments during the campaign. Lincoln traveled through\n                  Christian County in late-August on his way from a speaking engagement inCarlinvilleto another engagement inClinton, Illinois, and Douglas passed through Christian County in mid-October while traveling from\n                  Gillespie, Illinois toDecatur, Illinois.Montgomery County was in the Twentieth Illinois House of Representatives District,\n                  along with Christian County. In the local elections of 1858, James M. Davis won the\n                  district’s seat in the Illinois House. Republican Joseph Gillespie was up for reelection\n                  to the Twenty-First Illinois Senate district’s seat, but lost toSamuel A. Buckmaster. Christian County was  in the Sixteenth Illinois Senate district, along with Champaign,\n                  DeWitt, McLean, Macon, Moultrie, Piatt, and Shelby counties. Incumbent pro-Douglas\n                  DemocratJoel S. Postretained the seat. Madison County was in the Fourteenth Illinois House district.\n                  DemocratsZephaniah B. JobandJoseph H. Slosswon the districts’ seats. Bond County was in the Thirteenth Illinois House district,\n                  along with Clinton County. Democrat Charles Holies won this district’s seat.Harris ultimately won reelection to the Illinois Sixth District’s seat in the U.S.\n                  House of Representatives, garnering 57.6 percent of the vote compared to 41.4 percent\n                  earned by Matheny, and less than 1 percent received by McConnell. However, Harris\n                  died soon after the election and never took office.In the end, in the races for theIllinois General Assembly, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in the state, yet pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Davis, Buckmaster,\n                  Post, Job, Sloss, and Holies all cast their ballots for Douglas. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 8 September 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-08; 9 September 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-09; 11 September 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-11; Report of Speech at Edwardsville, Illinois;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 7 July 1858, 2:1; 24 September 1858, 2:3;Abraham Lincoln to Joseph Gillespie;Abraham Lincoln to Gustave P.
