        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote the entries in this document. Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, gave this document a tentative date of 1851, but without attribution.  Lincoln made\n                  entries in another genealogicalrecordrelated to the Lincoln family, which  is thought to have been created on either May\n                  17 or 18, 1851—the time frame within which Lincoln visited his stepmother,Sarah Lincoln, inCharleston, Illinois. The editors therefore concur with Basler’s assessment that this document was also\n                  created sometime in 1851, and most likely on either May 17th or 18th of that year.Roy P. Basler, ed.,The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 2:94-96;The History of Coles County, Illinois(Chicago: Wm.
