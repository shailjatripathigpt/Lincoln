        "text": "2Lincoln enclosed this letter with anotherletterhe wrote to George W. Rives on December 15, 1849, in which he explained his initial\n                  hesitancy to pen this letter of recommendation.In April 1849, Rives hadaskedLincoln to recommend him for a patronage position in theMinnesota Territory, or, failing that, for some position inCalifornia. Lincolnrepliedthat he was unable to provide Rives a letter, as he had already recommendedAnson G. Henryfor appointment in Minnesota and did not want to decrease Henry’s chances for success\n                  by recommending another party for a position in the same territory. Rives was apparently\n                  upset by Lincoln’s refusal, and, as Lincoln noted in his other December 15, 1849letterto Rives, Lincoln later learned that Rives engaged in “open abuse” of him in the\n                  summer of 1849.Rives’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents of\n                  the government for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so apparently he did not receive an appointment.Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849);Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853)."
