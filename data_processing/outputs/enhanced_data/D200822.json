He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to his political\n                  allies seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

Lincoln would be a leading\n                  contender when the General Assembly met in joint session on February 8, 1855, to select\n                  a U.S. senator, but the General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. See the1854 Federal Election.  Gage voted for Lincoln in the first eight ballots,   but in the ninth round he\n                  switched his support to Trumbull.  In the first two rounds of voting, Thomas J. Turner\n                  cast his vote for Lincoln. Turner cast no votes in the third through the ninth rounds\n                  of balloting, however, rejoined the voting in the tenth and final round to cast his\n                  ballot for Trumbull.  Other senators and representatives from Illinois’ First Congressional\n                  District supported Lincoln through the first three ballots, but began switching their\n                  votes to Trumbull,Martin P.
