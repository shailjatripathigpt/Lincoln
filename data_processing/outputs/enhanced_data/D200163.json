He said that he, for one, would not agree to\n\nstand up to any such compromise, as that made by his predecessors, in regard to supporting\n\ntheInternal Improvement systemon condition of removing the public offices toSpringfield;3but that the plan ofcompromiseought to be sacrificed, whenever the interests of theStateare likely to suffer injury by it. He said, that if classification were clearly\n\nadvisable, he would give his influence, were it necessary, to throw the northernCross Railroadinto the second class.4 MrThorntonsaid that he would meet the gentleman on this ground; and if he (MrB.) would take that course, he (MrT.) would use his influence in throwing the Altrn and Terre Haute Railroad also into\n\nthe second class.5 MrLincolnadmitted thatSangamon countyhad received great and important benefits, at the last session of theLegislature, in return for giving support, thro’ her delegation to thesystem of Internal Improvement; and that though notlegallybound, she ismorallybound, to adhere to thatsystem, through all time to come! MrHardinscouted the idea that the people are bound by the acts ofbargain and sale, which their Representatives may have made out of doors; and inveighed, with much\n\nseverity, against the delay which the inquiries propounded early in the session, in\n\nregard to classifying and reducing the public works, had met with from the friends\n\nof thesystem. He replied, in detail, to the arguments of his opponents and argued that thesystemcannot possibly be sustained without resorting to direct taxation; and this the people\n\ncould not, and would not bear. He said that the promises of its early advocates had\n\nall failed, and their fair visions had all vanished; and that nothing was now left,\n\nbut an empty treasury, and prospects of bankruptcy, if we go on with the present extravagantsystem.

        "text": "4By the winter of 1838-39, concern was growing over the size, scope, and cost of theinternal improvement system. In hisannual messageto theGeneral Assemblyin December 1838, GovernorThomas Carlinvoiced his support for the system, though he would have recommended its adoption\n                  on a lesser scale, with emphasis on constructing the most important works. Carlin\n                  suggested the General Assembly consider “modification” that would render the system\n                  “more useful and better suited to the conditions” of the state, leading the Sangamo\n                  Journal to wonder if by “modification” the governor meant “curtailment or classification.”\n                  Classification in this context might have meant differentiating between important\n                  and lesser projects and concentrating first on the former instead of pursuing all\n                  of the provisions of theinternal improvement actat the same time. Whatever course the General Assembly pursued, Carlin recommended\n                  “a rigid economy” in spending state funds.John H.
