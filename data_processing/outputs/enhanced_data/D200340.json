The authors of the broadside argued that if the seat was moved, the twenty acres\n                  in Tremont that had been deeded for the courthouse would revert back to its previous\n                  owner, John H. Harris.Anotherversion of the broadside exists which is slightly different; however, the text of\n                  Lincoln’s letter is the same on both. No handwritten version of the letter has been\n                  located, nor has the recipient of the letter been identified. The text of the broadside\n                  identifies the date of the letter as July 31, 1843."
