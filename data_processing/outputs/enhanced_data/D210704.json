        "text": "2Smith is referencing the Third Congressional District of Illinois, of which his home\n                  county ofVermilionwas a part, and where Owen Lovejoy was up for reelection to theU.S. House of Representativesin theelection of 1858. Some of the more conservative Republicans of the district sought to replace Lovejoy,\n                  whom they labeled an abolitionist. Among those who opposed Lovejoy’s reelection were\n                  Lincoln’s friends and alliesDavid Davis,Leonard Swett,T. Lyle Dickey, andWard H. Lamon. Lincoln, however, recognized the importance of Lovejoy’s supporters to his own ambition\n                  to be elected to the U.S. Senate, and had himselfwarnedLovejoy as early as March 1858 to be wary of the possibility of Democrats recruiting\n                  a Republican to run against him. Attempts from conservative Republicans and Democrats\n                  to either replace Lovejoy as the Republican candidate or challenge him with an independent\n                  opponent continued to be a concern throughout the campaign of 1858. Despite these\n                  efforts, Lovejoy was unanimously nominated for reelection at the district Republican\n                  convention  inJolieton June 30, and was returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1858 with 57.7\n                  percent of the vote, defeating Douglas Democrat George W. Armstrong who garnered 38.8 percent andBuchananDemocrat David Le Roy who received 3.4 percent.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.

When the General Assembly met in joint session on February 8, 1855 to elect the\n                  state’s next U.S. senator, Lincoln received a plurality of votes in the first two\n                  ballots. Fiveanti-NebraskaDemocrats, however, refused to vote for him or for a Douglas Democrat, and instead\n                  backed their fellow anti-Nebraska Democrat Trumbull. Several more rounds of voting\n                  ensued, but after nine rounds of voting no candidate had achieved a majority and DemocratJoel A. Mattesonhad the highest number of votes. At this juncture,  Lincoln urged his remaining supporters\n                  to vote for Trumbull to ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate won the seat. In the\n                  tenth round of voting Trumbull received a majority of votes and was declared the winner.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.

        "text": "5Because the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives to the U.S.\n                  Senate, the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewould be of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both campaigned\n                  extensively in 1858 and focused their efforts on the former Whig stronghold of central\n                  Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.  Among the former Whigs\n                  whose votes were courted were those who had moved into theAmerican Partyfollowing the dissolution of the Whig Party.While Vermilion County was considered to be safely Republican in the 1858 election,\n                  neighboring Edgar County was one of the former “Whig belt” counties that was important\n                  to securing a Republican majority in the General Assembly. Despite Smith’s fears,\n                  the Eighteenth Illinois Senate District, which includedColes,Cumberland, Edgar, and Vermilion counties, and the Twenty-Fourth Illinois House District, which\n                  was contiguous with Edgar County, both returned Republicans to the General Assembly\n                  in 1858. In the Eighteenth Illinois Senate District, RepublicanThomas A. Marshall, formerly a Whig, defeated DemocratUsher F. Linder. In the Twenty-Fourth Illinois House District, Republicans nominatedRobert Moseley, also a former Whig, as their candidate at a September 1858 convention at which it\n                  was said that “The utmost harmony and good feeling prevailed.” Moseley earned 1,453\n                  votes and defeated DemocratCharles Summers, who received 1,400 votes. When the election for U.S. senator was held in the General\n                  Assembly in January 1859, both Marshall and Moseley voted for Lincoln. While Lincoln\n                  received forty-six votes in the General Assembly, Douglas received fifty-one votes\n                  and retained the seat.Allen C.
