    "full_text": "John T. Stuart, Abraham Lincoln, and Benjamin S. Edwards to Robert Smith, 1 March\n\n18641 We herewith send you our answer to the questions propounded in yourletterof the 24th February, 1854.2 First. Is thecorporationlegally formed? The articles of association filed in the office of the Secretary of State, establish\n\nthe length of theroadat one hundred and sixty miles or thereabouts. They also show subscriptions to an\n\namount in the aggregate less than forty thousand dollars. With the articles and endorsed\n\nthereon or annexed thereto, is filed the affidavit of three persons, named in said\n\narticles as Directors, stating that the ‘amount of stock necessary for the incorporation\n\nof said company has been subscribed, viz;one hundred and sixty thousand dollars, and that ten per cent. on the amount, viz: sixteen thousand dollars, has been actually paid in as required\n\nby law.’ The date of this certificate is August 7, 1850. It is, we think, undoubted law, that such associations are confined to the provisions\n\nof the act authorizing them, and cannot be organized until all its substantial enactments\n\non the subject are complied with. See the case of ‘Valk vs. Crandall and others’—\n\n1st Sanford’s Ch. Rep. p. 179.3The substantial provisions of the act of Nov. 5, 1849, preliminary to the incor-<Page 2>poration of thecompany, are contained in the first and second sections of the act. The language is explicit,\n\n‘That any number of persons not less than twenty-five, beingsubscribersto the stock of any contemplated railroad may be formed into acorporationfor the purpose of constructing, owning and maintaining such railroadby complying with the following requirements.’ When stock to the amount of at least one thousand dollars for every mile of said\n\nroad so intended to be built, shall be in good faith subscribed, and ten per cent. paid thereon as herein required,then the said subscribersmay elect Directors for the said company,thereuponthey shall severally subscribe articles of association, &c. ‘Each subscriber to such articles of association shall subscribe thereto his name,\n\nplace of residence, and the number of shares of stock taken by him in such company.\n\nThesaidarticles of association may, on complying with the next section, be filed in the\n\noffice of Secretary of State, and thereupon the persons who have subscribed, and all\n\npersons who shall from time to time become stockholders in such company, shall be\n\na body corporate by the names specified in such articles.’4 ‘Sec. 3. Such articles of association shall not be filed in the office of the Secretary\n\nof State, until ten per cent. on the amount of stock subscribed thereto, shall have been actually and in good faith\n\npaid in cash to the Directors named in such articles, nor until there is endorsed\n\nthereon, or annexed thereto, an affidavit made by at least three of the Directors\n\nnamed in such articles, that the amount of stock required by the first section has\n\nbeen subscribed, and that ten per cent. on the amount has actually been paid in.’ We cannot doubt that the obvious intention of theLegislaturewas to require that all the preliminary steps to the incorporation of the company\n\nmust appear on the face of the papers filed in the Secretary’s office. The manifest\n\npropriety of such a requisition as security to the public against the formation of\n\nfictitious and irresponsible corporations, would of itself constitute a sufficient\n\nreason for this construction. The minuteness of detail contained in these sections\n\nis inconsistent with any other. Why such precision in these requirements, and the<Page 3>further requisition that these articles should be filed in the office of the Secretary,\n\nif not for the very purpose of manifesting the compliance with the provisions of the\n\nact? We think that the subscription of the amount prescribed by the first section\n\nmust be antecedent to the formation either of a company or the corporation. Until\n\nthis amount has been subscribed and the ten per cent. paid, thearticles of associationcannot be legally entered into. The language is:Whenstock to the amount required shall be in good faith subscribed and the ten per cent. paid, ‘thenthesaid subscribersmay elect directors for said company;thereuponthey shall severally subscribe articles of association.’5Now, who are to subscribe these articles? Clearly, those who have subscribed the\n\namount previously ascertained by the act, and have paid the per centage. These, and these only, are thesaid subscriberswhomay elect directors, the names of whom are to appear in the articles. Until the amount required is subscribed,\n\nno election of directors is authorized. Any persons elected directors by any number\n\nof subscribers prior to that event, would be illegally elected, and their certificate\n\nor affidavit would, so far as compliance with this act is concerned, be of no more\n\nlegal validity than the statement of persons nowise connected with the company. This view is corroborated by the 3d section of the act, which makes a certified copy\n\nof ‘any articles of association filed in pursuance of this act with a copy of the\n\naffidavit aforesaid endorsed thereon presumptive evidence of the incorporation of\n\nsaid company.’ Being onlypresumptiveevidence, even if every thing required appeared on the face of the papers, the truthfulness of the statements contained\n\nin them might be controverted. Surely it was not intended that a copy of articles\n\nshowing only a subscription of a part of the amount required, should be presumptive\n\nevidence of the subscription of the whole. And here we can see no reason for requiring\n\nan affidavit. The law requires the subscription to be made ingood faith. The names of subscribers, if genuine, with the amount of their subscription, would\n\nshow the liability of each, and afford the means of ascertaining the aggregate amount.\n\nThe affidavit would make theprima facieevidence of the genuineness of the signatures,<Page 4>thegood faithof the subscriptions, and the payment of the ten per cent.. Two essential guaranties are thus afforded for the construction or honestly attempted construction of thecontemplated road, viz; The personal responsibility of the subscribers, as provided in the 14th section\n\nof the act, and the affidavit of three directors to the good faith of the subscription\n\nand the payment of the instalment; and these, the articles subscribed as required, and the affidavit, constitute the\n\npresumptive evidence of incorporation. The one was not intended as a substitute for\n\nthe other. The company could no more be organized without the subscriptions appearing\n\non the articles than without the affidavit, and vice versa. We think that the only subscriptions which would in any event be obligatory, are\n\nthose which appear on the articles, or are subscribed on the books opened by the Commissioners.\n\nNow by reference to the 5th section it will be seen, that the commissioners are only\n\nauthorized to open books, ‘from time to timeafter the company shall be incorporated.’ Such subscriptions cannot supply the place of those which by the terms of the law\n\nare required to be made anterior, and as a condition precedent to the incorporation\n\nof the company. Without further extending the argument, we are clearly of opinion\n\nthat the association called ‘The Atlantic and Mississippi Railroad Company’ is not\n\na corporation legally formed, ‘under the act to provide for a general system of railroad\n\nincorporations,’ approved November 5, 1849. Second. Have they such an organization as entitles them to come before the present session\n\nof the Legislature? We think not. By the tenth section of the fourth article of\n\nthe constitution the Governor ‘may on extraordinary occasions convene the general\n\nassembly by proclamation, and shall state in said proclamation the purpose for which\n\nthey are to convene, and the general assembly shall enter on no legislative business\n\nexcept that for which they are specially called together.’ The proclamation which is thus made the exclusive grant of legislative power at this\n\nsession— which cannot constitutionally be transcended— is, so far as relates to this\n\nsubject, in these words: ‘To pass laws recognizing theexistence of, and con-<Page 5>ferring additional powers uponcorporations formed, or which may be formed prior to the action of the legislature thereon, under the\n\nact to provide for a general system of railroad incorporation’— approved Nov. 5, 1849— ‘declare the public utility of their works, sanction the routes and termini\n\nthereof, and authorize the construction of the same.’ This language is plain and the\n\nmeaning apparent. It is, not to recognize the existence of, and confer additional\n\npowers onassociations, butcorporations formedunder the act— not companies whose organization had not been completed, but those\n\nwho, by complying with the requirements of the general law have perfected their organization\n\nthereunder, so far as that could be done anterior to the legislation which is required\n\nby that law. It is apparent that theGovernorhad in contemplation the twenty-second section of the act containing provisions for\n\nthose acts of the Legislature necessary to clothe the corporation with all the powers\n\nconferred by the act; and particularly to the last clause of that section, ‘And the\n\nLegislature reserve (the right) to itself to indicate the routes and termini of said\n\nroads, and the same shall not be constructed and commenced without the express sanction\n\nof the Legislature of this state by a law to be passed thereafter.’ It was intended\n\nthat the assembly might situnderthe law of ‘49, but not that they might legislate in direct conflict with its provisions.6 The answers to the remaining questions, are we think, necessarily involved in what\n\nwe have already stated.7If we are correct in these opinions, then it follows, thatthe Atlantic and Mississippi Railroad Company has no legal existence as a corporation—\n\nthat the law of this session being beyond the power of the Legislature at a called\n\nsession to pass, is a nullity; that no bonds could be issued, nor collections of subscriptions\n\nbe enforced by a so called corporation which had no legal existence. As all subscriptions must be supposed to have been made with reference to an organization\n\nunder the general law, they would only be payable to acorporationlegally formed under that law— while all who subscribed to the articles of association,\n\nmay be presumed to have known that action of the Legislature according to the general\n\nlaw of Nov. 5, 1849, would be applied,<Page 6>for they will not we think, be presumed to have understood that such application\n\nwould be made until all the prerequisites of that law had been complied with. All\n\nsubscriptions, prior to the filing of the articles must, in our opinion, have been\n\nmade with the implied or express understanding that the full amount required by the\n\nlaw would be bona fide subscribed, and the per centage paid, and until that event, they would not be bound. We do not think that by the\n\nmere act of subscription they assented to the filing of the articles before the one\n\nhundred and sixty thousand dollars had been legally subscribed. Those who subscribed\n\nafter the alleged formation of theCompanyby the filing of the articles, will be presumed to have so subscribed with the understanding,\n\nthat all the requisitions of the act had been complied with, and the articles of association\n\nhad been legally filed in the office of the Secretary, and if this has not been done\n\nthey would not be bound to pay their subscriptions.8",

The manifest\n               propriety of such a requisition as security to the public against the formation of\n               fictitious and irresponsible corporations, would of itself constitute a sufficient\n               reason for this construction.  The minuteness of detail contained in these sections\n               is inconsistent with any other.  Why such precision in these requirements, and the<Page 3>further requisition that these articles should be filed in the office of the Secretary,\n               if not for the very purpose of manifesting the compliance with the provisions of the\n               act?  We think that the subscription of the amount prescribed by the first section\n               must be antecedent to the formation either of a company or the corporation.  Until\n               this amount has been subscribed and the ten per cent. paid, thearticles of associationcannot be legally entered into.  The language is:Whenstock to the amount required shall be in good faith subscribed and the ten per cent. paid, ‘thenthesaid subscribersmay elect directors for said company;thereuponthey shall severally subscribe articles of association.’5Now, who are to subscribe these articles?  Clearly, those who have subscribed the\n               amount previously ascertained by the act, and have paid the per centage.  These, and these only, are thesaid subscriberswhomay elect directors, the names of whom are to appear in the articles.  Until the amount required is subscribed,\n               no election of directors is authorized.  Any persons elected directors by any number\n               of subscribers prior to that event, would be illegally elected, and their certificate\n               or affidavit would, so far as compliance with this act is concerned, be of no more\n               legal validity than the statement of persons nowise connected with the company."

Surely it was not intended that a copy of articles\n               showing only a subscription of a part of the amount required, should be presumptive\n               evidence of the subscription of the whole.  And here we can see no reason for requiring\n               an affidavit.  The law requires the subscription to be made ingood faith.  The names of subscribers, if  genuine, with the amount of their subscription, would\n               show the liability of each, and afford the means of ascertaining the aggregate amount.\n               The affidavit would make theprima facieevidence of the genuineness of the signatures,<Page 4>thegood faithof the subscriptions, and the payment of the ten per cent..  Two essential guaranties are thus afforded for the construction or honestly attempted construction of thecontemplated road, viz; The personal responsibility of the subscribers, as provided in the 14th section\n               of the act, and the affidavit of three directors to the good faith of the subscription\n               and the payment of the instalment; and these, the articles subscribed as required, and the affidavit, constitute the\n               presumptive evidence of incorporation.  The one was not intended as a substitute for\n               the other.
