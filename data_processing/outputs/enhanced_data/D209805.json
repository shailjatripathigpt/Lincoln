        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln sent Ewing atelegramon November 17, 1849, recommendingSimeon Francisfor appointment as surveyor general of theOregon Territory. However, the first person appointed to this position was John B. Preston, who was\n                  appointed by PresidentMillard Fillmore.Prior to recommending Francis for this position Lincoln had recommended him for secretary\n                  of the Oregon Territory, a position PresidentZachary Taylorawarded Lincoln on August 9, 1849, but which Lincoln declined. OtherIllinoisWhigsalso pressed for Francis to receive the secretary appointment, but Taylor ultimately\n                  appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory.Francis’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did\n                  not receive any other appointment during this period. The 1861 official register shows\n                  Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment either, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Appointment of Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Territory of Oregon;Abraham Lincoln to John M.
