Judd and Ebenezer Peck in\n                  the letter from Judd which Lincoln had just received.From July 1856 onwards Lincoln gave over fifty speeches acrossIllinoisin support of Republican presidential candidateJohn C.

The Republican\n                  campaign in Maine was also supported by speakers from New Hampshire,Connecticut,New York, andMassachusetts, as the newly-formed party there attempted to make an impression. Despite the strenuous\n                  efforts of the nascent Maine Republican Party, they lost control of the state legislature\n                  in the election. They also failed to secure the governorship. None of the gubernatorial\n                  candidates won an outright majority of the vote, so the selection of governor devolved\n                  to the state legislature, which selectedDemocratSamuel Wells as the winner.In the New Hampshire election in the spring of 1856, Democratic presidentFranklin Pierceprevailed upon prominent Democrats from South Carolina andGeorgiato campaign for the party in his home state. The effort backfired as the states’\n                  rights message of the southern Democrats failed to appeal to New Hampshire Democrats.\n                  After no candidate in the gubernatorial race won a majority of the votes, the New\n                  Hampshire General Court selectedAmerican Partycandidate Ralph Metcalf as the winner.H.

        "text": "6No response from Grimes to this letter has been located.Judd and Peck had informed Lincoln in their letter that they intended to also write to Orville H. Browning in regards to the Iowa campaign.\n                  Browning gave speeches at a Republican meeting inKeokuk, inLee County, on July 31 and August 1, 1856, and appeared inBurlington, inDes Moines County, on August 2, 1856 but was so hoarse from the previous two days of speaking thatJohn Wentworthgave a speech in his place. Iowa held elections for state legislature and forU.S. Congresson August 4. Browning recorded that although the Democratic Party had expected to\n                  carry Des Moines County, the Republican ticket come out ahead by 50 to 100 votes in\n                  the county. Ultimately, both men elected to the U.S. Congress in Iowa in 1856 were\n                  Republicans and the party gained control of the state legislature and all departments\n                  of the state government.The Republicans did not, however, fare so well in the presidential election in Lee\n                  and Des Moines counties  in November 1856. Despite Browning’s efforts, Democratic\n                  presidential candidateJames Buchananearned the most votes inLeeandDes Moinescounties. In Lee County, Buchanan garnered 47.0 percent of the vote, with Fremont\n                  winning 38.8 percent and American Party candidateMillard Fillmoreearning 14.2 percent. The race was closer in Des Moines County, with Buchanan receiving\n                  43.2 percent of the vote, Fremont earning 40.9 percent, and Fillmore garnering 15.9\n                  percent. Overall in Iowa, Fremont received the most votes, but Buchanan ultimately\n                  won the presidency.Theodore Calvin Pease and James G.
