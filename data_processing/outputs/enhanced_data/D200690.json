Eventually,\n                  the word became synonymous with deeds, and particularly to real property transaction\n                  deeds in which both parties assumed obligations, which is the context within which\n                  the word is used here.“Indenture,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

        "text": "3As in modern times, conveying or transferring realty to someone with $1.00 listed\n                  as the amount of consideration on the deed was a common way of indicating that the\n                  transfer was a gift rather than a sale. Hence, this was a deed of gift, in which Abraham\n                  and Mary Lincoln gifted the land that Lincoln  inherited from his father to John D.\n                  Johnston, Lincoln’s stepbrother. Since no correspondence between Lincoln and Johnston\n                  regarding this gift of land has been located, it’s unclear if Lincoln agreed to this\n                  transfer on the basis of any arrangements or factors beyond what is specified in this\n                  deed.1941 Supplement to the Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America(Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1943), 2:2370."
