        "text": "3During their convention in June 1852, theWhig Partynominated Winfield Scott as their candidate for president andWilliam A. Grahamas their candidate for vice-president in thepresidential election of 1852, hoping that a Scott-Graham ticket would enable the party to remain bisectional and\n                  appealing to both Northern and Southern Whigs. Scott was the favorite candidate of\n                  most Northern Whigs, and Graham was a slaveholder fromNorth Carolina. Ultimately, although many Southern Whigs were pleased with Graham’s nomination,\n                  they were far less enthusiastic about Scott. The contest was fairly close in Ohio:\n                  the totalDemocraticvote was 169,193, the Whigs garnered 152,577 votes, and theFree Soil Partyreceived another 31,133 votes. Yet the  Whig Party suffered a devastating defeat\n                  on the national stage. The Democratic Party’s candidate,Franklin Pierce, won 254 electoral votes to Scott’s 42.Michael F.
