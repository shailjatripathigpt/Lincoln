MessrsMinshallandGillespie, briefly objected to the phraseology of the amendment, by which they were required\n\n“to go home,”nolens volens, when they might perhaps wish to take an excursion elsewhere.4 MrPECKwas sorry to see gentlemen on the other side so afraid of going home and returning\n\nto their constituents: under these circumstance he hoped they would consent to stay\n\nuntil the business was got through. He never saw any good result from fixing a day\n\nfor adjournment; it was our first business to do what we were sent here to do. As\n\nthe gentlemen were not anxious to go home, he hoped they would not force others home\n\nby voting for an adjournment, before the business was got through. Mr. HARDIN complained of the alleged delays of the committee of Finance. Mr PECK explained that there was a parliamentary mode of compelling committees to\n\nreport, by making a motion to that effect: the committee had not yet been able to\n\nagree on a report, notwithstanding it had been incessantly employed day and night.5 MrMcCLERNANDbore testimony to the diligence and activity of thechairmanFi of-nance (mr Peck. ) If thegentlemanfromMorganwas so anxious to advance the public busness, why did he absent himself from the business of the House. He had been frequently\n\nabsent; he had even been to enjoy himself at home, while thechairman of the Finance committeehad never absented himself one day from the House, no, nor even one hour. After\n\nsome further remarks, Mr. McC. moved to strike out the words “forthwith go home;” which, after a brief exchange\n\nof pleasantry between him andmr Gillespie, was agreed to. mr.HENDERSONmoved to lay the amendment, as amended, on the table, as it had now neither beginning,\n\nend, nor middle, and merely said “we will do the business of the House,” which would\n\nseem to imply that hitherto we had not attended to it.6 The motion was then carried, and the amendment laid on the table. The question being on the adoption of the original resolution, mrCAVARLYspoke against the proposition to fix a time to adjourn, whether business should\n\nbe completed or not; and deprecated the practice of consuming the time of theHouseby bringing forward and debating resolutions for the purpose of giving the appearance\n\nat home of a zeal for short sessions. Mr. WHEELER offered to amend by adding that night sessions be held.7 Mr. HARDIN moved to lay the amendment on the table, which was agreed to. mr. CAVARLY moved to lay the original resolution on the table; which was lost—ayes\n\n42, noes 45. mr. CARPENTER then moved to amend by striking out 22nd February, and inserting March\n\n1st. Mr.PARSONSmade the calculation that those resolutions had, by the delay and loss of time and\n\nlong discussions they had occasioned, cost each one of them at least two thousand\n\ndollars to theState. Mr P was opposed to being driven home by theopposite partybefore the business was finished. MrLINCOLNdenied that thispartyhad attempted to delay any measure brought forward by theother party. mr.Hardincontended that these resolutions came from theDemocratic party. Mr.Carpenterrose to move the previous question. Mr.MURPHY, ofPerry, urged that the main object of all the resolutions was “Bunkum.” Mr M then proeeeded to shew the necessity of completing the business of the country, and then, and not till then,\n\nadjourning. The discussion was further continued by Messrs.Brown, ofVermillion, Peck, andWebb. Mr CARPENTER moved the previous question, which motion pending, Thehouse adjourned.",

Cavarly,Albert G. Leary, Edwin B. Webb,Lyman Trumbull,John Dougherty,Stephen G. Hicks, andThomas Drummond.GovernorThomas Carlinhad called for the opening of the Twelfth General Assembly on November 23, 1840,\n                  two weeks before the constitutionally-mandated date for the regular session, in order\n                  to deal with the state debt crisis. Particularly vexing was that the state had no\n                  funds in the treasury to satisfy the interest payment on the debt due January 1, 1841.The Democrats and Whigs in the House of Representatives already had an ugly confrontation\n                  over attempts to adjournsine dieduring this special session.  In December 1839, the state’s debt crisis forced theState Bank of Illinoisto suspend specie payments for a second time.  The bank’sincorporation actand anact supplementarygave the bank sixty days to resume specie payments or forfeit its charter.  On January\n                  31, 1840, theGeneral Assemblypassed anactsuspending stipulations on specie payments until the end of the next legislative\n                  session. On December 5, 1840,  the Whigs, hoping to protect the bank against Democrat\n                  demands that it resume specie payments by the end of the special session or forfeit\n                  its charter, boycotted the General Assembly, thereby preventing the necessary two-thirds\n                  quorum for adjournmentsine die.  When the situation became acute, Abraham Lincoln, Joseph Gillespie, andAsahel Gridley, occupying their seats  as a token representation of Whigs for procedural votes,\n                  exited the House chamber through windows to prevent a quorum and frustrate plans of\n                  the Democrats.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G.
