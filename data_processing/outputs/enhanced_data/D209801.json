        "text": "2Abraham LincolnwroteEwing the same day as this letter, requesting  all letters of recommendation in support\n                  of his candidacy for commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office that theU.S. Department of the Interiorhad in its possession. Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. Supporters of each candidate\n                  sent letters of reference and recommendation to both PresidentZachary Taylorand Secretary of the Interior Ewing. Although the Department of the Interior oversaw\n                  the U.S. General Land Office, President Taylor was ultimately responsible for appointing\n                  the commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office.Lincoln and Ewing were able to correspond quickly at the time of this letter because\n                  Lincoln was in Washington, DC. As competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, had urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. Lincoln arrived on or before June 19.\n                  Ewing and Lincoln corresponded several more times on the topic of letters of recommendation\n                  Ewing and the Department of the Interior received concerning Lincoln’s candidacy for\n                  commissioner. Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment;\n                  the job went to Butterfield instead.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Lincoln laterwroteEwing that he waited until July 8th before opening this package of letters, then\n                  found the letters ofRichard W. ThompsonandElisha Embreemissing. Lincoln suspected that  these two particular letters were purposefully omitted\n                  by someone at the Department of the Interior in order to give Butterfield an advantage\n                  over him in the competition for the job. Ewing, however, insisted that President Taylor\n                  had seen both Thompson’s and Embree’s letters, after which they were then forwarded\n                  to him and retained due to departmental policy which did not permit the return of\n                  any letters of reference or recommendation which were addressed to Taylor or which\n                  contained statements about anyone other than the person being recommended. Lincoln\n                  laterwroteJohn Addisonthat his loyalty to both Taylor and “the greatwhigcause” induced him to remain silent about his suspicions. Thompson’s and Embree’s\n                  letters of recommendation have not been located.Eventually, on April 22, 1850, theDemocrat-controlledU.S. House of Representativesformed a committee underWilliam A. Richardsonto investigate Ewing’s role in and handling of patronage appointments as well as\n                  his management of pension payments and Department of the Interior accounts. On June\n                  8, 1850, theNew York Heraldreported that Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office was one patronage appointment that the Richardson Committee was investigating,\n                  particularly with regard to letters missing from the file on Lincoln that was shown\n                  to President Taylor prior to Taylor selecting the final appointee. However, when the\n                  committee filed its final reports on September 4-7, 1850, it made no finding regarding\n                  Butterfield’s appointment. The Whig-controlledU.S. Senatealso exonerated Ewing of all charges, although suspicions remained in some Whig circles\n                  that Ewing had indeed suppressed letters of recommendation from Lincoln’s  file.William H.
