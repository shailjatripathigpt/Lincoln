Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln,  placed the entire letter, of which this fragment is the last page, in 1849, resting\n                  on the assumption that Lincoln wrote it during the competition for patronage that\n                  followed the inauguration of Zachary Taylor as president.  Lincoln’s and Baker’s other\n                  joint correspondence during this period offers ample evidence for Basler’s conjecture,\n                  and the editors have retained Basler’s date.Roy P.
