Abraham Lincoln\n                  entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison\n                  and Edwards. As competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah M. Lucas, Lincoln supporters living inWashington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s capital to personally lobby for the position.\n                  On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19.

At the end of the first session of the\n                  Thirtieth Congress, Lincoln spent eleven days inMassachusettsstumping for Taylor to win the presidential election of 1848.
