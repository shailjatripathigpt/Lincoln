        "text": "7Lincoln references a lawsuit involving Nathanial Sniffen and Lemuel Harris.  In 1848,\n                  Harris informed Sniffen, his father-in-law, about 230 acres of land that was for sale.\n                  Sniffen sent Harris $2,200 to buy the property and to obtain title to the land in\n                  Sniffen's name.  Harris and his wife visited Sniffen several years later, and Harris\n                  informed Sniffen that he had purchased the land in his own name.  Sniffen demanded\n                  a deed of conveyance, but Harris refused.  In October 1855, Sniffen retained Lincoln\n                  and sued Harris in theUnited States Circuit Court, Southern District of Illinois,  to convey the 230 acres. The case continued for several years, but when Sniffen\n                  failed to continue to prosecute the case, the court dismissed it in March 1862.Bill of Complaint, Document ID: 62950; Decree, Document ID: 62972,Sniffen v.
