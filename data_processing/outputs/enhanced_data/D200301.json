Beginning on  February\n                  1, 1842, Illinoisans could apply for bankruptcy relief in the U.S. District Court\n                  in Springfield. Logan & Lincoln participated in at least 72 bankruptcy cases during\n                  1842 and 1843. They filed bankruptcy petitions for debtors and their lawyers from\n                  throughout the state, including for Hawley, who resided in Dixon, Illinois. The court\n                  declared Hawley bankrupt, but it is unknown whether he was discharged of his debts.“An Act to Establish a Uniform System of Bankruptcy throughout the United States,”\n                     19 August 1841,Statutes at Large of the United States5 (1856):440-49;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 20 May 1842, 1:4; 15 July 1842, 3:5; Daniel W.
