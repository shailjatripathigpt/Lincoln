The crowd gathered to hear him was\n                  estimated to be between 1,000 and 1,800 attendees.Abraham Lincolnwas theRepublicancandidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to Douglas, theDemocratincumbent.
