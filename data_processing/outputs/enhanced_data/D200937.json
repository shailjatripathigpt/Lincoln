        "text": "6In state elections of 1856,DemocratMartin Shallenberger won the contest to represent Peoria andStarkcounties in the Illinois House, but Republicans contested the outcome.    Shallenberger\n                  garnered 3,067 votes and Calvin L. Eastman, his Republican opponent and nearest challenger,\n                  received 2,796 votes.  One “Calvin M. Eastman,” however, received 280 votes.  Republicans\n                  insisted that the typographical error cost Eastman the seat and argued that the 280\n                  votes were intended for Calvin L. Eastman.  In McDonough County, Democrat George Hire\n                  received a majority, but Republicans questioned his win on account of “a deficiency\n                  in a pole list.” Both Hire and Shallenberger took their seats at the start of the\n                  new session of the House on January 5, 1857.  According to theIllinois State Journal, the House thus comprised thirty-eight Democrats, thirty-one Republicans, and sixKnow-Nothings.  In February, the House rejected a resolution declaring Shallenberger not elected\n                  and his seat vacant.The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 December 1856, 1:1;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 5 January 1857, 2:2; 19 February 1857, 2:1; Illinois HouseJournal. 20th G.
