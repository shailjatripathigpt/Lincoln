Hasheever approved thePresident's conduct in the beginning of the war, or his mode or objects in prossecuting it? Never– He condemns both– True, he votes supplies, and so do I– What, then, is\n\nthe difference, except that he is a great man and I am a small one?4 Towards the close of your letter you ask three questions, the first of which is \"Would\n\nit not have been just as easy to have electedGenlTaylorwithout opposing the war as by opposing it?\"5I answer, I suppose it would, ifyou^we^could doneither—could besilenton the question; but theLocofocoshere will not let thewhigsbesilent– Their very first act incongresswas to present a preamble declaring that war existed by the act ofMexico, and the whigs were obliged to vote on it–6and this policy is followed up by them; so that they are compelled tospeakand their only option is whether they will, when they do speak, tell thetruth, or tell a foul, villainous, and bloody falsehood– But, while on this point, I protest\n\nagainst you calling the condemnation of<Page 2>Polk, \"opposing the war\"– In thus assuming that all must be opposed^to the war,^even though they vote supplies, who do not not endorse Polk, with due deference I say I think you fall into one of the artfully\n\nset traps ofLocofocoism– Your next question is \"And suppose we could succeed in proving it a wicked and unconstitutional\n\nwar, do we not thereby strip Taylor andScottof more than half their laurels?\" Whether it would so strip them is not matter of\n\ndemonstration, but ofopiniononly; and my opinion is that it would not; but as your opinion seems to be different,\n\nlet us call in some others as umpire– There are in thisH.

Including principally but not exclusively\n                  Southern Whigs, the Young Indians made it their goal to nominate Zachary Taylor as\n                  the Whig Party standard bearer in 1848.  Some Whigs condemned the movement for Taylor,\n                  a southern slaveholder who had no previous political affiliation, as an abandonment\n                  of Whig principles.  Taylor’s insistence on an independent candidacy, separate from\n                  party affiliation, further eroded his following among the party faithful, includingHenry Clay, the party’s standard bearer in the1844 electionand was still the nominal head of the party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:275-76; Holman Hamilton,Zachary Taylor: Soldier in the White House(Hamden, CT: Archon, 1966), 63-64; Michael F.
