This telegram has not been located. But, as Lincoln explained in aletterdated September 23, he asked a friend in Springfield to reply to Ewing immediately\n                  via telegraph declining the position. That friend did not telegraph Ewing as requested,\n                  fearing Lincoln was declining the position in haste. This led Ewing to send anothertelegramto Springfield on September 25 asking whether Lincoln was in Springfield to respond.\n                  Once Lincoln learned of this, he traveled back to Springfield, sent this telegram\n                  to Ewing himself, and wrote Ewing aletterexplaining this sequence of events.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 20 September 1849,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1849-09-20; 25 September 1849,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1849-09-25; Paul I.

        "text": "2Prior to offering Lincoln appointment as governor of the Oregon Territory, PresidentZachary Taylor’s administration had offered Lincoln appointment as secretary of the Oregon Territory,\n                  an appointment which Lincoln also declined but recommended Francis for instead. The\n                  administration offered Lincoln both positions soon after Taylor appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both  Taylor and Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln a political\n                  appointment in the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and\n                  prevent additional attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. Lincoln  seriously considered\n                  accepting the governorship of the Oregon Territory, but ultimately declined the position,\n                  at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.In the end, Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory. Francis’ name does not appear in the official\n                  registers of the officers and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,\n                  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did not receive any other appointment during this\n                  period. The 1861 official register shows Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment either, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Appointment of Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Territory of Oregon; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1855(Washington, DC: A.
