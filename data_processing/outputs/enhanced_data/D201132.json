        "text": "2Lincoln had been  Alexander Sympson’s guest inCarthage, Illinois, where he had given a speech on October 22, 1858. Lincoln was at this time running\n                  against incumbent senatorStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate, having been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionin June. With theRepublican Partydominating the northern part of Illinois, and the Democratic Party stronger in the\n                  southern part of the state, Lincoln and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts\n                  on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois where the electoral outcome was less certain. From\n                  Carthage, Lincoln had visited Fountain Green, Dallas City, andLa Harpeon October 23, 1858, making speeches in the latter two locations, then was inBlandinsvilleon or before October 24, when he wrote this letter. Sympson apparently accompanied\n                  Lincoln for a time after Lincoln departed from Carthage.

        "text": "3A rift had formed in the Democratic Party after Douglas criticized theLecompton Constitutionand PresidentJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857. In the Fifth Congressional District of Illinois\n                  Jacob C. Davis was running for election in 1858 as an independent Democrat, challenging\n                  incumbent DemocratIsaac N. Morris.  In this race Buchanan supporters, also known as National Democrats, were backing\n                  Davis, and Douglas supporters were backing Morris. Davis ultimately placed a distant\n                  third in the race, garnering just under 2 percent of the vote. Morris won reelection\n                  with 52.7 percent of the vote, and Republican candidateJackson Grimshawearned 45.4 percent.Lincoln is reporting a rumor thatHancock CountyDouglas Democrats George Edmunds, Jr. and Milton M. Morrill intended to propose the\n                  concession that Buchanan Democrats could support their candidate, Davis, in theU.S. House of Representativesrace in exchange for supporting Douglas Democrats in theIllinois General Assemblyraces. Such a deal among the Democrats of the Fifth Congressional District would\n                  be significant to Lincoln’s U.S. Senate campaign against Douglas, as the Illinois\n                  General Assembly elected the state’s representatives to the U.S. Senate at this time.\n                  Douglas Democrat candidates were ultimately successful in the Hancock County General\n                  Assembly races of 1858. In the Thirty-First District of theIllinois House of Representatives, which consisted solely of Hancock County,William H. Rooseveltwon election with 2,389 votes, defeating RepublicanGeorge Rockwellwho earned 2,032 votes, and Buchanan DemocratWilliam F. Frazeewho garnered 44 votes. Hancock,Henderson, andSchuylercounties constituted the EleventhIllinois SenateDistrict, whereJohn P. Richmondearned 4,578 votes and defeated RepublicanJohn C. Bagbywho received 4,112 votes, and Buchanan Democrat William C. Wagley who earned 207\n                  votes. Roosevelt and Richmond both voted for Douglas for U.S. Senate in theelection of 1858.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445-48; Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.

        "text": "4Among Illinois Republicans there was hope that the division in the Democratic Party\n                  in 1858, which resulted in competing Democratic candidates in some races, would improve\n                  the chances of Republican candidates. Although during the summer of 1858 Lincoln had\n                  denied knowledge of collusion between Republicans and Buchanan Democrats in Illinois,\n                  he is here calling for the Buchanan Democratic candidates for Illinois General Assembly\n                  in Hancock County, Wagley and Frazee,  to be notified of this rumored courting of\n                  their supporters by Douglas Democrats so that they could push back and thus maintain\n                  a divided Democratic vote to the benefit of Lincoln’s U.S. Senate campaign.On being informed of this letter later in life, Edmunds recollected that fearing for\n                  the election prospects of the Hancock County Douglas Democrat candidates for Illinois\n                  General Assembly in 1858 in light of the split in the party, he and Morrill had called\n                  a meeting at the county courthouse, which resulted in a Democratic Party convention\n                  “which was held and resulted so satisfactorily to the Democratic voters that we were\n                  able to elect Douglas Democrats to both Senate and House.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:455-56; Allen C.
