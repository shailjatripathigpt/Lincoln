        "text": "2Smith v. Gardnerwas an ejectment case that began trial at theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinoison January 20, 1852. In American law, “ejectment” relates to an action to recover\n                  land or other real property and to collect damages. Originally, in the English common\n                  law, only tenants could use this action to recover possession of land from which they\n                  had been unlawfully ousted. Because of the simplicity and swiftness of the ejectment\n                  procedure, landowners began to use this action to recover land. To do so, the landowner,\n                  on behalf of a fictitious tenant (John Doe), sued a fictitious defendant (Richard\n                  Roe) for ousting the fictitious tenant. The court titled such cases John Doe ex dem.\n                  “Landowner” v. Richard Roe. When the defendant appeared in court, the clerk sometimes\n                  replaced “Richard Roe” with the defendant’s real name.  In anactpassed in March 1839, theIllinois General Assemblyabolished the need for the fictitious names. The losing party in an ejectment case\n                  was entitled by law to one new trial simply by paying the court costs.Lincoln,Hezekiah M. Wead, and Orville H. Browning served as attorneys for the plaintiff, Spencer Smith, andStephen T. Loganserved as attorney for James Gardner, the defendant. At the heart of the suit was\n                  a dispute over Gardner’s occupation of 160 acres of land inFulton County, Illinois, land over which Smith claimed ownership and from which he wanted Gardner ejected.\n                  The original case was decided the same day Lincoln penned this letter to Browning—January\n                  26, 1852. JudgeThomas Drummondruled for Smith.Complete Record, Document ID: 68744,Smith v. Gardner, Martha L.

        "text": "3During the trial, Logan had attempted to argue that per the act of 1819 establishing\n                  the recorder’s office, Smith’s deed was fraudulent and void and that, therefore, Gardner’s\n                  deed from August 1820 took precedence over Smith’s deed and claim to the land. Section\n                  eight of the act of 1819 required all deeds and  conveyances of real estate to be\n                  recorded in the newly-created recorder’s office for the county in which the property\n                  in question was located, and declared any deeds or conveyances not recorded in this\n                  manner to be “fraudulent and void.”However, the court determined that Gardner’s deed of August 1820 did not take precedence\n                  over Smith’s deed of January 1820 because, despite being recorded “defectively” in\n                  June 1820, Smith’s deed was “cured,” or made official, by an act in 1822 concerning\n                  deeds. The act contained a section which declared that all deeds, mortgages, transfers,\n                  and conveyances of real estate originating outside the state ofIllinoiswere valid so long as they had  initially been created in accordance with the laws\n                  of the state or territory in which they originated. (In legal terminology, a conveyance\n                  refers to the transfer of property ownership between people by written instrument.\n                  It can also refer to the written instrument or document used to accomplish such a\n                  transfer.)“An Act Establishing the Recorder’s Office, and for Other Purposes,” 19 February 1819,Laws of Illinois(1819),      18, 20; “An Act Concerning Deeds Executed Without this State,” 30 December\n                     1822,Laws of Illinois(1822),      85-86; “Conveyance,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

Theactcontained several sections related to the collection of taxes on property which were\n                  relevant to the case. Lincoln, Wead, and Browning were likely most interested in sections\n                  seventeen and forty-three of theact, both of which contained guidelines related to the sale of property that an owner\n                  had failed to pay taxes on. Since, as Lincoln notes, theactrepealed all former laws on the subject, any purchase of the land in question due\n                  to non-payment of taxes in 1838—conducted under old legislation—was deemed a void\n                  sale by the court."
