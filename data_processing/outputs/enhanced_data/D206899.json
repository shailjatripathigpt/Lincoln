The author wrote, “Judge D. is a very fair man in his way, but has no more sympathy\n                  with the vitalizing principle of the Republican party  than an Egyptian mummy.” “Fair\n                  Play” also accused Davis of aspiring toward the seat occupied by Lovejoy.Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 4 June 1858, 2:3; Howard W.

        "text": "3Despite Lincoln's protestations, some Republicans hoped to block Lovejoy's renomination.\n                  Conservative Republicans, disgruntled with Lovejoy’sabolitionismand fearful of its impact on Republican candidates in state elections, planned to\n                  block Lovejoy's renomination at the district congressional convention.  Some of Lincoln’s\n                  friends—including Davis,T. Lyle Dickey,Ward H. Lamon, andLeonard Swett—supported this scheme, believing that Lincoln, who was the leading Republican candidate\n                  to unseatStephen A. Douglasas U.S. senator in the upcoming1858 Federal Election, could only succeed if Lovejoy was not re-nominated. Once hope of preventing Lovejoy's\n                  renomination vanished, Lamon and others pondered finding a independent candidate to\n                  challenge Lovejoy.  Lamon sought Lincoln's opinion, but the latter urged against it,\n                  arguing the fissure of the Republican Party into Lovejoy and anti-Lovejoy factions\n                  would likely result in aDemocraticvictory and hurt his chance of being elected to theU.S. Senate.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:456; Willard L.

When Lovejoy defeated Swett for the nomination, LincolnwroteDavis: “When I heard that Swett was beaten, and Lovejoy nominated, it turned me blind;”\n                  but due to the people’s support of Lovejoy, Lincoln concluded, “I really think it\n                  best to let the matter stand.”  Lincoln wrote asimilar lettertoHenry C.
