        "text": "2In his August 6letterto Lincoln, Alexander Sympson asked Lincoln to confirm whether he would be in Augusta,\n                  Illinois, on August 25 and promised to publicize Lincoln’s appearance if he came.\n                  Lincoln also wrote Sympson at least two additional letters related to the elections\n                  of 1858.TheRepublicansofIllinois’ Fifth Congressional District held their congressional convention in Augusta on August\n                  25, and Lincoln delivered an address in Augusta that day. At the time, Lincoln was\n                  running againstDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglasas the Illinois Republican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. During the summer and fall of 1858 he  crisscrossed the state, delivering speeches\n                  and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates. Because members of theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, the outcome of the races\n                  for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewas highly relevant to the1858 Federal Election. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.In the end, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois in the local\n                  elections that year, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular\n                  through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Abraham Lincoln to Alexander Sympson; Abraham Lincoln to Alexander Sympson; Howard W.
