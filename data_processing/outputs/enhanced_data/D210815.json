        "text": "2Davis is discussing potential candidates for the Thirty-Ninth Illinois House of Representatives\n                  District, which consisted entirely of Tazewell County. By early August, the Democrats\n                  of Tazewell County had identifiedRobert B. M. Wilsonas their candidate, not Squire W. D. Chace. When the Tazewell CountyRepublicanconvention was held inTremonton August 30, 1858, Richard N. Cullom was selected as that party’s candidate. Cullom\n                  ultimately received 1,783 votes in the election, losing to Wilson, who earned 1,955\n                  votes.Abraham Lincoln had been nominated in June at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the former Whig stronghold of central Illinois, where the state\n                  legislative races were the closest. Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted\n                  were those who had moved into theAmerican Partyfollowing the dissolution of the Whig Party.
