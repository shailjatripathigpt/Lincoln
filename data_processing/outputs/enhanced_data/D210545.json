Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. Ultimately, neither Morrison,\n                  Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job went to Butterfield instead.\n                  See theGeneral Land Office Affair."
