French immigrants settled inIllinoisearly in its history. At the founding of the United States, the land fell under federal\n                  control, and it became the role of federal officials to interpret local practice and\n                  French colonial land law to determine who owned proper titles to their land.  During\n                  theWar of 1812, American forces burnedPeoriaand displaced its French settlers. In 1820 and again in 1823,Congressoffered the French settlers claims to their former property. The land at the time\n                  had very little value, and many immigrants had moved away and did not accept the offer.\n                  However, land prices eventually increased, and by the 1830s and 1840s, surveyors made\n                  plats based on the French claims, resulting in disputes between original settlers\n                  and the current owners.  Article eleven of the 1848 Illinois Constitution specified\n                  that all land granted, as a common, to inhabitants of any town, village, hamlet, or\n                  corporation by an individual or government body would remain common to the inhabitants\n                  of said town, village, hamlet, or corporation forever.“An Act for the Relief of the Inhabitants of the Village of Peoria, in the State of\n                     Illinois,” 15 May 1820,Statutes at Large of the United States, 3 (1846):605; “An Act to Confirm Certain Claims to Lotts [Lots] in the Village of\n                     Peoria, in the State of Illinois,” 3 March 1823,Statutes at Large of the United States3 (1846):786-87; C.
