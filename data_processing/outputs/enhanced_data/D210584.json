Lincoln wrote several letters to political allies  in November and December of 1854,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats. When the votes were counted, he won election to the Illinois General Assembly.\n                  In late-November, however, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, he  did not win election\n                  to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Ruggles cast his vote for Lincoln until the ninth ballot, when he switched\n                  to Trumbull.

In September 1856, Snell motioned to dismiss the case, the court granted his motion,\n                  and JudgeDavid Davisordered Snell to pay all “costs and charges” that the defendants expended in their\n                  defense.
