(It is unclear if the couple were legally married). McKinley circulated a\n                  petition asking Governor William H. Bissell to pardon Jones on the basis of his otherwise\n                  good character. In a letter dated May 31, 1858, John H. Angle, a business owner inWest Urbana, wrote to Bissell to object to the idea of pardoning Jones. While Angle agreed that\n                  Jones’s “wife” was “a woman of decidedly bad character,” he also berated Jones as\n                  “notoriously a worthless fellow” with a poor reputation in the community.James B.

Angle speculated that many of the petitioners may have only\n                  signed because McKinley himself vouched for Jones’s character.
