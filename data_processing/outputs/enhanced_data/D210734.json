        "text": "2Wiggins is referring to the case ofWiggins Ferry Co. v. Steamer Ocean Spray. In the course of his employment by the Wiggins Ferry Company, ferry boat captain\n                  John Trendley had encountered the SteamerOcean Sprayon April 22, 1858, floating on theMississippi River, unoccupied and on fire. Trendley had towed the steamer to theIllinoisshore and extinguished the fire, and the Wiggins Ferry Company retained Herndon &\n                  Lincoln to sue theOcean Sprayin admiralty for salvage rights to the steamer’s cargo.On Monday, June 21, 1858, Lincoln & Herndon appeared in theU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinoisand requested that JudgeSamuel H. Treatassign a commissioner to take and report on witness testimony in the case. Treat\n                  granted the request and the court heard testimony on Tuesday, June 22. Following the\n                  testimony, the court ruled that the plaintiffs did indeed salvage the ship, and ordered\n                  that the wreck be sold by the court marshal on August 25, 1858. The sale yielded $940,\n                  of which the Wiggins Ferry Company received one third after the deduction of court\n                  costs.Libel, Document ID: 64820,Wiggins Ferry Co. v.
