Douglasthere on July 28 during a stopover on his trip fromClintonto Springfield. He doesn't speak in Decatur until November 1.Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.

        "text": "4In the Illinois race for U.S. Senate in 1858, both Lincoln and Douglas focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the former Whig stronghold of central Illinois, where the state\n                  legislative races were the closest. Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted\n                  were those who had moved into theAmerican Partyfollowing the dissolution of theWhig Party.There was also concern by Republicans during the 1858 election that Douglas would\n                  win votes from their party. Douglas criticized theLecompton ConstitutionandJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in the Democratic Party. Some Republicans\n                  were excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution and although Douglas\n                  later denied it, he courted Republican support. Lincoln and other Republicans were\n                  concerned by these developments and urged fellow party members to remain loyal in\n                  the upcoming election.Allen C.

Lincoln worried that a Crittenden endorsement for Douglas would hurt his chances\n                  with his former Whig brethren in Illinois.  Crittenden welcomed Lincoln's rise to\n                  political prominence, but had little sympathy with the Republican Party. Hearing rumors\n                  that Crittenden favored Douglas's reelection , LincolnwroteCrittenden on July 7 asking if the rumor was true.   Crittenden did not share any\n                  political affinity with Douglas, but he nevertheless shared a strong aversion to the\n                  Lecompton Constitution  with Douglas. TheAdministration's harsh response to Douglas brought sympathy from Crittenden, who expressed his support\n                  of Douglas in aletterto Lincoln on July 29, though expressing \"no disposition for officious intermeddling\"\n                  in the election.Tupper is undoubtedly using the term \"frank\" to refer to  Douglas' privilege of sending\n                  free mail under his signature as a United States senator.Robert J.
