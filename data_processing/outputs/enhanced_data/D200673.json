Supposing you use the word \"subscriber\" as synonamous with \"stockholder\" I answer that in my opinion, such legal liability is raised, upon which such suit\n\nmay be sustained– The reason I note the wordsubscriberis, that I think a person mightsubscribe; and yet if he did not make theadvancepayment, he would not be fixed as a stockholder, and no suit for calls would lie against\n\nhim–3 Second question– \"If there be such legal liability, how far is it affected by that\n\nclause of Sec: 14 which declares that all instalments shall be paid as the Directors may deem fit \"under the penalty of the forfeiture of all previous payments thereon\"4(meaning all previous payments made on each share of said stock)? I find several decisions that this matter of forfeiture is a merely cumulative remedy\n\ngiven the Company; and that it does not at all affect the right of the Company to\n\nmaintain a suit against a delinquent stock-holder– This I believe to be the law– Third question– \"To sustain an action on this legal liability (if any exists) what\n\nmaterial facts should be stated in the declaration? and what will be legal and competent\n\nproof to sustain them?\" As to the declaration– Upon this subject I have examined<Page 2>the books, and reflected a good deal; and my conclusion is that nothing more than\n\na common count is necessary– You will find a very apt precedent for such a count in\n\n2.

The Alton and Sangamon Railroad Company had retainedLincoln & Herndonto collect balances due on shares of capital stock purchased by stockholders. The\n                  Illinois General Assembly chartered the railroad in February 1847 to construct and\n                  operate a railroad between Alton, Illinois, viaNew Berlin, and Springfield, Illinois.  Section two  of the company’s charter allowed the incorporators\n                  to issue $500,000 in stock at $100 per share, and section six required subscribers\n                  to purchase stock by paying $5 on each share subscribed at the time of subscribing\n                  and the balance in installments called for by a board of directors. The incorporators\n                  opened subscription for stock in May 1847.  Many stock subscribers owned property\n                  near the proposed route. On January 29, 1851, however, the General Assembly altered\n                  the charter to allow the company to construct the road on a more direct route, bypassing\n                  the property of several stockholders.  Believing that the change in route voided their\n                  subscription agreements, several investors refused to pay their remaining installments,\n                  and the company  hired Lincoln & Herndon to collect the full subscriptions.  Several\n                  of the delinquent subscribers were fromSangamon County, Illinois, and thirty-seven were fromMadison County, Illinois.  William Martin was among the incorporators.Illinois HouseJournal. 1851. 17th G.
