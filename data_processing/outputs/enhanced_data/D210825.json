Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  efforts during thecampaign of 1858on the formerWhig Partystronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.The result of the 1858 race for the Thirty-Eighth Illinois House of Representatives\n                  district, which  consisted solely of McLean County, was that RepublicanLeonard Swettdefeated Democrat John Gregory by a margin of around 600 votes. McLean County was\n                  in the Sixteenth Illinois Senate district, where Democrat Joel S.
