        "text": "2It does not appear that Abraham Lincoln replied to this letter, as HarmonwroteLincoln again on September 1 reiterating his requests. Lincoln was away from Springfield,\n                  Illinois, traveling between the date of this letter and September 1, then was only\n                  in Springfield for the day before traveling again from that evening until September\n                  5. Both Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas were crisscrossing thestateduring the summer and fall of 1858, delivering public addresses in support of candidates\n                  for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective political parties. Douglas was running for reelection as U.S.\n                  senator forIllinoisand Lincoln was running as the Republican Party’s candidate to supplant him. Lincoln\n                  and Douglas were each highly attuned to the state legislative races in 1858 because\n                  members of the Illinois General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in theU.S. Senateat the time; therefore the outcome of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to theracefor the senate seat.  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Hiram W. BeckwithandWilliam Fithianalso wrote Lincoln letters requesting that he speak in Danville, Illinois. Lincolnrespondedto Fithian’s letter and asked that Fithian share his response with both Beckwith\n                  and Harmon. Lincoln was scheduled to speak and did speak in Danville on September\n                  22, the day after Douglas delivered a public address there. Lyman Trumbull did not\n                  speak alongside Lincoln in Danville. He was scheduled to deliver speeches inJerseyville, Illinois, on September 20 andWarsaw, Illinois, on September 25.In Illinois’s local elections of 1858, Republicans ultimately won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-DouglasDemocratsretained control of the Illinois General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the\n                  U.S. Senate.  Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=8; September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=9; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 556-57; Allen C.
