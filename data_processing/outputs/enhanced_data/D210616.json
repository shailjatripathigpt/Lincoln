        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Kellogg of December 11, 1854, has not been located, but\n                  was likely similar to others he wrote around that time requesting his allies’ help\n                  in canvassing theirIllinois General Assemblymembers for support of his potential candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate. Lincoln hadwrittentoHugh Lamasteron November 29, 1854 asking for Lamaster’s assistance in soliciting the vote of his\n                  local Whig member of the General Assembly, Amos C. Babcock. Lincoln had also asked\n                  Lamaster if Kellogg would be willing to help with the matter. Lamasterrepliedin a letter of December 11, 1854 that while he had not seen Kellogg or Babcock, Kellogg\n                  had previously expressed his support for Lincoln, and newly-elected Whig representative\n                  Babcock was politically inexperienced but would soon learn his duty.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln did\n                  not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska\n                  DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.

The sole vote he received was from Babcock and he did not appear as a candidate\n                  in subsequent rounds of voting. Babcock switched his vote to Lincoln for votes two\n                  through five, supportedOrville H.
