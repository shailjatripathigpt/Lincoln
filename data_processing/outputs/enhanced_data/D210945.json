        "text": "3In 1858, Douglas was running for reelection to theU.S. Senate; Lincoln was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace him. In the summer and fall of that year, the two candidates\n                  engaged in aseries of political debatesthroughout the state. On August 27, during the second debate at Freeport, Illinois,\n                  Lincoln posed four questions concerning the admission ofKansasto the Union and the expansion of slavery in U.S. territories. In his second question,\n                  Lincoln asked Douglas whether the people of a territory could, in light of theDred Scott decision, “exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution?”\n                  Douglas responded by establishing what became called his “Freeport Doctrine.” Douglas\n                  answered yes, citizens could exclude slavery by local legislation. “Slavery cannot\n                  exist a day or an hour anywhere,” Douglas famously retorted, “ unless it is supported\n                  by local police regulations, furnishing remedies and means of enforcing the right\n                  to hold slaves.” Douglas’s Freeport Doctrine resolved the inconsistency between popular\n                  sovereignty and the Dred Scott decision, satisfying his Illinois supporters and assuring\n                  his reelection to the Senate.  See1858 Federal Election.Douglas’s position, however, hurt his national standing in the Democratic Party. \n                  In late 1857, Douglas’s criticism of PresidentJames Buchanan’s support for Kansas’sLecompton Constitutionhad already caused a rift among party faithful. Trumbull recognized theRichmond Enquirer’s misinterpretation of Douglas’s reply at Freeport as another opportunity to exploit\n                  this rift--hence his suggestion that  Lincoln ask another question to prompt Douglas\n                  to explicitly denounce Congress’s power to enact a slave code in the territories.The Freeport Doctrine and Douglas’s continued defense of popular sovereignty during\n                  the Lincoln-Douglas Debates further alienated Southern pro-slavery Democrats, denting\n                  his position in the Democratic Party and chances in the American South in thepresidential election of 1860.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445, 457-58, 501-4, 513-14,\n                     553-57; Frank L.

At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  in Monroe and other counties  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewould determine the outcome of the race for U.S. Senate.  In the local elections\n                  of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas\n                  Democrats retained control of the General Assembly, allowing Douglas to win reelection.\n                  In Monroe County, DemocratWilliam H. Underwood, elected in 1856 to the Illinois Senate, held over in 1858.  In the race for the\n                  seat representing the Eleventh House District, DemocratWilliam R.
