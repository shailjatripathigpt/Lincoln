James does appear in\n                  the official registers of the officers and agents of the federal government for 1849,\n                  1851, and 1853, so apparently he did not receive  an appointment.Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849);Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853);Abraham Lincoln to Unknown;Abraham Lincoln to George W.

        "text": "4James references the contest to see who would replaceRichard M. Youngas commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office.Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere among the early contestants. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.In early June, Lincoln asked supporters of his candidacy to send him letters to that\n                  effect.  Presumably, he made the same request of James.  James promised to forward\n                  more names to Lincoln in Washington, DC, because Lincoln, at the urging  ofWilliam H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, had decided  to travel to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19.On June 12, JameswroteLincoln again, sending along recommendations fromPekin, Illinois.   Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the\n                  job went to Butterfield instead.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair.William H.
