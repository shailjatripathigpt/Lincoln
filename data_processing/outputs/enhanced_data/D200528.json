Taylorwould be a verdict of the American people, against any restriction or restraint to\n\nthe extension and perpetuation of slavery in newly acquired territory.2In this he resorted to no special pleading, but with well arranged and pertinent\n\nfacts, and sincere arguments he fully demonstrated it. During his speech he introduced\n\nseveral humorous, but very appropriate illustrations.3",
