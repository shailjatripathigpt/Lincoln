        "text": "2James F. Joy’s letter of November 28, 1854  has not been found, but it evidently notified\n                  Lincoln that Joy would be joining him in representing theIllinois Central Railroad Companyin the appeal ofIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parke. Lincoln had beenretainedin this role byMason Braymanin October 1853. The case ofIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parkestemmed from an attempt byMcLean Countyto tax the Illinois Central Railroad on 118 acres of land which the railroad owned\n                  in that county. The railroad refused to pay the $428.57 in taxes levied by the county\n                  assessor on the grounds that the act of theIllinois General Assemblyincorporating the railroad exempted it from taxes. In September 1853, the railroad\n                  sued McLean County inMcLean County Circuit Court, requesting an injunction to prevent the county from selling railroad land to pay\n                  the taxes. The litigants reached an agreement that the court would dismiss the bill,\n                  effectively ruling for McLean County, and the railroad would appeal the case to theIllinois Supreme Courtat the December 1853 term in Springfield where the only question would be whether\n                  the county had a lawful right to tax Illinois Central Railroad property.Abraham Lincoln to Mason Brayman;Illinois Central RR v.

The second division of the Illinois\n                  Supreme Court which was held in Springfield had a December term. The Supreme Court\n                  commenced in Springfield on December 12, 1853, but adjourned day to day until Wednesday,\n                  January 4, 1854. The case ofIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parkewas heard at Springfield on February 28, 1854. The case was continued until January\n                  16, 1856,  at which point the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s judgment\n                  and JusticeWalter B. Scatesruled that the Illinois General Assembly could exempt property from taxation and\n                  thus the Illinois Central Railroad’s charter was constitutional.Eugene L.
