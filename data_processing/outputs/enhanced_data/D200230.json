        "text": "2Illinoiswas slow to embrace education reform and teacher training.  In 1825, theGeneral Assemblyenacted legislation to establish free schools, but this act neither mentioned teachers\n                  nor established criteria for their training or certification.  None of the colleges\n                  or academies incorporated in the 1830s offered teacher education.  OnlyCook Countyempowered its school inspectors to vet candidates for teaching positions.Viewing public education as a vehicle for economic prosperity and cultural solidity,\n                  theWhig Partybecame a staunch proponent of educational reform and teacher training.  Lincoln endorsed\n                  the Whig belief in the importance of qualified teachers, as evidenced by his proposed\n                  resolution. The General Assembly incorporated the substance of this resolution into\n                  section 81 of anactestablishing and maintaining common schools.“An Act Providing for the Establishment of Free Schools,” 15 January 1825,Revised Laws of Illinois(1833), 556-62; “An Act relating to Schools in Township 39 North, Range 14 East,”\n                     6 February 1835,Laws of Illinois(1835), 161-63; Robert P.
