        "text": "3Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate. See the1854 Federal Election.Charles H. Ray opposed Lincoln’s candidacy.  He wrote to Washburne on December 16,\n                  1854, “I cannot well go in for Lincoln or anyone of his tribe. I have little faith\n                  in the strength of their anti-slavery sentiments.”  Ray was equally explicit in a\n                  letter dated December 24: “I must confess I am afraid of ‘Abe.’ He is Southern by\n                  birth, Southern in his associations and Southern, if I mistake not, in his sympathies.\n                  . . His wife, you know, is a Todd, of a pro-slavery family, and so are all his kin.\n                  My candidate must be like Caesor’s wife—not only not suspected, but above suspicion.”\n                  Despite his reservations, Ray soon decided that Lincoln was in fact the best choice\n                  for the anti-slaveryRepublicansand advised his friends to support Lincoln for the Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

After the ninth vote, with his share\n                  of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his remaining supporters\n                  to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected.
