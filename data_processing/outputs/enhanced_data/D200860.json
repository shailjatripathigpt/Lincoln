    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to Joshua F. Speed, 24 August 18551 You know what a poor correspondent I am.– Ever since I received your very agreeable\n\nletter of the 22ndof May, I have been intending to write you in answer to it.2You suggest that in political action now, you and I would differ.– I suppose we would;\n\nnot quite so much, however, as you may think. You know I dislike Slavery; and you\n\nfully admit the abstract wrong of it. So far, there is no cause of difference. But\n\nyou say that, sooner than yield your legal right to the Slave— especially at the bidding\n\nof those who are not themselves interested— you would see the Union dissolved. I am\n\nnot aware that any one is bidding you to yield that right; very certainly I am not.– I leave that matter\n\nentirely to yourself. I also acknowledgeyourrights andmyobligations under the Constitution, in^regard to^your Slaves. I confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down, and caught and\n\ncarried back to their Stripes and unrewarded toil; but I bite my lip and keep quiet.3In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip, on a Steamboat fromLouisvilletoSt Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth of theOhio, there were, on board, ten or a dozen Slaves, Shackled together with Irons.–4That sight was a continual torment to me; and I see something like it every time\n\nI touch the Ohio, or any other Slave border. It is hardly fair for you to assume,\n\nthat I have no interest in a thing which has and continually exercises, the power\n\nof making me miserable. You ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of\n\nthe Northern people do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty\n\nto the Constitution and the Union!<Page 2>I do oppose the extension of Slavery, because my judgment and feelings prompt me;\n\nand I am under no obligation to the Contrary. If for this you and I must differ, differ\n\nwe must. You say if you were President, you would send an Army and hang the leaders\n\nof theMissourioutrages upon theKansaselections; still if Kansas fairly votes herself a Slave State, she must be admitted,\n\nor the Union must be dissolved.5But how, if she votes herself a Slave Stateunfairly— that is, by the very means for which you say you would hang men? Must she still\n\nbe admitted, or the Union dissolved? That will be the phase of the question when it\n\nfirst becomes a practical one.– In your assumption that there may be a fair decision\n\nof the Slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I would differ about theNebraska-law. I look upon that enactment not as alaw, but as aviolencefrom the beginning. It was conceived in violence, passed in violence, is maintained\n\nin violence, and is being executed in violence. I say it wasconceivedin violence, because the destruction of theMissouri Compromise, under the circumstances, was nothing less than violence. It waspassedin violence, because it could not have passed at all, but for the votes of many members,\n\nin violent disregard of the known will of their constituents. It ismaintainedin violence because the elections since, clearly demand its repeal and the demand\n\nis openly disregarded.6Yousay men ought to be hung for the way they are executing that law; &Isay the way it is being executed, is quite as good as any of its antecedents. It\n\nis being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first; else why does\n\nnoNebraskaman express astonishment or condemnation? PoorReederis the only public man who has been silly enough to believe that any thing like fairness was ever<Page 3>intended; and he has been bravely undeceived. That Kansas will form a Slave Constitution, and, with it, will ask to be admitted\n\ninto the Union, I take to be an already settled question; and so settled by the very\n\nmeans you so pointedly condemn.7By every principle of law ever held by any court, North or South, every Negro taken\n\nto Kansas is Free; yet in utter disregard of this— in the spirit of violence merely—\n\nthat beautifulLegislaturegravely passes a law to hang men who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal\n\nrights. This is the substance, and real object of the law.8If, like Haman, they should hang upon a gallows of their own building, I shall not\n\nbe among the mourners for their fate.9 In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the restoration of the Missouri Compromise,\n\nso long as Kansas remains a territory; and when, by all these foul means, it seeks\n\nto come into the Union as a Slave State, I shall oppose it. I am very loth, in any case, to withhold my assent to the enjoyment of propertyacquired, orlocated, in good faith; but I do not admit thatgoodfaithin taking a negro to Kansas, to be held in Slavery, is apossibilitywith any man. Any man who has sense enough to be the controller of his own property,\n\nhas too much sense to misunderstand the outrageous character of this whole Nebraska\n\nbusiness. But I digress.– In my opposition to the admission of Kansas, I shall have\n\nsome company; but we may be beaten; if we are, I shall not, on that account, attempt\n\nto dissolve the Union. On the contrary, if we succeed, there will be enough of us\n\nto take care of the Union. I think it probable, however, we shall be beaten. Standing as a unit among yourselves,\n\nyou can, directly, and indirectly bribe enough of our men to carry the day— as you\n\ncould on an open proposition to establish a monarchy– Get hold of some man in the\n\nNorth, whose position and ability is such that he can make the support<Page 4>of your measure— whatever it may be— aDemocraticpartynecessity, and the thing is done.Approposof this, let me tell you an anecdote.Douglasintroduced theNebraska billin January. In February afterwards, there was a called Session of theIllinois Legislature. Of the one hundred members composing the two branches of that body, about Seventy\n\nwere Democrats. These latter held a caucus, in which the Nebraska bill was talked\n\nof, if not formally discussed. It was thereby discovered that just three, and no more,\n\nwere in favor of the measure. In a day or two Douglas’ orders came on to have resolutions\n\npassed approving the bill; and they were passed by large majorities!!! The truth of\n\nthis is vouched for by a bolting Democratic member. The masses too, Democratic as\n\nwell asWhig, were even nearer unanimous against it; but as soon as the party necessity of supporting\n\nit became apparent, the way thedemocracybegan to see theWisdomandjusticeof it, was perfectly astonishing.10 You say if Kansas fairly votes herself a free State, as a Christian you will rather\n\nrejoice at it. All decent Slaveholderstalkthat way; and I do not doubt their candor. But they nevervotethat way. Although in a private letter, or conversation, you will express your preference\n\nthat Kansas shall be free, you would vote for no man forCongress, who would say the same thing publicly. No Such man could be elected from any district\n\nin any Slave State. You thinkStringfellowought to be hung; and yet, at the nextPresidential electionyou will vote for the exact type and Representative of StringfellowThe Slave-breeders and Slave-traders, are a small, odious and detested class, among\n\nyou; and yet in politics, they dictate the course of all of you, and are as completely\n\nyour masters, as you are the masters of your own negroes. You enquire where I now stand. That is a disputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say\n\nthere are no whigs, and that I am anabolitionist. When I was atWashingtonI voted for theWilmot Provisoas good as forty-times, and I never heard of any one attempting to unwhig me for that.11I now do no more than oppose theextensionof Slavery. I am not aKnow-Nothing— that is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people?\n\nOur progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty refined. As a nation we began\n\nby declaring that “allmenarecreatedequal”12We now practically read it “all men are created equal,exceptnegroes.” When the know-nothings get control, it will read “all men are created equal except\n\nnegroes,andforeigners,andCatholics.” When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make\n\nno pretence of loving liberty— toRussia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the baseofalloy of hypocricy. Marywill probably pass a day or two in Louisville in OctoberMy kindest regards toMrs. Speed. On the leading subject of this letter, I have more of her Sympathy than I have of\n\nyours. And yet let me say I am your friend forever.",

Douglas on\n                  February 23, 1854 by a vote of fourteen to eight, with five Democrats voting against\n                  the resolutions. TheIllinois House of Representativespassed resolutions of approval two days later, with thirty-six house members voting\n                  for the resolutions, twenty-two voting against them, and eighteen not voting. Among\n                  Democrats in the House, thirty-three supported the resolutions, eight voted  against\n                  them, and thirteen did not vote.It is uncertain who Lincoln refers to in describing a “bolting democratic member”\n                  of the Illinois General Assembly who broke ranks over Douglas purportedly ordering\n                  the passage of resolutions in support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. One possibility\n                  is Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives,John Reynolds, who voted in support of the resolutions only to recant his vote the following month\n                  and declare the resolutions to be a mistake on the part of the General Assembly and\n                  “a misrepresentation of the popular will.” In an additionalrecountingof this anecdote, Lincoln altered his description of the episode to say that there\n                  were in fact multiple Illinois Democrats who broke with their caucus on this issue\n                  and confessed publicly that the resolutions were actually unpopular with Illinois\n                  Democrats,  who supported them not as a matter of conscience, but only to bolster\n                  Douglas.Arthur Charles Cole,The Era of the Civil War 1848-1870, vol. 3 ofThe Centennial History of Illinois(Springfield: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1919), 121-22; Illinois HouseJournal. 1854.  18th G.

        "text": "You know what a poor correspondent I am.– Ever since I received your very agreeable\n               letter of the 22ndof May, I have been intending to write you in answer to it.2You suggest that in political action now, you and I would differ.– I suppose we would;\n               not quite so much, however, as you may think. You know I dislike Slavery; and you\n               fully admit the abstract wrong of it. So far, there is no cause of difference. But\n               you say that, sooner than yield your legal right to the Slave— especially at the bidding\n               of those who are not themselves interested— you would see the Union dissolved. I am\n               not aware that any one is bidding you to yield that right; very certainly I am not.– I leave that matter\n               entirely to yourself. I also acknowledgeyourrights andmyobligations under the Constitution, in^regard to^your Slaves. I confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down, and caught and\n               carried back to their Stripes and unrewarded toil; but I bite my lip and keep quiet.3In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip, on a Steamboat fromLouisvilletoSt Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth of theOhio, there were, on board, ten or a dozen Slaves, Shackled together with Irons.–4That sight was a continual torment to me; and I see something like it every time\n               I touch the Ohio, or any other Slave border. It is hardly fair for you to assume,\n               that I have no interest in a thing which has and continually exercises, the power\n               of making me miserable. You ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of\n               the Northern people do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty\n               to the Constitution and the Union!<Page 2>I do oppose the extension of Slavery, because my judgment and feelings prompt me;\n               and I am under no obligation to the Contrary. If for this you and I must differ, differ\n               we must. You say if you were President, you would send an Army and hang the leaders\n               of theMissourioutrages upon theKansaselections; still if Kansas fairly votes herself a Slave State, she must be admitted,\n               or the Union must be dissolved.5But how, if she votes herself a Slave Stateunfairly— that is, by the very means for which you say you would hang men? Must she still\n               be admitted, or the Union dissolved? That will be the phase of the question when it\n               first becomes a practical one.– In your assumption that there may be a fair decision\n               of the Slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I would differ about theNebraska-law. I look upon that enactment not as alaw, but as aviolencefrom the beginning. It was conceived in violence, passed in violence, is maintained\n               in violence, and is being executed in violence. I say it wasconceivedin violence, because the destruction of theMissouri Compromise, under the circumstances, was nothing less than violence. It waspassedin violence, because it could not have passed at all, but for the votes of many members,\n               in violent disregard of the known will of their constituents. It ismaintainedin violence because the elections since, clearly demand its repeal and the demand\n               is openly disregarded.6Yousay men ought to be hung for the way they are executing that law; &Isay the way it is being executed, is quite as good as any of its antecedents. It\n               is being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first; else why does\n               noNebraskaman express astonishment or condemnation? PoorReederis the only public man who has been silly enough to believe that any thing like fairness was ever<Page 3>intended; and he has been bravely undeceived."

In February afterwards, there was a called Session of theIllinois Legislature. Of the one hundred members composing the two branches of that body, about Seventy\n               were Democrats. These latter held a caucus, in which the Nebraska bill was talked\n               of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby discovered that just three, and no more,\n               were in favor of the measure. In a day or two Douglas’ orders came on to have resolutions\n               passed approving the bill; and they were passed by large majorities!!! The truth of\n               this is vouched for by a bolting Democratic member. The masses too, Democratic as\n               well asWhig, were even nearer unanimous against it; but as soon as the party necessity of supporting\n               it became apparent, the way thedemocracybegan to see theWisdomandjusticeof it, was perfectly astonishing.10"
