Baker, and John J.\n                  Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective Whig congressmen.\n                  Hardin and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed that the 1846 nomination\n                  should have been his. In September 1845, Lincoln inquired of Hardin’s plans, but Hardin\n                  would not answer definitively one way or the other. In the meantime, Lincoln worked\n                  to galvanize support within the district.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 2:218, 231;Abraham Lincoln to Henry E. Dummer.On December 27, 1845, James’ paper, theTazewell Whig, issued an editorial recommending Lincoln receive the Congressional nomination over\n                  Hardin, citing the Pekin convention and the principle of “turn about is fair play.”\n                  \n                  Roy P.
