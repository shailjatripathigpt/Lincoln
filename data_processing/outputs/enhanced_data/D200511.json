        "text": "1The issue was over an attempted call of the house--a procedure that allowed a legislative\n                  body to compel members to present themselves for a vote on a particular matter.  On\n                  July 12, 1848, RepresentativeWilliam Sawyer, citing the length of time theHouse of Representativeshad been in session--seven hours--without being able to get a quorum because members\n                  were  absent without leave against the rules of the House, moved that the sergeant-at-arms\n                  retain the offending members in custody until the following morning, when they would\n                  be brought in to give their excuses and receive their penalties.  The House approved\n                  this motion, with Abraham Lincoln voting yea.  On the morning of July 13, the sergeant-at-arms,\n                  pursuant to the House order, reported that he had arrested, and had present with him,\n                  fifty-two members who  had been absent without leave.  RepresentativeCharles Hudsonmoved that the vote of the previous evening be re-considered, but Speaker Robert\n                  C. Winthrop ruled that motion out of order, as the sergeant-at-arms had already executed\n                  the order.  Hudson    then moved to dispense with any further proceedings in the call,\n                  and the fines imposed on the absent members be remitted.  After other representatives\n                  commented, Botts moved the previous question.U.S. HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 1034-35;Cong. Globe, 30th Cong., 1st Sess., 926, 928 (1848)."
