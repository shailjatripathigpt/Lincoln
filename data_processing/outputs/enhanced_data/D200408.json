P. Speed– It incidentally enlarges your liability to W. P. Speed; and to that extent, you\n\nare injured– How much will this be? I think, $100– or $120– being the dividend of\n\n25 or 30 per cent, that Hurst's half of the Fry debt, would<Page 2>would pay on the W. P.

P. S. debt,– a debt that\n\nHurst is under no obligation to indemnify you against– Hurst is bound to account to\n\nBell's estate, for one half of the Fry debt; because he owed half, and Bell's estate\n\npays all; and if, upon such accounting any thing is due the estate from Hurst, it\n\nwill swell the estate, and so far enlarge the dividend to the W. P. S. debt– But when\n\nBell's estate shall call Hurst to account, he will will^I am informed^show that the estate, after paying the whole of the Fry debt is still indebted to\n\nhim– If so, not much, if any thing can come from that quarter—nothing, unless it can\n\nbe so turned, as to compel him payallhe owes the estate, and take adividendonly, upon what the estate owes him– If you had paid the Fry debt yourself, you could\n\nthen turn on Hurst and make him refund you; but this would only bring where you started\n\nfrom, excepting it would leave Bell's estate able to pay a larger dividend, and<Page 3>Hurst would then turn upon the estate to contribute one half, which would enlarge\n\nthe indebtedness of the estate in the same proportion, and so reduce the dividend\n\nagain– I believe the only thing that can be done for your advantage in the matter,\n\nis for Bell's administrator to call Hurst to account for one half the Fry debt, and\n\nthen fight off, the best he can, Hurst's claim of indebtedness against the estate– I should be much pleased to seehere again; but I must, in candour, say I do not perceive how your personal presence would do any good in the business\n\nmatter– You, no doubt, assign the suspension of our correspondence to the true philosophical\n\ncause, though it must be confessed, by both of us, that this is rather a cold reason\n\nfor allowing a friendship, such as ours, to die by degrees– I propose now, that, on\n\nthe receipt of this, you shall be considered in my debt, and under obligation to pay\n\nsoon, and that neither shall remain long in arrears hereafter– Are you agreed?– Being elected toCongress, though I am very grateful to our friends, for having done it, has not pleased me\n\nas much as I expected–5 We have anotherboy, born the 10thof March last– He is very much a child asBobwas at his age—rather of a longer order– Bob is \"short and low,\" and, I expect, always\n\nwill be– He<Page 4>talks very plainly—almost as plainly as any body– He is quite smart enough– I some\n\ntimes fear he is one of the little rare-ripe sort, that are smarter at about five\n\nthan ever after– He has a great deal of that sort of mischief, that is the offspring\n\nof much animal spirits– Since I begun this letter a messenger came to tell me, Bob\n\nwas lost; but by the time I reached the house, hismotherhad found him, and had him whiped—and, by now, very likely he is run away again– Maryhas read your letter, and wishes to be remembered to MrsS. and you, in which I most sincerely join her–",
