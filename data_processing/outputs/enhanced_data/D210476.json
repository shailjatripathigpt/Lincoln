Lincoln responded to this letter sometime\n                  before April 23. Lincoln’s letter has not been located, but he apparently advised\n                  Thompson to circulate a petition on Gridley’s behalf. ThompsonwroteLincoln on April 23 that a petition supporting Gridley, addressed to Collamer, was\n                  in circulation in Pekin. Gridley would remain postmaster until  April 1853.Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832-1971, NARA Microfilm Publication, M841, 145 rolls, Records of the Post Office Department,\n                     RG 28, 1845-1855, 18:186, National Archives Building, Washington, DC;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), *485;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851), 544*;Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853), 514*."
