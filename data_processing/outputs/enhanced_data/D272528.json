    "full_text": "Petition of Nathan M. Knapp and Others to U.S. Congress, 1 The Petition of sundry citizens of Scott county Illinois, asking for the establishment\n\nof a Post Road therein named–3^from St Louis Mo– to Jacksonville Ill.^ Your petitioners, citizens of the County ofScottState ofIllinois, represent, as they have often heretofore fruitlessly done, that they are without\n\ntheir due and just proportion of Mail Facilities. The County of Scott lies upon theIllinois River, comprises an area of about six townships or 216 square miles, with about 1400 voters\n\nand over 7000 inhabitants, an intelligent, reading, industrious community. The county\n\nseat,Winchester, is 10 miles from the river, some 22 miles north easterly fromCarroltoninGreene County, 16 miles fromJacksonvilleinMorgan county. Most of the inhabitants of the county receive their mail at Winchester; and for\n\nthis they depend upon a semi-weekly mail running betweenLouisiana Mo& Jacksonville; and as the important mail for this region comes by way ofSt Louis, it passes through a corner of the county about eight miles from the county seat,\n\ngoes on to Jacksonville and there lies over till brought here by the Louisiana Mail,\n\nthis occasions, two, three and some times more days delay in the Mail for Winchester,\n\nand when obstructions occur at the Illinois River, which is frequently the case, weeks\n\nintervene, to the very great discomfiture of the community and specially of the Town\n\nof Winchester.2Said Town contains 800 inhabitants, has 10 dry Goods Stores, two Drugs & Chemicals\n\ntwo \" Groceris, Six establishments for the manufacture of Stone-ware, three Steam Mills, two Water\n\nMills, seven Smith’s Shops, carriage makers Harness makers, Patent Circular Saw Mill\n\nmanufacturer, & all other mechanical business in proportion, also two pork-Packing\n\nestablishments, Scarcely any inland town of its size transacts the amount & variety\n\nof business, that is done in & through the town of Winchester. Yet we have appealed\n\nand appealed in vain for adequate & proportional mail accommodations. Your petitioners\n\nare well aware that it would not be consistent with a proper policy on the part of\n\nthe Government to create additional facilities if the whole benefit terminated upon\n\nthe town of Winchester; but your petitioners conceive that an arrangement can be made,\n\nby which they can be accommodated in connexion with other places without being partial to any section: The plan they propose is to have a line of four Horse Post coaches run between Jacksonville^& St Louis^so as to make between those places six trips per week, and dividing the route at\n\nCarrolton orWhite-Hallin Green County (as may be deemed most advisable) So that three trips per-week shall\n\nbe made via Winchester from St Louis to Jacksonville & vice versa, & three upon the\n\npresent route. About one year ago Messers “Hinton& Co.” made this arrangement and run till the company failed, only a few Weeks; but\n\nthey reported good profits in passenger line during the time they run as there is\n\nmuch communication between this & St Louis and when the river is closed, as it is\n\nin the winter, the travel is all done through the stage line if running, & even when\n\nthe river is not closed many prefer the Stage on account of the uncertainty of boats.\n\nYour petioners therefore entertain the hope that their wishes will find favor with your Hon. body\n\nand that the arrangement proposed will be made permanent. By effecting this the Louisiana\n\nmail may terminate at Winchester instead of going to Jacksonville & thus cut 16 miles\n\noff from that route. The accompanying plat will give your Hon body a correct idea of the proposed route\n\n& enoble you to understand the prayer of your petitioners more clearly & they as in duty bound\n\nwill pray as long as necessary but hope this will be their last prayer on this subject. Your Petitioners, citizens of Illinois request your Honorable body to establish a\n\nDaily mail Line of Four Horse Post Coaches between St Louis and Jacksonville, to run\n\ntri-weekly through Winchester, and tri-weekly on the present route.",
