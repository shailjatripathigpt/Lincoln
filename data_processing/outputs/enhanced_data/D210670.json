        "text": "2Camp is discussing the case ofCochran & Hall v. Camp et al., which commenced in theU.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinoisin October, 1855.  The case concerned a dispute over ownership of lands near theOhio & Mississippi Railroad. The firms of H. C. Seymour & Company and Sanger, Camp & Company had joined together\n                  in 1852 to purchase over $6,000 worth of U.S. government land warrants for 1,080 acres\n                  along the railroad for the purpose of speculation. Initially, the two firms, along\n                  with other individuals, had proposed making the purchases as a land association, but\n                  the agreement was apparently verbal and the contemplated land association fell apart\n                  when the parties attempted to codify the terms. Camp, a partner in Sanger, Camp &\n                  Co., held the title to the warrants in order to locate the land and purchased the\n                  property in his own name.George W. CochranandJames C. Hall, two of the individuals who had discussed forming the land association, later acquired\n                  H. C. Seymour & Co.’s interest in the property and claimed that they had not received\n                  their due percentage of the land. The pair sued Camp to convey the 1,080 acres. Camp\n                  retained Lincoln andWilliam H. Herndon, who were unable to effect a compromise but continued to represent him in the case\n                  until Lincoln’selectionas president in 1860. The case was settled in 1863 and the court ultimately found\n                  for the plaintiffs and ordered Camp to convey his interest to Cochran, who had purchased\n                  Hall’s interest.The plaintiffs’ attorneysJohn T. StuartandBenjamin S. Edwardsfiled the amended bill mentioned here on June 15, 1857. The answer to this amended\n                  bill was prepared by another attorney for the defendants,Newton D. Strong.Cochran & Hall v. Camp et al., Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition,  2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),http://www.lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Details.aspx?case=137521."
