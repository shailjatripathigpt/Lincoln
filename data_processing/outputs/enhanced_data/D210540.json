In early June 1849, Lincoln\n                  sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting letters in support of his candidacy\n                  for commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Presumably, he made a similar request of Smith.Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B. Herrick;Abraham Lincoln to James M. McLean;Abraham Lincoln to Robert C. Schenck;Abraham Lincoln to Joseph R. Underwood;Abraham Lincoln to William A. Minshall and Robert S.

President Zachary Taylor,\n                  however, was ultimately responsible for appointing the commissioner of the U.S. General\n                  Land Office. In the end, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment;\n                  the job went to Butterfield instead.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair."
