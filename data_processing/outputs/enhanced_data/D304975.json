In the Preface, dated 1855, she\n                  wrote, “Some who read the following sketches may be inclined to believe that a residence\n                  among our native brethren and an attachment growing out of our peculiar relation to\n                  them, have exaggerated our sympathies, and our sense of the wrongs they have  received\n                  at the hands of the whites. This is not the place to discuss that point. There is\n                  a tribunal at which man shall be judged for that which he has meted out to his fellow-man.”Juliette A. M. Kinzie,Wau-Bun, The Early Day in the Northwest(Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1873), vii."
