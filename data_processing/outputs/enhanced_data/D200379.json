Hardin and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed\n                  that the 1846 nomination should have been his. In September 1845, Lincoln inquired\n                  of Hardin’s plans, but Hardin would not answer definitively one way or the other.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 2:218, 231."
