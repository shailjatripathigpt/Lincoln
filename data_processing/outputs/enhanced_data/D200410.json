At the time this letter was written, Lockwood\n                  was likely in Springfield for the appellate court.   It is likely that Dummer asked\n                  Lincoln to obtain a signature or document from Lockwood that related to a case Dummer\n                  was handling on appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.Eugene L.
