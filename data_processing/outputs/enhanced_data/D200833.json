        "text": "2Lincoln is referring to the election forIllinois’ representative in theU.S. Senate—in which he was a candidate—being finished.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened his passion for politics, and he had thrown himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates.  He even allowed himself to become\n                  a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, his name\n                  began to circulate as a possible nominee to supplant Democratic incumbent James Shields\n                  as U.S. Senator.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.The Illinois General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to elect\n                  a U.S. senator. Ten rounds of voting were needed to finally determine the victor.\n                  Lincoln received a majority of the anti-Nebraska votes until the tenth and final ballot,\n                  when he withdrew and urged his supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska Democrat Lyman\n                  Trumbull in order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With\n                  the votes of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See the1854 Federal Election.William H. Randolph to Abraham Lincoln; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L. Scripps; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:392, 401-2;Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 10 November 1854, 2:5; 2 January 1855, 2:3; Ill.
