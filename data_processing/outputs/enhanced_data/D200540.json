Schlater, clerk” listed in\n                  the city directory for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for 1853, and a “C. W. Schlatter,\n                  clerk,” in the directory for 1854.  He suggested that both Lincoln and the compiler\n                  of the directory were perhaps puzzled over Schlater’s middle initial and last name.\n                  Further research allowed the editors to identify “C. U. Schlater” as Casper U. Schlater.Roy P.
