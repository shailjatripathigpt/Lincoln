No biography or autobiography of Lincoln appeared in\n                  theChicago Press and Tribunein 1858 or 1859. However, LincolnsentCharles Lanmanbiographical information  in August 1858. He also composed a brief biography forJesse W. Fellin December 1859, and collaborated withJohn L. Scrippson a lengthier biography in the summer of 1860.Although Ray’s desire to tout Lincoln’s humble beginnings  for campaign purposes was\n                  not realized during the1858 election campaign, Lincoln’s supporters revived the idea in 1860. During the1860 Federal Election, supporters labeled Lincoln “the Rail Candidate” in an effort to emphasize his pioneer\n                  origins and enhance his popular appeal.  The label stuck, eventually evolving into\n                  the nickname “the Rail Splitter.”David Herbert Donald,Lincoln, 244-45."
