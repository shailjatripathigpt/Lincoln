Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective\n                  Whig congressmen. Hardin and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed that the\n                  1846 nomination should have been his. In September 1845, Lincoln inquired of Hardin’s\n                  plans, but Hardin would not answer definitively one way or the other.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 2:218, 231."

On November 15,\n                  theAlton Telegraph and Democratic Reviewnoted that the James’s paper had put forth Hardin’s name for governor. It implied\n                  first-hand knowledge that Hardin would not run for governor, and posited that while\n                  no Whig could win statewide office, the congressional race would be an opportunity\n                  with a greater chance of success.The Tazewell Whig(Tremont, IL), 1 November 1845, 2:1; 8 November 1845, 2:1; 15 November 1845, 2:1;Alton Telegraph and Democratic Review(IL), 15 November 1845, 2:3."
