        "text": "2Anderson was seeking compensation from the United States government for his loss,\n                  but the law was not on his side.  In February 1833 and December 1834,Congresspassed laws compensating volunteers for horses or arms lost in the war.  These laws\n                  only allowed pay for horses killed in battle or dying for want of forage; and by the\n                  interpretation ofPeter Hagner, 3rd Auditor of the United States, even these could not be paid for unless the owner\n                  was himself in the public service at the time of the loss.  In December 1836, theGeneral Assemblyhad passed ajoint resolutionurging Congress to pass an additional law compensating Illinoisans for property losses\n                  incurred during the war. One class of claims highlighted in the resolution was those\n                  of volunteers who lost horses or other equipment.  The General Assembly protested\n                  against the current laws and the interpretation of the Hagner.   Congress took no\n                  action on the joint resolution, and it is uncertain whether Anderson ever received\n                  compensation for his loss.Lincoln wrote affidavit for Anderson, Martha L.
