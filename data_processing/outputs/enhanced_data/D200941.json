        "text": "3The above notice and Lincoln’s note are related to the casePhares v. Jennings & Oatman. Both Sidney Darrow and Roswell Keeler were indeed deposed in the case.In the case, Allen W. Phares sued William A. Jennings and James R. Oatman in September\n                  1856 in the DeWitt County Circuit Court for $6,000 in damages. Phares claimed that\n                  Jennings and Oatman failed to pay him for shelled corn and corn sacks that he shipped\n                  to them between March and May of 1856. Lincoln,Asahel Gridley,  andJohn H. Wickizerrepresented Jennings and Oatman; Weldon, Moore, andJames Strainrepresented Phares. The case came before the DeWitt County Circuit Court in October\n                  1856, but was continued at least twice. In March 1857, the parties reached a settlement\n                  in which Jennings and Oatman agreed to pay Phares $2,450.Phares v. Jennings & Oatman, Martha L.
