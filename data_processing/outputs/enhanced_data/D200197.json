Under provisions of\n                  section twenty-six, elections had occurred in 1834, 1836, 1838, and were scheduled\n                  for August 1840.  In January 1839, theGeneral Assemblyenacted, and theCouncil of Revisionapproved, anactstipulating that  on the first Monday of August, 1841, and on the first Monday of\n                  August every second year thereafter, there was to be held an election for theHouse of Representatives.  This act explicitly repealed section twenty-six of the 1829 law.  On January 21,William J. Hankinsintroduced in theIllinois House of Representativesa bill entitled “A Bill in Relation to the Election of Members of Congress.” The\n                  text of the bill is not extant, but presumably it would have repealed the January\n                  1839 act and reinstated section twenty-six. \n                  The House passed the bill by a vote of 45 yeas to 39 nays, with Lincoln voting nay,\n                  but theSenateindefinitely postponed further consideration on January 30, and the bill never became\n                  law.“An Act Regulating Elections,” 10 January 1829,Revised Laws of Illinois(1829), 67;Abraham Lincoln to John T.

Basler further speculates that since the letter\n                  bears no closing or signature, the page bearing the resolutions also carried the consummation\n                  of the letter.  Lincoln did not, however, write the resolutions, as he claimed, “on\n                  the other side of this sheet.”Roy P.

On January 3, 1840, Calhoun introduced a bill in the Senate to cede\n                  public lands in new states under certain conditions.  The Illinois House of Representatives\n                  debated and tabled a resolution in support of this bill, with Lincoln voting in favor\n                  of it.

On January 17, 1839, Lincoln, speaking on behalf\n                  of the committee, reported back the resolution with a lengthyreport, together with a set ofresolutions. On February 2, the House then adopted theresolutionsand sent them to the Senate requesting the latter’s concurrence. On March 2, the\n                  Senate concurred with the resolutions.
