        "text": "3Abraham Lincoln’s response, if he penned one, has not been located.James M. McLean would receive the appointment as register of theU.S. General Land Officein Palestine  and hold the position until 1853.Ryan references the contest to see who would replaceRichard M. Youngas commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office.  Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner.  Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.Ryan addresses  Lincoln at Washington, DC, because, as competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19. Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment;\n                  the job went to Butterfield instead.
