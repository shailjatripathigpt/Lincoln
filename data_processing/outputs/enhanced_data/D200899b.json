The following, published from the speech of Hon.Abram LincolnatGalena, and given by theGalena Advertiser, is a true and exact statement of the present standing position of parties in relation\n\nto dissolving the Union of these States. Let every voter read it, and think and act\n\nfor himself: Mr. Lincoln was addressing himself to the opponents ofFremontand theRepublican party,2and had referred to the charge of “sectionalism,” and then spoke something as follows\n\nin relation to another charge, and said— “You further charge us with being Disunionists. If you mean that it is our aim to\n\ndissolve the Union, for myself I answer, that is untrue; for those who act with me\n\nI answer, that is untrue. Have you heard us assert that as our aim? Do you really\n\nbelieve that such is our aim? Do you find it in our platform, our speeches, our conversation,\n\nor anywhere? If not withdraw the chaege. “But, you may say, that though it is not your aim, it will be the result, if we succeed,\n\nand that we are therefore Disunionists in fact. This is a grave charge you make against\n\nus, and we certainly have a right to demand that you specify in what way we are to\n\ndissolve the Union. How are we to effect this? “The only specification offered, is volunteered by Mr.Fillmore, in hisAlbanyspeech. His charge is, that if we elect a President and Vice President both from\n\nthe free States, it will dissolve the Union.3This is open folly. The Constitution provides, that the President and Vice President\n\nof the United States shall be of different States; but says nothing as to the latitude\n\nand longitude of those States.4In1828,Andrew JacksonofTennessee, andJohn C. CalhounofSouth Carolina, were elected President and Vice President, both from slave States; but no one thought\n\nof dissolving the Union then, on that account. In1840,HarrisonofOhio, andTylerofVirginiawere elected. In 1841, Harrison died, and John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency,\n\nandWilliam R. KingofAlabama, was elected acting Vice President by theSenate;5but no one supposed that the Union was in danger. In fact, at the very time Mr.\n\nFillmore uttered this idle charge, the state of things in the United States disproved\n\nit. Mr.PierceofNew Hampshire, and Mr.BrightfromIndiana,— both from free States— are President and Vice President; and the Union stands,\n\nandwillstand.6You do not contend that itoughtto dissolve the Union, and the facts show that itwon’t; therefore, the charge may be dismissed without further consideration. “No other specification is made, and the only one that could be made, is, that the\n\nrestoration of the restriction of ’87, making the United States territory free territory, would dissolve the Union. Gentlemen,\n\nit will require a decided majority to pass such an act. We, the majority, being\n\nable constitutionally to do all that we purpose, would have no desire to dissolve\n\nthe Union.

In this speech, Fillmore criticized the Republican\n                  Party for nominating a presidential and vice-presidential candidate who were both\n                  from free states, claiming that the Republican Party was therefore a “sectional party”\n                  representing only the interests of the free states of the nation. He asserted that\n                  this was dangerous and argued that if the Republican Party gained power it would lead\n                  “inevitably to the destruction” of the nation.Frank H.

        "text": "5Upon the death of William H. Harrison, confusion reigned over a successor.  The U.S.\n                  Constitution was ambiguous over presidential succession, and the judiciary had never\n                  issued an official pronouncement on the issue.  Article two, section one of the Constitution\n                  stated that upon the death of a president, the duties and powers of the office devolved\n                  upon the vice president, so Vice President John Tyler assumed the office of the president.\n                  Tyler’s ascendancy to the presidency left the vice-presidency vacant, leaving theU.S. Senatewithout a president.    Under article one, section three of the Constitution, the\n                  Senate president pro tempore assumed the duties of president of the Senate in the\n                  absence of the vice president.   Since President Tyler had no vice president, this\n                  technically made the president pro tempore of the Senate the acting vice president\n                  of the United States.Thereportin theWeekly Northwestern GazetteidentifiedWillie P. Mangum, not William R. D. King, as the person elected president pro tempore of the Senate\n                  after Tyler assumed the presidency.  Neither account was accurate; Samuel L. Southard\n                  ofNew Jerseysucceeded King as the Senate’s president pro-tempore on March 11, 1841, serving until\n                  May 1842.  Mangum succeeded Southard, serving from May 1842 to March 1845.  In the\n                  absence of a vice president, Southard and Mangum were, in effect, acting vice presidents\n                  of the United States.Norma Lois Peterson,The Presidencies of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler(Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1989), 45-50; U.S. Const. art.

Will you? If not, who are the\n                  disunionists, you or we? We, the majority, would not strive to dissolve the Union;\n                  and if any attempt is made it must be by you, who so loudly stigmatize us as disunionists.\n                  But the Union, in any event,  won’t be dissolved.  We don’t want to dissolve it, and\n                  if you attempt it,we won’t let you.  With the purse and sword, the army and navy and treasury in our hands and at our\n                  command, you couldn’t do it.  This Government  would be very weak, indeed, if a majority,\n                  with a disciplined army and navy, and a well filled treasury, could not preserve itself,\n                  when attacked by an unarmed, undisciplined, unorganized manority."
