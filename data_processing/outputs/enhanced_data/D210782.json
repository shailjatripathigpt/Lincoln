Robinsonin the U.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinois on May 26, 1858.\n                  Lincoln & Herndon had been retained by the St. Louis firm of Anderson, Lamoureux &\n                  Company to sue Greenleaf C. Robinson in an act of assumpsit related to six promissory\n                  notes totaling $2,875.50 which Robinson had failed to pay. The declaration filed by\n                  Lincoln sought $4,000 in damages. Robinson protested that he had paid $450 and the\n                  firm entered a nolle prosequi for one of the notes. The court ruled in favor of Anderson,\n                  Lamoureux & Co. on June 23, 1858, and awarded them $2,665.39, of which Robinson paid\n                  $2,500. The plaintiffs revived the case in 1866 in an effort to obtain the remainder\n                  of the amount due to them, but ultimately dismissed the proceedings.No response to this letter from Lincoln & Herndon to this letter has been located,\n                  nor has any further correspondence by Lincoln & Herndon regarding the case. U.S. Marshal\n                  for the Northern District of Illinois Iram Nye wrote Lincoln & Herndon two letters regarding the case in the spring of 1859.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 26 May 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-05-26; 23 June 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-06-23; Declaration, Document ID: 63131; Judgment Docket, Document ID: 63135; Affidavit,\n                     Document ID: 129270; Letter, Document ID: 121087; Letter, Document ID: 121088,Anderson, Lamoureux & Co. v.
