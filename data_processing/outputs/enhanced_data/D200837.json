Striker, Jr.wrote Lincoln in reference to this bond on both December 15, 1854 and March 5, 1855.\n                  Neither of these letters have been located, but Lincoln mentioned in hisreplyto Sandford, Porter, and Striker, written on the same day as this letter, that they\n                  had enclosed the bond in their letter of December 15. Samuel A. Clift, the obligor,\n                  had made a bond with Pray, the obligee, for $2,000.  Clift had failed to pay the bond,\n                  and Pray had commenced an attachment suit to collect the debt.  Sandford, Porter,\n                  and Striker sent the bond to Lincoln for collection. Lincoln failed to collect the\n                  debt, noting in hisreplyto Sandford, Porter, and Striker that he had been “dabbling in politics”--reference\n                  to his successful bid to win a seat in theU.S. Senate. See the1854 Federal ElectionIn legal parlance, the obligor is a person who makes a bond and promises to perform\n                  some action, and  the obligee is a  person who receives a bond as a promise of something\n                  owed to them. An attachment suit is “an action through which a plaintiff could have\n                  the court seize the defendant’s personal or real property pending the outcome of a\n                  case involving a debt of $20 or more or an out-of-state defendant.”Henry Campbell Black,Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th ed.
