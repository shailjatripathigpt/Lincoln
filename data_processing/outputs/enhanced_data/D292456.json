        "text": "3In the1856 Federal Election,Republicansnominated John C. Fremont as their first presidential candidate, whileDemocratsnominated James Buchanan. TheAmerican Party, in its final participation in a presidential election, nominated Millard Fillmore.\n                  Republicans, concerned that two opposition tickets would favor the Democrats,exploredcampaign strategies to ensure their candidate, Fremont, would be elected. In alettertoJames Berdanin July 1856, Lincoln suggested a possible fusion ticket, bringing together supporters\n                  of the American and Republican parties. In the end, Lincolnimplementeda mail campaign, sending form letters to Fillmore supporters informing them that\n                  every vote for their candidate in Illinois lessened his chance of becoming president.Lincoln and his fellow Republicans failed to convince Fillmore’s supporters to unite,\n                  allowing Democrats to label their opponents as both nativists and worshippers of African\n                  Americans. Lincoln’s prediction proved prophetic. Buchanan won Lawrence County with\n                  54 percent of the vote, with Fillmore coming in second at 39.5 percent. Buchanan also\n                  won Crawford County with 57.1 percent (Fremont second with 28.4), Jasper County with\n                  63.5 percent (Fremont second with 21.8), and Richland County with 62.1 percent (Fillmore\n                  second with 34.8). Fillmore won Wabash County in a very tight race, overtaking Buchanan\n                  44.6 percent to 44.2 percent.  Buchanan captured Illinois with 44.1 percent of the\n                  vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont and 15.7 for Fillmore and became the fifteenth president\n                  of the United States. Indeed, if the votes received by Fremont and Fillmore in Illinois\n                  had been combined, Buchanan’s vote would not have been sufficient to carry the state.Thomas A.
