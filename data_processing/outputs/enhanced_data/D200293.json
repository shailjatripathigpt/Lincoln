Stowell et al., eds.,Papers of Abraham Lincoln: Legal Documents and Cases(Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2008), 1:xxxiv-xxxv.Shelledy’s cases involved petitioning for bankruptcy in federal courts.  In 1841,\n                  theU.S. Congressresponded to thePanic of 1837by passing the first bankruptcy legislation in American history. Beginning on  February\n                  1, 1842, Illinoisans could apply for bankruptcy relief in the U.S. District Court\n                  in Springfield. Logan & Lincoln participated in at least 72 bankruptcy cases during\n                  1842 and 1843. They filed bankruptcy petitions for debtors and their lawyers from\n                  throughout the state, including two for clients who resided inEdgar County, where Shelledy practiced law.“An Act to Establish a Uniform System of Bankruptcy throughout the United States,”\n                     19 August 1841,Statutes at Large of the United States5 (1856):440-49;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 20 May 1842, 1:4; 15 July 1842, 3:5; Daniel W.
