        "text": "1The DemocraticIllinois State Registerpublished this report of Abraham Lincoln’s speech as a letter to the editors from\n                  “Manlius.” No other report on the content of this speech has been located, with the\n                  exception of a brief mention of it in theIllinois State Journal, which described his remarks as “well timed” and having “a most telling effect.”\n                  From July 1856 onwards Lincoln gave over fifty speeches across Illinois in support\n                  of Republican presidential candidate John C. Fremont and to rally the disparate elements\n                  of the emerging Republican Party. See the1856 Federal Election.TheIllinois State Journalalso reported that in this speech Lincoln had contemptuously dismissed a story in\n                  theIllinois State RegisterregardingLyman Trumbull’s election as U.S. Senator in 1855 over Lincoln. This was an apparent reference to\n                  discussion in theIllinois State Registerand other newspapers of an August 1856 speech byJames H. Mathenyat a meeting in Petersburg in support ofAmerican Partypresidential candidateMillard Fillmore. In his speech Matheny asserted that when IllinoisWhigs,Abolitionists,Know Nothings, andanti-NebraskaDemocrats joined together in theelection of 1854to defeat mainstream Democrats, one of their agreements was that a Whig was to be\n                  chosen for theU.S. Senateseat. He argued that this promise was broken when Trumbull’s supporters refused to\n                  elect Lincoln. Matheny was at this time drawing parallels with the efforts of the\n                  emerging Republican Party, members of which he claimed were pressuring Fillmore supporters\n                  to vote for Republican presidential candidate Fremont instead. In the analysis of\n                  theIllinois State Register, both Fillmore and Fremont supporters were scheming to control former Whigs for their\n                  own ends.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:425-33; Franklin William\n                     Scott,Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, vol. 6 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1910), 323;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 September 1856, 2:1;Rock Island Morning Argus(IL), 13 August 1856, 2:3;Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 23 August 1856, 3:1."

It is unclear which Lincoln may have referenced  here. Throughout the 1850s\n                  Lincoln andStephen A.

        "text": "EditorsRegister:On Saturday last ourtownwas honored by the presence of that great high-priest ofabolitionism,Abram Lincoln.  His mission had been foretold by hand-bills, stating that he would “address the\n               people ofMenardupon the important issues of the day.” The curiosity of many of our citizens was\n               naturally aroused, as such a thing as aFremontspeech (which this promised to be) had never been heard in Menard county.  A considerable\n               number, therefore, turned out to hear him, among whom was your correspondent.  I arrived\n               there rather late, for the gentleman had commenced speaking.  As I entered I heard\n               him pronouncing, with thundering emphasis, a beautiful passage fromWebster’scompromisespeech, and that, too,without the quotations.  This was a promising commencement; but it was soon evident that he had read Webster\n               for theletterrather than thespirit.2He then branched off by condemning “the representative system of the south,” and displayed\n                  its alleged evils in every possible, and we may say impossible, manner.  He then fell\n                  back, by spasmodic convulsions, to pronouncing eulogies upon the constitution, hardly remembering that this same “damning representative system of the south” was\n               one of the essential compromises of that constitution, and that this same thing had\n               been the rant and cant of all northern fanatics against the constitution ever since\n               its adoption.3He wished all to read theblack republicanplatform; and, after reading that platform, he wished any man to point out the sectionalism\n                  in it.  There was none.(Let him look at the flag of his country raised upon that platform, with fifteen\n               glorious stars erased from its national constellation, and ask the same question.)4“It was a slander,” he said, “upon the good sense of the southern people to say that if Fremont is elected that\n                  the Union will be divided; that it matters not if both candidates be from free states,”5and here he repeats that which you have satisfactorily answered— that bothpresidentandvice presidentof the United States now are from the free states.6He citedDavid Wilmotas one of his “democratic” authorities; gave a history of a bargain betweenLong John WentworthandPresident Pierce, stating that when theNebraska billwas first proposed, thepresidenthad called him (Wentworth) to his councils in order to find out what he had better\n                  do, and which side he should take, promising, in the meanwhile, that would abide his\n                  (W.’s) decision; that he had broken his word, and taken the other side.  All of this\n                  Lincoln knew to be true, forLong Johnhad told him so! He said that when the Nebraska bill was first proposed, that there\n                  wasnot a maninIllinoisin favor of it.Wonder how they came to be, and who brought about the mighty change, and how was\n               it, if Mr. Lincoln speaks truth, that all thedemocrats, and with four exceptions only, all their opponents, including Mr.O. M. Hatch, Mr. Lincoln’s candidate for secretary of state, voted directly for a resolution\n               in thehouse of representatives of Illinoisin 1851 which indorsed the principles of the Nebraska bill, and how was it that all\n               the democrats, and all their opponents butfour,   in the house of representatives of Illinois, in 1851, instructed our members ofcongressto organize allfutureteritories on those principles, as a continuance of theadjustment of 1850?7He said the democrats “pronounced the declaration of independence a self-evident lie.”8"
