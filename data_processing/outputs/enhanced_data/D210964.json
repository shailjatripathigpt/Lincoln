        "text": "3William Seward, at the time a Senator fromNew York, delivered an anti-slavery speech in Rochester, New York, on October 25, 1858. He\n                  echoed many of Abraham Lincoln’s arguments made in the debates, stating “...the United\n                  States must and will, sooner or later, become entirely a slave-holding nation, or\n                  entirely a free labor nation.” Arguing famously that there was “an irrepressible conflict”\n                  between the slave and free states, he insisted that compromise was doomed to fail,\n                  as compromise was an attempt to meet in the middle of an issue where only one side\n                  could win. He made further claims that the Founding Fathers desired that the United\n                  States become fully free and that their belief was that free labor would eventually\n                  prevail based on their framing of America’s founding documents.The New York Herald(NY), 30 October 1858, 1:6; 2:1-2."

        "text": "4Dewey references the state elections inIllinois, which occurred on November 2, 1858.   Abraham Lincoln, the candidate of theRepublican Party, was challengingStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for seat in theU.S. Senate.   Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat.  See1858 Federal Election;1858 Illinois Republican Convention.In December 1857, Douglas had criticized theLecompton Constitutionand PresidentJames Buchanan’s support of it, causing a rift in the Democratic Party.  Some Republicans in  the\n                  East were excited by Douglas’s repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution to the extent\n                  that they considered supporting his bid for reelection. Although Douglas later denied\n                  it, he courted Republican support—meeting in person with prominent men such as Horace\n                  Greeley and hinting in correspondence with Republicans that he was finished with the\n                  Democratic Party. Lincoln and other Republicans were concerned by these developments\n                  and urged fellow party members to remain loyal in the upcoming election. In Lincoln’s\n                  view, Douglas disagreed with the Buchanan administration over whether the Lecompton\n                  Constitution accurately represented the will of Kansans, but did not repudiate the\n                  overall goal of admittingKansasas a slave state.In the state’s local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly and Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 November 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-50, 458-60, 492-540,\n                     556-57; Allen C.
