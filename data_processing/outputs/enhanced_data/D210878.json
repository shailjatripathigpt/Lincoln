Douglas as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Election. He and Douglas canvassed thestatethroughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for\n                  theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the U.S. Senate race.

In addition,Thomas A. MarshallandRichard J. Oglesbyhad  urged Lincoln to travel to Mattoon to speak and offered him travel and itinerary\n                  advice.Lincoln delivered his addresses in Paris, Illinois,  and in Hillsboro as scheduled\n                  on September 7 and 9, respectively. He also delivered a speech in Mattoon on September\n                  7. TheChicago Daily Press and Tribunereported that more than 1,000 people attended the Mattoon speech, and possibly as\n                  many as 1,500. Lincoln passed through Mattoon again without delivering an address\n                  on September 17, before proceeding toCharleston, Illinoison September 18 for one of his sevendebateswith Douglas.Ultimately, in Illinois’ local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Although Lincoln’s\n                  attempt to unseat Douglas was  unsuccessful, his involvement in thecampaign—particularly theLincoln-Douglas Debates—lifted him to national prominence.Thomas A.
