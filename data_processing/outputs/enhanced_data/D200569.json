        "text": "1The author of the text of this petition is unknown.  Abraham Lincoln and each of the\n                  other signatories signed their own names.The actual date of this petition is uncertain.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, gave it an inferred date of April 1849, without attribution.  Basler’s date is improbable\n                  for several reasons.  Lincoln and his fellowWhigs, hoping to reap patronage rewards from theelectionofZachary Taylorto the presidency in November 1848, were unlikely to recommend Robert Allen, a knownDemocrat, for a position in the new administration.  Lincoln received numerous letters, moreover,\n                  in December 1848, January 1849, and February 1849, endorsingBenjamin Bondfor the job of marshal, and in March 1849, Lincoln added his endorsement, though\n                  he preferred someone else for the job.  In addition, Bond enjoyed the support of a\n                  majority of Democrats in theIllinois General Assembly(Bond would receive the appointment and hold the office until 1853).The editors believe this petition was written and signed not in April 1849 but several\n                  years earlier, most likely between theelectionofJames K. Polkas president in November 1844 and the appointment ofStinson H. Andersonas marshal in April 1845.Lincoln’s comment “If new appointment is made” lends credence to our contention. \n                  Lincoln’s comment suggests that he did not favor appointment of a new marshal, which\n                  implies that the current marshal was politically palatable to Lincoln.  This would\n                  indicate that a new appointment would be made by the Democrats.Political events in the 1840s provide additional corroboration. After the Whigs andWilliam Henry Harrisonswept to the power in thenational  elections of 1840, Whigs moved swiftly to reap a political harvest with  patronage appointments.  In\n                  April 1841, the Harrison administration appointedWilliam S. Prentissas marshal of the District of Illinois.  Prentiss held the job until July 1844, when\n                  PresidentJohn Tylerreplaced him with Thomas M. Hope.     When James K. Polk won the presidency in 1844,\n                  Democrats moved swiftly to remove Hope and other Tyler supporters and replace them\n                  with Democratic loyalists.  Lincoln’s comment and the political context suggests that,\n                  if Hope was to be replaced, he and his fellow attorneys preferred Allen to Anderson\n                  and other Democrats receiving consideration.Roy P.
