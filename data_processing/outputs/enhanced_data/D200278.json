    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to Joshua F. Speed, 19 June 18411 We have had the highest state of excitement here for a week past that our community\n\nhas ever witnessed, and, although the public feeling is now somewhat allayed, the\n\ncurious affair which aroused it, is verry far from being, even yet, cleared of mystery— It would take a quire of paper to give\n\nyou any thing like a full account of it; and I therefore only propose a brief outline.\n\nThe chief personages in the drama, areArchibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered; andArchibald Trailor,Henry Trailor, andWilliam Trailor, supposed to have murdered him. The three Trailors are brothers; the first, Arch:\n\nas you know, lives intown; the second, Henry,livesinClary's Grove, and the third, Wm, inWarren county; and Fisher, the supposedmurderee, being without a family, had made his home with William.TrailorinWarren.On saturday evening, being the 29thMay, Fisher and William came to Henry's,^in a one horse dearborn,3^and there staid over sunday, and on monday all three came to Springfield,^Henry on horseback^and joined Archibald atMyers’ the dutch carpenter—4That evening at supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning. Some ineffectual\n\nsearch was made for him; and on tuesday at 1 o. clock PM. Wm& Henry started home without him. In a day or so Henry and one or two of his Clary\n\nGrove neighbours came back and searched for him again, and advertised his disappearance in the paper.\n\nThe knowledge of the matter thus far, had not been general; and here it dropped entirely\n\ntill about the 10thInstwhenKeysreceived a letter from the Post Master in War<Page 2>ren, stating that Wmhad arrived at home, and was telling a verry mysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which induced\n\nthe community there to suppose that he had been disposed of unfairly— Key’s made this\n\nletter public, which immediately set the whole town and adjoining country agog; and\n\nso it has continued until yesterday. The mass of the People commenced a systematic\n\nsearch for the dead body, whileWickershamwas dispatched to arrest Henry Trailor at theGrove; andJim: Maxey, toWarrento arrest William. On monday last Henry was brought in, and showed an evident inclination\n\nto insinuate that he knew Fisher to be dead and that Arch: & Wmhad killed him. He said he guessed the body could be found inSpring Creekbetween theBeardstownroad bridge & Hickoxes mill.5Away the People swept like a herd of buffaloes, and cut down Hickoxes mill damnolensvolens6, to draw the water out of the pond; and then went up and down, and down and up the\n\ncreek, fishing and raking, and ducking and diving for two days, and after all no dead\n\nbody found. In the mean time a sort of scuffling ground had been found in the brush\n\nin the angle or point where the road leading into the woods past the brewery, and\n\nthe one leading in past the brickyard join. From this scuffle ground, was the sign\n\nof something about the size of a man having been dragged to the edge of the thickewhere it joined the track of some small wheeled carriage which was drawn by one horse,\n\nas shown by the horse tracks.^The carriage track led off towards Spring Creek.^Near this drag trail,DrMerrymanfoundtwohairs, which after a long scientific examination, he pronounced to be triangular human<Page 3>hairs, which term, he says includes within it, the whiskers, the hairs growing under\n\nthe arms and on other parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the\n\nwhiskers, because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in the neighbourhood of the razor's opperations. On thursday last,JimJim: Maxey brought in William Trailor from Warren. On the same day Arch: was arrested\n\nand put in jail. Yesterday (friday) William was put upon his examining trial beforeMayandLavely. Archibald and Henry were^both^present.Lambornprossecuted, andLogan,Baker, andyour humble servant, defended— A great many witnesses were introduced and examined; but I shall only\n\nmention those whose testimony seemed to be the most important. The first of these\n\nwasCapt. Ransdell. He swore, that when William and Henry left Springfield for home on the tuesday before\n\nmentioned, they did not take^the^direct route, which, you know, leads by the butcher shop, but that they followed\n\nthe street North untill they got opposite, or nearly opposite May's new house, after\n\nwhich he could not see them from where he stood; and it was afterwards proven, that\n\nin about an hour after they started, they came into the street by the butcher’s shop\n\nfrom towards the brick yard. DrMerryman & others swore to what is before stated about the scuffle-ground, drag-trail,\n\nwhiskers, and carriage tracks. Henry was then introduced by the prossecution. He swore, that when they started for home, they went out North as Ransdell stated,\n\nand turned down West by the brick yard into the woods, and there met Archibald; that\n\nthey proceeded a small distance further,<Page 4>where he was placed as a sentinel, to watch for, and announce the approach of any\n\none that might happen that way; that William and Arch: took the dearborn out of the\n\nroad a small distance to the edge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw them\n\nlift the body of a man into it;the carriage;that they then moved off with the carriage in the direction of Hickoxes mill, and\n\nhe loitered about for something like an hour, when William returned with the carriage,\n\nbut without Arch: and said that they had puthimin a safe place; that they then went some how, he did not know exactly how, into\n\nthe road close to the brewery, and proceeded on to Clary's Grove. He also stated that\n\nsometime during the day, William told him, that he and Arch: had killed Fisher the\n\nevening before; that the way they did it was byhishim (William) knocking him down with a club, and Arch: then choking him to death.\n\nAn old man from Warren, calledDrGilmore, was then introduced on the part of the defence. He swore that he had known Fisher for several years; that Fisher had resided at\n\nhis house a long time at each of two different spells; once while he built a barn\n\nfor him, and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three\n\nyears ago, Fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since which\n\nhe has been subject to continual bad health, and occasional abberations of mind. He\n\nalso stated that on last tuesday, being the same day that Maxey arrested William Trailor,\n\nhe (the Dr) was from home in the early part of<Page 5>the day, and on his return about 11 o, clock, found Fisher at his house, in bed,\n\nand apparantly verry unwell; that he asked how he had come from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come\n\nbyPeoria, and also told several other other places he had been at not in the direction of Peoria, which showed that he, at the\n\ntime of speaking, did not know where he had been, or that he had been wandering about\n\nin a state of derangement. He further stated that in about two hoursrehe received a note from one of William Trailor's friends, advising him of his arrest,\n\nand requesting him to go on to Springfield as a witness, to testify to the state of\n\nFisher's health in former times; that he immediately set off, catching up two of his\n\nneighbours, as company, and riding all evening and all night overtook Maxey & William atLewistoninFulton county; that Maxey refusing to discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors returned,\n\nand he came on to Springfield. Some question being made whether thedoctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances of his, among whom was the same\n\nPost Master who wrote to Key's as before mentioned, were introduced as sort of compurgators,\n\nwho all swore, that they knew thedoctorbe of good character for truth and veracity, and generally of good character in every\n\nway— Here the testimony ended, and the Trailors were discharged, Arch: and William\n\nexpressing, both in word and manner, their entire confidence<Page 6>that Fisher would be found alive at thedoctor's, by Galaway7,Mallory, and Myers, who a day before had been dispached for that purpose; while Henry still\n\nprotested that no power on earth could ever show Fisher alive— Thus stands this curious\n\naffair now. When thedoctor's story was first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the countenances,\n\nand hear the remarks of those who had been actively engaged in the search for the\n\ndead body. Some looked quizical, some melancholly, and some furiously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he always knew\n\nthe man was not dead, and thathehad not stirred an inch to hunt for him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cuting down Hickoxes mill dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most awfully\n\nwo-begone; he seemed the \"wictimofhunrequitedhaffection\" as represented in the comic almanic we used to laugh over; andHart, the little drayman that hauledMollyhome once,8said it was toodamnedbad, to have so much trouble, and no hanging after all.9 I commenced this letter on yesterday, since which I received yours of the 13th10I stick to my promise to come toLouisville.11Nothing new here except what I have written— I have not seenSarahsince my long trip, and I am going out there as soon as I mail this letter—12",

        "text": "We have had the highest state of excitement here for a week past that our community\n               has ever witnessed, and, although the public feeling is now somewhat allayed, the\n               curious affair which aroused it, is verry far from being, even yet, cleared of mystery— It would take a quire of paper to give\n               you any thing like a full account of it; and I therefore only propose a brief outline.\n               The chief personages in the drama,  areArchibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered; andArchibald Trailor,Henry Trailor, andWilliam Trailor, supposed to have murdered him. The three Trailors are brothers; the first, Arch:\n               as you know, lives intown; the second, Henry,livesinClary's Grove, and the third, Wm, inWarren county; and Fisher, the supposedmurderee, being without a family, had made his home with William.TrailorinWarren.On saturday evening, being the 29thMay, Fisher and William came to Henry's,^in a one horse dearborn,3^and there staid[stayed] over sunday, and on monday all three came to Springfield,^Henry on horseback^and joined Archibald atMyers’ the dutch carpenter—4That evening at supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning. Some ineffectual\n               search was made for him; and on tuesday at 1 o. clock PM. Wm& Henry started home without him. In a day or so Henry and one or two of his Clary\n               Grove neighbours[neighbors] came back and searched for him again, and advertised his disappearance in the paper.\n               The knowledge of the matter thus far, had not been general; and here it dropped entirely\n               till about the 10thInstwhenKeysreceived a letter from the Post Master in War<Page 2>ren, stating that Wmhad arrived at home, and was telling a verry mysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which induced\n               the community there to suppose that he had been disposed of unfairly— Key’s made this\n               letter public, which immediately set the whole town and adjoining country agog; and\n               so it has continued until yesterday. The mass of the People commenced a systematic\n               search for the dead body, whileWickershamwas dispatched to arrest Henry Trailor at theGrove; andJim: Maxey, toWarrento arrest William. On monday last Henry was brought in, and showed an evident inclination\n               to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be dead and that Arch: & Wmhad killed him. He said he guessed the body could be found inSpring Creekbetween theBeardstownroad bridge & Hickoxes mill.5Away the People swept like a herd of buffaloes, and cut down Hickoxes mill damnolensvolens6,  to draw the water out of the pond; and then went up and down, and down and up the\n               creek, fishing and raking, and ducking and diving for two days, and after all no dead\n               body found.  In the mean time a sort of scuffling ground had been found in the brush\n               in the angle or point where the road leading into the woods past the brewery, and\n               the one leading in past the brickyard join. From this scuffle ground, was the sign\n               of something about the size of a man having been dragged to the edge of the thicke[t]where it joined the track of some small wheeled carriage which was drawn by one horse,\n               as shown by the horse tracks.^The carriage track led off towards Spring Creek.^Near this drag trail,DrMerrymanfoundtwohairs, which after a long scientific examination, he pronounced to be triangular human<Page 3>hairs, which term, he says includes within it, the whiskers, the hairs growing under\n               the arms and on other parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the\n               whiskers, because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in the neighbourhood[neighborhood] of the razor's opperations. On thursday last,JimJim: Maxey brought in William Trailor from Warren. On the same day Arch: was arrested\n               and put in jail. Yesterday (friday) William was put upon his examining trial beforeMayandLavely. Archibald and Henry were^both^present.Lambornprossecuted, andLogan,Baker, andyour humble servant, defended— A great many witnesses were introduced and examined; but I shall only\n               mention those whose testimony seemed to be the most important. The first of these\n               wasCapt. Ransdell. He swore, that when William and Henry left Springfield for home on the tuesday before\n               mentioned, they did not take^the^direct route, which, you know, leads by the butcher shop, but that they followed\n               the street North untill they got opposite, or nearly opposite May's new house, after\n               which he could not see them from where he stood; and it was afterwards proven, that\n               in about an hour after they started, they came into the street by the butcher’s shop\n               from towards the brick yard. DrMerryman & others swore to what is before stated about the scuffle-ground, drag-trail,\n               whiskers, and carriage tracks. Henry was then introduced by the prossecution. He swore, that when they started for home, they went out North as Ransdell stated,\n               and turned down West by the brick yard into the woods, and there met Archibald; that\n               they proceeded a small distance further,<Page 4>where he was placed as a sentinel, to watch for, and announce the approach of any\n               one that might happen that way; that William and Arch: took the dearborn out of the\n               road a small distance to the edge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw them\n               lift the body of a man into it;the carriage;that they then moved off with the carriage in the direction of Hickoxes mill, and\n               he loitered about for something like an hour,  when William returned with the carriage,\n               but without Arch: and said that they had puthimin a safe place; that they then went some how, he did not know exactly how, into\n               the road close to the brewery, and proceeded on to Clary's Grove. He also stated that\n               sometime during the day, William told him, that he and Arch: had killed Fisher the\n               evening before; that the way they did it was byhishim (William) knocking him down with a club, and Arch: then choking him to death.\n               An old man from Warren, calledDrGilmore, was then introduced on the part of the defence[defense]. He swore that he had known Fisher for several years; that Fisher had resided at\n               his house a long time at each of two different spells; once while he built a barn\n               for him, and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three\n               years ago, Fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since which\n               he has been subject to continual bad health, and occasional abberations of mind. He\n               also stated that on last tuesday, being the same day that Maxey arrested William Trailor,\n               he (the Dr) was from home in the early part of<Page 5>the day, and on his return about 11 o, clock, found Fisher at his house, in bed,\n               and apparantly verry unwell; that he asked how he had come from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come\n               byPeoria, and also told several other other places he had been at not in the direction of Peoria, which showed that he, at the\n               time of speaking, did not know where he had been, or that he had been wandering about\n               in a state of derangement. He further stated that in about two hoursrehe received a note from one of William Trailor's friends, advising him of his arrest,\n               and requesting him to go on to Springfield as a witness, to testify to the state of\n               Fisher's health in former times; that he immediately set off, catching up two of his\n               neighbours, as company, and riding all evening and all night overtook Maxey & William atLewistoninFulton county; that Maxey refusing to discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors returned,\n               and he came on to Springfield. Some question being made whether thedoctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances of his, among whom was the same\n               Post Master who wrote to Key's as before mentioned, were introduced as sort of compurgators,\n               who all swore, that they knew thedoctorbe of good character for truth and veracity, and generally of good character in every\n               way— Here the testimony ended, and the Trailors were discharged, Arch: and William\n               expressing, both in word and manner, their entire confidence<Page 6>that Fisher would be found alive at thedoctor's, by Galaway7,Mallory, and Myers, who a day before had been dispached for that purpose; while Henry still\n               protested that no power on earth could ever show Fisher alive— Thus stands this curious\n               affair now. When thedoctor's story was first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the countenances,\n               and hear the remarks of those who had been actively engaged in the search for the\n               dead body. Some looked quizical, some melancholly, and some furiously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he always knew\n               the man was not dead, and thathehad not stirred an inch to hunt for him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cuting down Hickoxes mill dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most awfully\n               wo-begone; he seemed the \"wictimofhunrequitedhaffection\"   as represented in the comic almanic we used to laugh over; andHart, the little drayman that hauledMollyhome once,8said it was toodamnedbad, to have so much trouble, and no hanging after all.9"
