    "full_text": "An Old Soldier to the Editors of The Old Soldier, 1 February 1840 To the Editors of theOld Soldier. Gentlemen: I was at thebattle of Tippecanoe, underGen. Harrison, and at thebattle of New Orleans, underGen. Jackson. I knew both of these distinguished individuals intimately—both in war and in peace.\n\nI have already had the pleasure of voting for Gen. Jackson, to fill thehighest stationin the gift of man,three times;first. in1824, secondly in1828and lastly in 1832; and, if I live, my intention is to vote for Gen. Harrison, for the same high station,\n\ninNovember next. A man always acts safely, in voting for Gen. Jackson and Gen. Harrison. In youth\n\nand in age, in war and in peace, their services were ever at their country’s call;\n\nand in all the situations in which their eventful lives have been cast, they were\n\nnever found wanting in the high qualities of mind and heart which adorn the statesman,\n\nthe civilian or the warrior. In hours of soberness and contemplation, I have often contrasted the character of\n\nGen. Jackson with that of Gen. Harrison. The first is a man of the boldest and most\n\nstriking points; more under the influence of feeling, of stronger partialities and\n\nprejudices, and, on some occasions, will suffer his feelings to control his judgment;\n\nuninfluenced by prejudice, his mind is clear and strong, and alwayshonest. To his strong prejudices and feelings, are to be attributed his public acts of doubtful\n\npolicy, and which, by his enemies, have been considered high-handed and arbitrary;\n\nbut, knowing the honesty of his motives, I could always overlook any error of his\n\nadministration, believing it safer to trust a man of his tried patriotism, than another\n\nof more doubtful honesty, altho’ his policy of government, in some points, might better coincide with my own. Gen. Harrison likewise possesses a strong<Page 2>mind, and one that is highly improved by education. He lacks that impulsiveness,\n\nboldness and decision of character, which distinguishes Gen. Jackson; is more prudent;\n\nhowever, always thinks before he acts, on any important subject; and, in his final\n\ndecision, is not so apt to be influenced by partiality or prejudice. Gen. Jackson,\n\nin all places, and in all his associations, shows himself the firm, commanding, military\n\nman. Gen. Harrison, on the contrary, except in his tall and finely proportioned figure,\n\nhas but little of the military air; is modest and retiring in his manners; plain in\n\ndress; fond of reading, the company of his friends, and all agricultural pursuits. As Governor of theNorth West, as delegate and Senator inCongress, as Commande-in-chief of the Northwestern Army, as Minister toColumbia, as the PLAIN FARMER ofOhio, and as thehumble clerkof a county court, he carries the same plain, familiar and unassuming character.\n\nShould he be elected to thehigh stationwhich his friends soon wish to raise him, thirty years’ acquaintance warrants me\n\nin saying he will carry the same amicable and generous character to theWhite House inWashington. In all the situations above named, I have seen and known Gen. Harrison. He was never\n\nvain of promotion, and when his time of service had expired, likeCincinnatus, he sunk into retirement, and assumed the cultivation of his farm with the same cheerfulness\n\nand complaisance that he left it. He is now about sixty-six years of age; grey and war-worn in person, but vigorous\n\nin intellect; poor in fortune, and as clerk of one of the courts inCincinnati, is earning his daily bread. He could have been rich; and when Governor or Indian\n\nAgent ofIndiana, and what is more,Illinois, had frequent offers of property that would have made him and his family wealthy;\n\nbut he always refused, saying he was a public man, and fearing it might be thought\n\nhe was acting for himself, and not for the public; he would never engage in any speculation,\n\nbut honestly and faithfully discharged the high duties of his office. Happy would\n\nour country be, if, in theseswartwouting times, all her offices were filled by such men.1Surrounded, as he was, by all the allurements of speculation, and the certainty\n\nof wealth, with unlimited credit, and thousands of the public money in his pocket,\n\nhe never used improperly one cent, or failed to account, like an honest man, for every\n\nfarthing. Such is the characterof Gen. Harrison.—I care not what his politics are. I know him to behonest, I know him to becapable, and I know him to be a true and a tried friend of his country. Let him be calledfederalist,republican,locofoco,democratorwhig—I care not which—I know he isPatriot, and that the country will be safe in his hands. Then, let every American, every friend of his country, go to the polls in November,\n\nand vote for Gen. Wm. Henry Harrison to be President of these United States. This\n\nis what I shall do, if I live to that day.Mr. Van Burenis a man of talent—Ivoted for him once, when Gen. Harrison was not the ostensible candidate—but he has noclaimsfor services rendered to his country, beyond a thousand more of it, and not to compare\n\nwith Gen. Harrison’s.
