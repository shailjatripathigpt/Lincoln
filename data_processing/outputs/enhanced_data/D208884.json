He had pledged to serve only one term, but many Whigs in the district\n                  favored his renomination. Lincoln was not averse to running again, butStephen T. Loganreceived the party’s nomination. In August 1848, Logan lost to DemocratThomas L. Harrisby a narrow margin.Lincoln was not the last Whig to serve the Seventh Congressional District, however.\n                  At a district convention held inPekin, Illinois, on August 5, 1850, the Whig Party nominatedRichard Yatesof the Seventh Congressional District as its congressional candidate. By leveraging\n                  opposition to theCompromise of 1850to his political advantage, Yates won a narrow victory over Democratic incumbent\n                  Harris.

        "text": "6In November 1849, Lincoln sent the previous secretary of the interior,Thomas Ewing, atelegramrecommending Simeon Francis for appointment as surveyor general of theOregon Territory. Ewingreplied, noting that such a position had not yet been created, but probably would be soon.\n                  PresidentMillard Fillmoreappointed Thomas M. T. McKennan secretary of the interior shortly after the death\n                  of President Taylor. Lincoln likely sent this letter to McKennan to reassert his desire\n                  for Francis to receive the appointment, in the event that the position was created\n                  while McKennan was in office. Lincoln also sent alettertoThomas Corwin, Fillmore’s new secretary of the treasury, on Francis’ behalf, requesting that Corwin\n                  help introduce Francis to McKennan.Prior to recommending Francis for this position, Lincoln had also recommended him\n                  for secretary of the Oregon Territory, a position Taylor awarded Lincoln on August\n                  9, 1849, but which Lincoln declined. Other Illinois Whigs also pressed for Francis\n                  to receive the secretary appointment, but Taylor ultimately appointed Edward Hamilton\n                  ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory.TheU.S. Congressdid not pass legislation creating the office of surveyor general of the Oregon Territory\n                  until September 27, 1850, and the first person appointed to the position was John\n                  B. Preston. Francis’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers\n                  and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently,\n                  he did not receive any other appointment during this period. The 1861 official register\n                  shows Francis worked in Oregon as a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster\n                  for theU.S. Army.  In July 1861, he wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment either, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Sylvia Larson, “McKennan, Thomas McKean Thompson,”American National Biography, ed. by John A.
