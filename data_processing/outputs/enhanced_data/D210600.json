He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.Abraham Lincoln to Hugh Lamaster;William H.

        "text": "3The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate. In the first round of voting, Lincoln received forty-five of\n                  the ninety-nine votes cast, but as no candidate received a majority of votes, several\n                  more rounds of balloting ensued. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining,\n                  Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected.Albert G. Jonesvoted for Lincoln in the first nine ballots and after Lincoln dropped out, voted\n                  for Trumbull.William D. Watsonvoted for Lincoln in the first seven votes then broke for Trumbull in the final\n                  three rounds of voting. Trumbull won a majority of votes in the tenth round and became\n                  Illinois’ next U.S. Senator. See the1854 Federal Election.Victor B.
