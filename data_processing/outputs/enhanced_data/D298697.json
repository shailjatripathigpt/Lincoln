Perleysent a petition to Abraham Lincoln on July 12, 1858, with the signatures of thirty Democrats and\n                  fifty Republicans, inviting him to visit Henry, Illinois. Lincolnagreedon August 3. The invitation stemmed from Lincoln’s recent nomination at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  See1858 Federal Election.Lincoln boarded a train at 3 a.m. on August 23 and arrived in Henry, Illinois, toaddressthe town for several hours on his promised date. This document is Perley’s introduction\n                  to Lincoln’s speech, which he addressed to a crowd that was several thousand strong.Marshall Countywas a northern Illinois county assumed to be strongly Republican in 1858, and that\n                  proved to be the case in the state election of that year. Marshall was in the Eighth\n                  Illinois Senate District, where RepublicanGeorge C. Bestordefeated Democrat William S. Moss, and the Forty-Second Illinois House District,\n                  which elected RepublicanJohn A. McCallover Democrat Washington E. Cook.Allen C.

        "text": "2Each of the named men was opposed to slavery in some form.William H. Sewardhad already become a well-known antislavery politician by the 1850s.Charles Sumner‘s father taught him as a child that slavery was wrong and that the enslaved deserved\n                  freedom, equality, and happiness--a lesson Sumner remembered throughout his life.John P. Halecould not be labeled an abolitionist, but by 1843 he had embraced antislavery to\n                  the point that he voted against the gag rule in theHouse.William P. Fessenden‘s antislavery developed out of his hostility to the slave power subordinating northern\n                  interests.Benjamin F. Wade, in 1854, stated in a speech, “You may call me an Abolitionist, if you will. I care\n                  little for that; for, if an undying hatred to slavery constitutes an Abolitionist,\n                  I am that Abolitionist.”Lyman Trumbullconsidered popular sovereignty to be a sham and believed that the pro-slavery powers\n                  were determined to spread slavery across the United States against the wishes of America’s\n                  founding fathers.Daniel W.
