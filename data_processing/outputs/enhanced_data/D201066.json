        "text": "2John C. BagbywroteLincoln on July 27 asking him to speak in Rushville on August 21, 1858, when theSchuyler Countyconvention gathered to appoint congressional and senatorial delegates to theRepublicanconvention of the Fifth Illinois Congressional District atAugustainHancock Countyon  August 25.  Abraham Lincoln was the Republican candidate forU.S. Senate, so the outcomes of the party convention in Schuyler County and the Fifth Congressional\n                  District were of interest to him.  In the summer and fall of 1858, Lincoln crisscrossed\n                  Illinois delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for\n                  theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to, DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. See1858 Federal Election.As Lincoln notes, he was scheduled to be inOttawa, Illinoisat that time for the firstLincoln-Douglas Debate.  However, Lincoln didspeakat the August 25 convention. That convention nominatedJackson GrimshawofPike CountyforCongress. Bagby was nominated for the EleventhSenateDistrict composed of Hancock,Henderson, and Schuyler counties. On September 6, Lincolnwroteto Bagby emphasizing the necessity of a win. Although Bagby won in Henderson County,\n                  receiving 1,005 votes to hisDemocraticopponentJohn P. Richmond’s 758 votes, Bagby lost in Hancock County 2,031 to 2,340 and in Schuyler County 1,076\n                  to 1,480 votes. All told, Bagby lost the state senate seat to Richmond 4,112 to 4,578\n                  votes.  Richmond voted for Douglas in the U.S. Senate election. In the congressional\n                  race, Grimshaw lost toIsaac N. Morris, the incumbent.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.
