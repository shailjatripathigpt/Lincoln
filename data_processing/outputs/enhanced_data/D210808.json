Douglas in theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858 he crisscrossed Illinois, delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate. The outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere therefore of great importance to Lincoln’s campaign.

This became popularly\n                  known as his “House Divided” speech. Lincoln did not, however, deliver a speech in\n                  Bloomington, Illinois in the summer of 1858. Douglas delivered an address in Bloomington\n                  on July 16, which Lincoln attended, but when members of the audience requested that\n                  Lincoln deliver a reply to Douglas, Lincoln respectfully refused, stating, “This meeting\n                  was called by the friends ofJudge Douglas, and it would be improper for me to address it.” By “Your Bloomington speech,” it\n                  is possible Ray actually meant a speech that Lincoln delivered in Springfield on July\n                  17—the day after Lincoln declined to speak in Bloomington.Lincoln later delivered a speech in Bloomington on September 4.Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 16 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-16; 17 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-17; 4 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-04; Report of Speech at Bloomington, Illinois; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois."
