Whilst thus\n\nabstaining from giving provocation, I have become the object of slander, vituperation\n\nand personal abuse, which were I capable of submitting to, I would prove myself worthy\n\nof the whole of it. In two or three of the last numbers of theSangamo Journal, articles of the most personal nature and calculated to degrade me, have made their\n\nappearance.2On enquiring I was informed by theeditorof that paper, through the medium of my friend,Gen. Whiteside, that you are the author of those articles. This information satisfies me that I\n\nhave become by some means or other, the object of your secret hostility. I will not\n\ntake the trouble of enquiring into the reason of all this, but I will take the liberty\n\nof requiring a full, positive and absolute retraction of all offensive allusions used\n\nby you in these communications, in relation to my private character and standing as\n\na man, as an apology for the insults conveyed in them. This may prevent consequences which no one will regret more than myself.3",

        "text": "2In 1838, theSangamo Journalprinted at least one anonymous letter from the “Lost Township,” the name of which\n                  alluded to political issues caused by the creation of new counties. In 1842, the concept\n                  was revived in a series of letters purporting to be from a woman named “Rebecca” from\n                  the Lost Townships. The first, dated August 10, 1842 and published on August 19, bemoaned\n                  the failure of theState Bank of Illinoisand the subsequent depreciation of its printed paper money. On August 26, 1842, theDemocraticadministration, including State Auditor James Shields, decreed that the state would\n                  not accept its own money as payment for taxes. A widely unpopular decision, it was\n                  lambasted immediately byWhigslike Lincoln, who wrote a secondpseudonymous editorialpurportedly from “Rebecca,” dated August 27. Shields’ offense and Lincoln’s response\n                  to it nearly resulted in a duel between the two men.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 5 May 1838, 2:5; 19 August 1842, 3:1-3; Roy P.
