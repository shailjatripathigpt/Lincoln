        "text": "3Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.Regarding McClure’s political allegiances,Jesse K. DuboiswroteLincoln on November 21 that McClure  \twas “a good and reliable man nothing impur\n                  in his politicks,” and that, “Dulany orStep Archeror some of the boys will make him right.”Fleming R. Paynewroteon December 7, 1854, “We hope you will be elected to the senate of U. S. Mr McClure our representative is a good whig & reliable man. He is anti-Nebraska &ratherdisposedto favor the K-Nothings.”The Illinois General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make\n                  their selection for the state’s U.S. Senator. Thomas R. McClure cast his vote for\n                  Lincoln in all of the first nine rounds of voting. After the ninth vote, with his\n                  share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his remaining\n                  supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. McClure voted for Trumbull\n                  in the tenth round of voting, at which point Trumbull was declared the victor.
