        "text": "3The case Lincoln references wasThomas C. Rockhill & Co. v. Bradford & Brotherin which the Thomas C. Rockhill & Company retained Lincoln & Herndon in 1845 to sue\n                  the partnership of Bradford & Brother to recover a debt of $669.76 and an additional\n                  $500 in damages. The case was heard in U.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinois, and\n                  was decided in 1847 in favor of the plaintiff. Thomas C. Rockhill & Co. was awarded\n                  the amount of the claimed debt and $254.27 in damages.Several of the legal documents associated with this lawsuit identify Thomas H. Rockhill\n                  & Co. as “Thomas H. Rockwell & Co.”  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, adopted this name, citing the case asRockwell et al. v. Bradford,   though the transcription has “Rockhill & Co.” Editors with the Lincoln Legal Papers\n                  kept Basler’s nomenclature, but further research has confirmed that the name of the\n                  firm was indeed Thomas C. Rockhill & Co.  The editors have modified the case name\n                  to reflect this finding.Roy P.
