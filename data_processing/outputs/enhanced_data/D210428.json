Lincoln recommended one of the two to\n                  the Post Office Department, but then he began receiving letters opposing both Stockwell\n                  and Roberts and supportingJohn H.

With Tremonters at odds over which candidate they preferred,\n                  Lincoln was forced to write the Post Office Department and ask that if the appointment\n                  was not already made, to suspend it until the town could unify around one candidate.\n                  Lincoln advised Briggs “to get up a full and fair meeting” of theWhigsand, if he thought fit,Democratsof the area to decide who would become postmaster.Petition of Richard T.
