        "text": "2Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted were those who had moved into theAmerican Partyfollowing the dissolution of the Whig Party.There was also concern by Republicans during the1858 electionthat Douglas would win votes from their party. Douglas criticized theLecompton ConstitutionandJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in theDemocratic Party. Some Republicans were excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution\n                  and although Douglas later denied it, he courted Republican support. Lincoln and other\n                  Republicans were concerned by these developments and urged fellow party members to\n                  remain loyal in the upcoming election.Allen C.
