        "text": "2Fusion tickets were common during thecongressional election of 1854, as disaffectedWhigsandDemocratsbanded together or “fused” withFree Soilers,Nativists, and temperance advocates, often over shared opposition to theKansas-Nebraska Actand the extension of slavery. See the1854 Federal Election.Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee to supplant Democratic incumbentJames Shieldsas U.S. Senator. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to\n                  political allies, including Hoyt, seeking support for his candidacy and information\n                  about his prospects.Lincoln won election to theIllinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854, officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for theU.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.In the election of 1854, the voters ofKaneandDeKalbcounties elected William Patten to theIllinois House of Representatives, placing him in a position to vote upon Illinois’ representative in the U.S. Senate.\n                  In alistof members of the Illinois General Assembly that Lincoln created around January 1855,\n                  he listed Patten as an anti-Nebraska Democrat.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:392-93; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

Young Scammon nor Lincoln won election to the U.S. Senate;\n                  the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Patten did not vote for Lincoln; he cast his ballot forWilliam B. Ogden,Martin P. Sweet, and Trumbull before finally committing to Trumbull in the seventh ballot. Stung\n                  and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public statements\n                  for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his law practice.Charles Hoyt to Abraham Lincoln;Charles Hoyt to Abraham Lincoln; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:401-2; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
