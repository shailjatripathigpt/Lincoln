Fellow Citizens of Illinois:— One of our Representatives, Hon.Robert Smith, has already introduced a bill in Congress for the object embraced in the annexed\n\npetition, and a similar bill has also been introduced byJudge Douglassin the Senate.2It was lost in theHouseat the last session by a trifling majority, after having passed theSenateby a vote of 24 to 11, and it is thought a united effort of the friends of the measure,\n\nwill secure its passage this session. Petitions are being circulated in Eastern and\n\nSouthern States, which have a direct and great interest in the construction of these\n\nroads; and if united among ourselves, we shall surely succeed. The grant is liberal,\n\nbeing six sections of land for each mile of railroad built, to be selected along the\n\nroutes within twenty miles; yet so important are they regarded by all sections of\n\nthe Union, that the bill will be passed if it is not weighed down by other roads. Now is it not the part of wisdom to make sure of this, than run any risk in attempting\n\nto get more? This we can get, and then a precedent is established, which will render\n\nit comparatively easy to procure donations in aid of other roads. Do not let us loose this most valuable gift by disunion among ourselves; or by grasping at too much. These routes are more important to theStateat large than any others, and were purposely left undefined by SenatorsBreeseand Douglass that the whole people might favor the project, and then the Legislature\n\nwill make the location. Let us unite as one man and obtain the grant this present session; and before the\n\nbest of the lands are gone, which are being fast taken with soldiers’ warrants.—We\n\nought to be satisfied with asking in one bill for over two million acres. The undersigned citizens of theState of Illinois, would respectfully pray your Honorable body that a grant of lands\n\nbe made to ourState, to aid in building a railroad from Upper and LowerMississippito Chicago, on the same general terms and conditions of the bill for the same object,\n\nwhich passed the Senate at the last session, by the large vote of twenty-four to eleven. These routes being par excellence, great national thorough-fares, in the construction\n\nof which, all sections of the country have a direct interest, particularly theNortheast, theWest, andSouthwest, and being to ourselves the most important within our borders, so that an\n\nundivided and strong support will be obtained in Congress for them, if left unincumbered by other roads; we would respectfully pray that the passage of the bill be not endangered\n\nby amendments, and that the grant be made liberal to the State as in the former bill,\n\nso as to secure the completion of the roads, and that it be passed the present session,\n\nbefore the best lands have been absorbed by speculators in soldiers’ warrants. And\n\nyour petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.3",
