On January 13, the House struck out 5,000 as the\n                  basis for representation in the House and inserted in lieu thereof 4,500.  The House\n                  further reduced the number to 4,000 by a vote of 47 yeas to 37 nays, with Lincoln\n                  not voting.  The House adopted the Senate resolution as amended by a vote of 47 yeas\n                  to 36 nays, with Lincoln not voting.  On January 14, the Senate rejected the House\n                  amendment by a vote of 12 yeas to 23 nays.  On January 25, the House refused to recede\n                  from its amendment by a vote of 32 yeas to 54 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The\n                  Senate and House created a committee of conference to resolve the disagreeing vote.\n                  On January 28, the conference committee reported back the Senate resolution as amended,\n                  recommending that the Senate adopt the House amendment, and the Senate concurred.\n                  The Senate resolution as amended became the basis for the ratio of representation\n                  found in section one of an apportionmentbillthat becamelawon February 26.
