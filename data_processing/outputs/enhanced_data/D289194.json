He owned slaves himself--though\n                  not while as president. While governor of theIndiana Territory, he worked to suspend theNorthwest Ordinance’s prohibition against slavery. While a member ofCongressfromOhio, he stated that he was opposed to slavery, but in debates over the extension of slavery\n                  to the new states or territories, he sided with pro-slavery Southerners and voted\n                  for extension. In his public speeches during the 1840 campaign, he was purposely ambiguous\n                  regarding slavery in the Southern states, expansion of slavery into new states and\n                  territories, and anti-slavery andabolitionism.Daniel Walker Howe,What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848(New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 137; Michael F.
