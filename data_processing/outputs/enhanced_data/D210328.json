The\n                  action of replevin gave individuals legal remedy for instances of wrongful seizure\n                  of their personal property. After the jury found England guilty of wrongfully taking\n                  the horses, Lincoln prepared this bill of exceptions for an appeal. However, England\n                  paid the court costs and likely returned the animals, and Lincoln never filed an appeal\n                  of the case in theIllinois Supreme Court.Ferguson v.
