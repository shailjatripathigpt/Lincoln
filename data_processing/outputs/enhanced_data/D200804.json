On last night Hon.Abram Lincoln, a distinguished and able statesman and orator of thisState, spoke on theKansas Nebraska billto the citizens of thiplace, at North Market Hall. Although the notice that he would speak was given merely\n\nthrough the papers, the fame and reputation of the orator and the absorbing interest\n\nyet felt here on this subject, drew together a large and intelligent audience. The\n\nHall was filled, and the speaker listened to with attention and approbation.2 His speech of last evening was as thorough an exposition of theNebraskainiquity as has ever been made, and his eloquence greatly impressed all his hearers,\n\nbut it was manifest, as he frequently remarked that “he could not help feeling foolish in answering arguments which were no arguments at\n\nall.”3He could not help feeling silly in beating the air before an intelligent audience.\n\nIt is a fruitless job to pound dry sand, under the delusion that it is a rock. The\n\nlaborer may get his eyes full, but the sand is just as sandy as it was before. It is not at all important that we should give a report of his arguments of Friday\n\nevening— Our readers, those of them who are not already convnced, are not open to conviction, and it is useless to waste any strength upon them.\n\nOne or two of Mr. Lincoln’s points, however, we cannot help referring to. He said\n\nthat he had heard Mr.Douglasargue half an hour to show that there was a necessity of territorial organization\n\nin Nebraska andKansas, as though it was the main point of all his efforts, and as though somebody was actually\n\ngoing to dispute him. It was a great trick among some public speakers to hurl a naked\n\nabsurdity at his audience, with such confidence that they should be puzzled to know\n\nif the speaker didn’t see some point of great magnitude in it which entirely escaped\n\ntheir observation. A neatly varnished sophism would be readily penetrated, but a\n\ngreat, roughnon sequitrwas sometimes twice as dangerous, as a well polished fallacy. In reference to a certain beast who inhabits aneighboring State, thedemocracyof which State sends him to theSenate, of course, Mr.L. said “there was one man inCongress,John Pettit, who had no difficulty in seeing that our Declaration of Independence was a ‘self-evident\n\nlie.’— More than this, he had no hesitation in saying so in a public debate inWashington. The Declaration of Independence was a “self-evident lie.” What would have happened\n\nif he had said it in old Independence Hall? The door-keeper would have taken him by the throat and stopped his rascally breath\n\nawhile, and then have hurled him into the street.”4 Mr. Lincoln coninued his speech until a little after ten o’clock, and returned toUrbannathe next morning, where he was obliged to attend Court.5 We hope Mr. Lincoln will come among us often.
