Presumably, Lincoln requested James’ assistance in gathering letters of recommendation,\n                  although no letter from Lincoln to James with such a request has been located.Originally, only Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office. Lincoln entered\n                  the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.\n                  See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B.
