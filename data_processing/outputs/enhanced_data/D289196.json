    "full_text": "H. Huckleberry to the Editors of The Old Soldier, 9 March 1840 I have been of late much mortified to hear so many different tales respecting the\n\nconduct ofGen. Harrisonat thebattle of Tippecanoe. Some say the Indians chose the place for the encampment the night previous to the\n\nbattle. Some say Harrison acted cowardly by exposing others, thereby securing himself\n\nfrom danger. Some say one thing, and some another; and most I believe is said by\n\nthose who do not know whether what they say be true or false. As to the charge of\n\nthe Indians selecting the encampment, I pronounce it to be false; the encampment was\n\nselected by a couple of officers sent by Gen. Harrison; and as far as my knowledge\n\nextends a better one could not be found to repel an Indian foe.—It was elevated, nearly\n\nsurrounded by open prairie, and a sufficiency of wood. On the charge of Gen. Harrison’s\n\nattempting to shun danger, he appeared to me to expose himself unnecessarily,—wherever\n\ndanger was, there was he encouraging his men. My own opinion was then, and is now,\n\nthat his daring conduct, was the great stimulous to officers and men, which alone prevented a disaster similar to the one known asSt. Clair’s defeat.1The Indians rushed to the charge with all the fury of demons; his presence every\n\nwhere completely roused the solider in every man—ne flagged or faltered, though many fell. Thme spirit that animated the commander-iief, by his daring feats, was caught by hen, and all appeared determined to conqudie. I have long been an observer o\n\nold General’s conduct, in the field and in tuncils of the nation, and will say that he in every instance acquitted himself with hoand to the interest of his country.2",

The\n                  rout, the greatest military defeat of an U.S. force by Native Americans in history,\n                  became known by a number of names, including “St. Clair’s Defeat.”Gregory Evans Dowd, “St. Clair, Arthur,\"American National Biography, ed. by John A.

Charges\n                  of cowardice at Tippecanoe were easily refuted, but Harrison did make mistakes before\n                  and during the battle, including not fortifying the American encampment.Gail Collins,William Henry Harrison(New York: Times Books, 2012), 109-10."
