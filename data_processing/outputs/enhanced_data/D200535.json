        "text": "2After spending September 1848 on a speaking tour ofMassachusetts, Lincoln returned toIllinoisin October 1848, and spent most of the month canvassing his congressional district\n                  on behalf ofZachary Taylor.  Lincoln was in Springfield onelection dayand several other days in November.  He left Springfield for Washington in late November.On January 22, 1842, Thomas C. Browne gave Speed a promissory note for $318.57, bearing\n                  interest at 12 percent. Speed apparently retainedLogan & Lincolnto collect the debt and left the promissory note in their custody. During this time,\n                  following thePanic of 1837, hard currency was scarce; Browne likely wanted to pay in State of Illinois auditor’s\n                  warrants because he could not put together the necessary hard currency to pay the\n                  debt. In 1844, Logan & Lincoln  forwarded to Speed auditor’s warrants from Browne\n                  totaling $318. In April 1848, Speed wrote Herndon requesting that Logan & Lincoln\n                  pay the remaining $86 or turn over to him the promissory note.Speed asked Lincoln & Herndon to collect debt, Martha L.
