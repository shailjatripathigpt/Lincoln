        "text": "2Lincoln references the Republican Party's strategy to unseat Stephen A. Douglas as\n                  U.S. senator in the1858 Federal Election.  In December 1857, Douglas spoke out against theLecompton Constitutionand criticized PresidentJames Buchananfor supporting it. This led to a rift in the Democratic Party between pro-Douglas\n                  and pro-Buchanan factions, leaving Douglas vulnerable to a Republican candidate or\n                  a pro-Buchanan candidate either running alone or  in alliance with the Republicans.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445."

        "text": "3Hurbut representedBoone Countyand Lincoln representedSangamon Countyat the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.In his originalletterto Lincoln, Hurlbut had suggested that members of the old Whig Party leaned toward\n                  supporting Lincoln’s candidacy for the U.S. Senate while the old Democratic ranks\n                  that had become Republicans leaned toward Douglas.  Despite Lincoln's confidence,\n                  some Republicans were excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution\n                  to the extent that they considered supporting his bid for reelection. Although Douglas\n                  later denied it, he courted Republican support—meeting in person with prominent men\n                  such asHorace Greeleyand hinting in correspondence to Republicans that he was finished with the Democratic\n                  Party. Lincoln and other Republicans were concerned by these developments and urged\n                  fellow party members to remain loyal in the upcoming election.Greeley and other editors of Republican newspapers in the East continued to back Douglas,\n                  but the rank and file Republicans in refused to follow suit.   Republican conventions\n                  were held in 100 counties ofIllinoisto choose delegates to the state convention, and ninety-five of them passed resolutions\n                  supporting Lincoln for U.S. Senate.  Delegates to the state convention unanimously\n                  nominated Lincoln to run against Douglas.  Lincoln’s attempt to unseat Douglas did\n                  not prove successful, but his involvement in the campaign, particularly theLincoln-Douglas Debates, lifted Lincoln to national prominence.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:3;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 23 June 1858, 2:7;Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 14 June 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445-50, 457-58, 547."
