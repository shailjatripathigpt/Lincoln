Douglasand Sidney Breese to get Congress to grant Illinois a right of way and a grant of\n                  public land to build a railroad between Chicago and Cairo.  On January 13, 1848, Douglas\n                  presented a petition from citizens of the state requesting a grant of land to aid\n                  in building a railroad.  On January 20, Douglas introducedSenate Bill No. 95(S. 95)--the bill that Butterfield references.  The Senate referredS. 95to the Committee on Public Lands, of which Breese was the chairman.  Breese, on behalf\n                  of the committee, reported back the bill on January 24 without amendment.  The Senate\n                  ordered the bill and accompanying report printed.  Meanwhile, on February 15 and 23,\n                  respectively, Breese and Douglas presented additional petitions from citizens of Illinois\n                  requesting congressional assistance in constructing the railroad.  Over in the House,\n                  Abraham Lincoln presented a similar petition on February 14.Illinois’ congressional delegation in the Thirtieth Congress included:William A. Richardson,John A. McClernand,Robert Smith,Thomas J. Turner,John Wentworth, and Lincoln, in the House; and Breese and Douglas in the Senate.John M.

In December 1848, Smith introduced a similarbillin the House, but it did not pass.  In January 1849, the Senate passed a similarbill, but the House took no action before the end of the session.  In September 1850,\n                  Congress finally passed a law making a grant of land and granting the right of way\n                  for a railroad--this railroad running from Chicago toMobile, Alabama.
