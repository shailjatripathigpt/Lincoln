One thing with which I am\n\nmuch delighted, is, that you have so strictly adhered to the promise made in your\n\nprospectus; that is, “to spread before the people a knowledge of facts.” Facts are\n\nstubborn things; and facts, known to be such by every body, are very stubborn things. It is a well authenticated fact, thatGen. Harrisonis ademocrat, “dyed in the wool,” of the old Jeffersonian school, and that he has served his country\n\nin the field and in its councils for more than forty years, without reproach, and\n\n“that he has done more for the entire west than any man living.” It is fact, that our veneratedWashington, Presidents J. Adams,Jefferson.MadisonandJ. Q. Adams, all reposed the most unlimited confidence in him, as a man of capacity and sterling\n\nintegrity:—and manifested such confidence by appointing and elevating him in the military\n\ndepartment from Ensign to Major General, in theUnited States army, and in the civil from a territorial Secretary to Governor and Foreign Minister. It is a fact, that the Legislatures ofIndianaandKentucky, and theCongressof the United States, did severally pass resolutions, approbating in the strongest\n\nterms, General Harrison’s conduct, as a prudent, wise and able General in thelast war. And whatever political demagogues may say to the contrary notwithstanding, it is\n\nnevertheless a fact, that in addition to the resolutions referred to, we have the\n\nimpaial opinions of many of our first military men,—who shared with him the toils of war,\n\nand who were eye-witnesses to his deeds of valor, who declare, that in their judgment\n\nhe possesses military talents of the highest order—such men, too, asCol. Croghan,Richard M. Johnson,Gov. Shelby,Commodore Perry, and a host of others too numerous to mention. It is a fact, that the people have had such confidence in the good sense, honesty\n\nand patriotism ofOld Tip, that they have again and again called upon him to serve them in the State Legislature\n\nand also in Congress, both as representative and senator. And it is an undoubted fact, that the Old Soldiers, their sons (and their daughters,\n\ntoo, if they were allowed to vote,) the poor men and log cabin boys, have determined,\n\nnext November to send the Old Hero up to the White House atWashington, in honor of the many and valuable services he has rendered his country. These are\n\nall facts, known to be such by every man acquainted with the times and history of\n\nthe country. There are a great many Old Soldiers scattered all over these lands,\n\nwho have fought under General Harrison, and you might as well talk to theseven stars and orion1, as tell them he is not, one of the bravest men that ever lived, and one of the best\n\nqualified men for the Presidency of the United States. The more that is said against\n\nhim, the warmer they wax in his favor. They know him, and they know more;—they know\n\nthey never sawMartin Van Burenencountall the dangers of the battle-field, nor have they to this day ever heard, that a\n\ndeed so honorable had marked any period of his life. But they have heard that whileOld Tippecanoewith the hardy sons of the west, the real log cabin class, was camped in the field\n\nor ranging our frontiers, fighting our battles, defending our women and children from\n\nthe murderous tomahawk and scalping knife, and adding new lusture to the American name with his splendid victories; they have heard, I say, that about,\n\nor just before this time Mr. Van Buren was voting for thefederalanti-warcandidate, and against oldJames Madison, thedemocraticwar candidate for President. And that he was in theNew York Legislature, voting forRufus King, the federal anti-war candidate for Senator. Now, the query with some is, if he\n\nwas opposed to the war candidate for President and Senator, was he not opposed to\n\nthe war? and if opposed to the war, was he, or was he not a federalist? How then\n\ncame he to be a democrat? We know it is not absolutely necessary to brave the dangers\n\nof war, in order to be a democrat—but then we know that every man, who opposed the\n\nlast war, was considered a federalist. Neither do we feel disposed to charge Mr.\n\nVan Buren with cowardice—as he was opposed to the war. we presume he felt no disposition to expose himself to danger. But the question\n\noccurs again, how came he to be a democrat.2 Now, we have heard it said, (upon what authority we know not) that shortly after the\n\nwar was declared, and Madison elected President the second time, finding democracy\n\nrather popular, all of a sudden he became a democrat. And it is added, that such\n\nwas the tremendous revolution in his principles, that he took a most decided stand\n\nagainst all distinctions on account of color, and actually voted in the New York Convention\n\nfor free negroes to have the right of suffrage.3But then it is contended, that he is now a northern man with southern principles.\n\nAll those things we have heard; but as yet we have no evidence as to the time and\n\ncircumstances under which Mr. Van Buren left the Federal party, and became a democrat.\n\nAnd as hisSub-Treasurydoctrines are substantially federal; many of us doubt whether his heart has ever\n\nbeen changed—we verily believe, he is, as he always was, a Federalist, deeply “dyed\n\nin the wool.” Messrs. Editors, if you please, do him entire justice; but do tell us two things— 1st, Where he was, and what he was doing while our beloved Harrison was achieving\n\nthe celebrated victories ofTippecanoe and the Thames? 2d, When he left the Federal party, and became a democrat, &c.—we want proof and not rumor. These questions are propounded, because some men, born long sinceSolomon, have asserted, that Old Tippecanoe has no claims to the Presidency, founded upon\n\nservices rendered his country.—While we can see nothing in his history from the age\n\nof 19 to 60, but noble deeds, and such deeds as entitle him not only to our confidence,\n\nbut to our votes as President. And on the other hand, there is not, in our opinion\n\na single thing in the whole history of Martin Van Buren, that should entitle him to\n\nthe vote of one Western man. If he has ever done any thing for us, we want to know\n\nit.",

But he, like\n                  other Northern Republicans, broke with Madison in the1812 electionand voted for dissident Democratic-RepublicanDeWitt Clinton, who opposed the war and had the support of the Federalist Party.  Van Buren immediately\n                  abandoned Clinton after his loss, causing the two to become bitter rivals for control\n                  of the Democratic-Republican party inNew York.  The final break between the two came over the election of a U.S. Senator in 1813:\n                  Van Buren, seeking to ingratiate himself with regular Republicans, voted for the Republican\n                  candidate, but  King won the election, despite the Republican-controlled legislature.\n                  Van Buren accused Clinton and his followers of abandoning the party to repay the Federalists\n                  for their support in the presidential election.  By 1819, Van Buren and King were\n                  friendly and united by their mutual distrust of Clinton, and Van Buren and his faction\n                  cooperated with the Federalists to get King re-elected.Van Buren’s opponents after the War of 1812 regularly condemned him for his reluctance\n                  to join the fighting--he turned down the offer of a military commission--and for not\n                  doing enough in theNew York Senateto support the war effort.  In point of fact, Van Buren was a War Hawk who crafted\n                  and shepherded through many pieces of war legislation, included the raising of troops.\n                  In September 1814, he authored a radical measure allowing the governor to conscript\n                  12,000 men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five to defend the state. The New\n                  York Legislature passed the bill, but the war ended before it could become operational.Donald B.
