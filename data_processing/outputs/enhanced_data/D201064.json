        "text": "2In June 1858, theIllinois Republican ConventionnominatedAbraham Lincolnto challengeStephen A. Douglasfor theU.S. Senate. Lincoln wrote Douglas on July 24 inviting him to participate in aseries of debates. That invitation set the stage for what would become one of the most famous local\n                  political contests in U.S. history and a precursor to the1860 presidential election. Prior to the seven debates between Lincoln and Douglas, Lincoln had already made\n                  sixty-three speeches in 1858, and Douglas claimed to have made 130. Douglas, the incumbentU.S. SenatorfromIllinois, was more widely known than Lincoln and had the numeric advantage of theDemocratsin theGeneral Assembly. He also represented a divided party and faced a growing population in northern Illinois\n                  that was hostile to slavery. Lincoln, on the other hand, had the advantage of a unitedRepublicanparty, a growing antipathy toward slavery in the state, and a reputation for integrity.\n                  Nevertheless, his views on racial issues were unpopular, as was his stand on theMexican War. The debates would highlight the fundamental differences in the men’s characters\n                  and focus on the main issues of the day, the expansion of slavery and racial equality.\n                  While the immediate effect of the debates was the reelection of Douglas, the long-term\n                  results were the opposite. Lincoln was catapulted to national prominence, allowing\n                  him to run for president in 1860, and Douglas’s campaign against Lincoln diminished\n                  his chances of future success. See1860 Republican National Convention.Douglasrepliedto Lincoln’s invitation on the same day, July 24, agreeing to the debates as long\n                  as they were held at times and locations chosen by Douglas.

The split occurred after Douglas, in December 1857, spoke\n                  out against theLecompton Constitutionand criticized President Buchanan for supporting it. SeeBleeding Kansas.\n                  This accusation of Douglas that Lincoln had found a Buchanan/National Democratic candidate\n                  and would insist on his inclusion in the proposed debates was pure fiction. A rumor\n                  of the possibility of the candidacy ofSidney Breesedid appear in several Republican newspapers, but Lincoln had no connection to the\n                  idea. Understandably, Douglas was actively trying to avoid being labeled a coward,\n                  as the RepublicanChicago Daily Press and Tribuneseemed primed to do. In their July 26 edition, thePresseditors noted that such debates between political opponents, “is the usual, almost\n                  universal western style of conducting a political campaign, and it has been justly\n                  held that the candidate who refused to speak in that way had no better reason than\n                  cowardice for declining the challenge.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445, 484;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 21 July 1858, 1:7;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 26 July 1858, 1:1; 4 August 1858, 2:5."
