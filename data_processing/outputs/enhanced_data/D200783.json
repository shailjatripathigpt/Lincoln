The best framed and best administered governments are necessarily expensive;\n\nwhile by errors in frame and maladministration most of them are more onerous than\n\nthey need be, and some of them very oppressive. Why, then, should we have government?\n\nWhy not each individual take to himself the whole fruit of his labor, without having\n\nany of it taxed away, in services, corn, or money? Why not take just so much land\n\nas he can cultivate with his own hands, without buying it of any one? The legitimate object of government is “to do<Page 2>for the people what needs to be done, but which they can not, by individual effort, do at all, or do so well, for themselves.” There are many\n\nsuch things— some of them exist independently of the injustice in the world. Making\n\nand maintaining roads, bridges, and the like; providing for the helpless young and\n\nafflicted; common schools; and disposing of deceased men’s property, are instances. But a far larger class of objects springs from the injustice of men. If one people\n\nwill make war upon another, it is a necessity with that other to unite and coöperate\n\nfor defense. Hence the military department. If some men will kill, or beat, or constrain\n\nothers, or despoil them of property, by force, fraud, or noncompliance with contracts,\n\nit is a common object with peaceful and just men to prevent it. Hence the criminal\n\nand civil departments.",
