See the1854 Federal Election.

        "text": "3“Maine Law” became a popular term for pro-temperance legislation after, in 1846, Maine\n                  became the first U.S. state to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors.During the election of 1854, fusion tickets became common, as disaffected Whigs and\n                  Democrats banded together withFree Soilers,Nativists, and temperance advocates. See the1854 Federal Election. Maine’s legislature obtained a fusionist majority during the election, and elected\n                  fusionist candidate Anson P. Morrill governor. In March 1855, the legislature passed\n                  a new law that significantly toughened enforcement of existing temperance legislation.\n                  It permitted citizens to lodge complaints against those suspected of violating the\n                  law, and allowed judges use such complaints to issue search warrants for private homes\n                  and businesses. The law also made possession of liquor evidence of intent to violate\n                  the law, thus shifting the burden of proof from the state to prove the accused’s guilt\n                  to individuals to prove their innocence. This legislation proved controversial and\n                  unpopular among numerous constituencies.In 1855, Morrill ran for reelection as the candidate of the state’s newly-created\n                  Republican Party, which remained dependent upon support from a variety of political\n                  coalitions—including fusionist Democrats. As Gidding notes above, Maine’s Democrats\n                  were unwilling to emphasize issues other than temperance during the election. Hard-line\n                  Democrats in Maine, also called Pierce Democrats, launched a political strategy in\n                  which they avoided topics that aided the fusionist cause—namely, the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and the issue of slavery—and instead focused their campaign on the fusionists’\n                  new, unpopular temperance legislation.  This strategy was a success, resulting in\n                  striking defeats for Maine’s new Republican Party. Democrats won an overwhelming majority\n                  in theMaine Senateand Morrill lost his bid for reelection to Pierce Democrat Samuel Wells, leading\n                  some to fear that the Republican Party’s losses in Maine might hinder the so-called\n                  “Republican movement” not just in that state, but throughout the nation.Henry S. Clubb,The Maine Liquor Law(New York: Fowler and Wells, 1856), 72-87;New-York Daily Times(NY), 13 September 1854, 1:1; 18 September 1855, 1:6; “An Act for the Suppression\n                     of Drinking Houses and Tippling Shops,” 16 March 1855,Public Laws of the State of Maine(1855),      166-92; Lee D.

Talcott et al., which commenced on September 20.  He departed home forSpringfield, Illinoison Wednesday, September 26—the very day Giddings had invited him to attend the meeting\n                  in Jacksonville, Illinois with he, Archibald Williams, and Richard Yates.By October 4, Giddings and Codding had lectured in seventeen Illinois counties. Although\n                  their campaign was received more enthusiastically in northern Illinois than in the\n                  central and southern sections of the state, it led to calls for a statewide Republican\n                  Party convention and was deemed a success. Giddings’ efforts to enlist Lincoln’s support\n                  for and public commitment to the new Republican Party, however, were less successful.\n                  Lincoln remained committed to the Whig Party throughout 1855.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 20 September 1855,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1855-09-20; 26 September 1855,http://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1855-09-26.
