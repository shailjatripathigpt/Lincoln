Passage of\n                  theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into the congressional\n                  election campaign in the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first).  As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.As Jones notes, Lincoln won a seat in the Illinois General Assembly. Per article three,\n                  section seven of the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

Watson and McClure cast their votes for Lincoln until the eighth and ninth\n                  ballots, respectively, when they switched to Trumbull.  McClain voted forJames Shields, the incumbent, until the seventh ballot, when he shifted his allegiance toJoel A. Matteson.  See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:401-2; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln, 185; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
