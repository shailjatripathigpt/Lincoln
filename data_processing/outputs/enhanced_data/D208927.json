        "text": "3PresidentZachary TaylorhadappointedLincoln secretary of theOregon TerritoryAugust 9, 1849, less than a month after he appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln the position of  secretary of\n                  the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. In aletterto Secretary of StateJohn M. Claytondated August 21, 1849, Lincoln declined the appointment for secretary of the Oregon\n                  Territory and recommended Francis for the position instead.Lincoln also wrote Clayton aletterSeptember 16, 1849 and aletterSeptember 27, 1849, reiterating his endorsement of Francis for secretary of the Oregon\n                  Territory. Francis’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers\n                  and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently,\n                  he did not receive an appointment during this period. The 1861 official register shows\n                  Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment either, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849);Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1855(Washington, DC: A.

In this letter to Clayton, Lincoln enclosed\n                  a recommendationletterfor Fellows fromOrville H. Browningand others.Lincoln wrote Minshall anotherletterrelated to this topic September 17, 1849. In the end, President Taylor appointed\n                  Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory. Fellows’ name does not appear in the official\n                  registers for the officers and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, and 1853,\n                  so apparently, he did not receive any other appointment.On September 20, 1849, in a final effort to ease any tensions caused by Butterfield’s\n                  appointment, the Taylor administration also offered Lincoln appointment as governor\n                  of the Oregon Territory. After serious consideration of this offer, Lincoln also turned\n                  this position down, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849, 250;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851;Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:307."
