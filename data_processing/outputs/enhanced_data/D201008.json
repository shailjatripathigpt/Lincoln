Lincoln and other Republicans were concerned by these developments and urged\n                  fellow party members to remain loyal in the upcomingelection. In Lincoln’s view, Douglas disagreed with the Buchanan administration over whether\n                  the Lecompton Constitution accurately represented the will of Kansans, but did not\n                  repudiate the overall goal of admittingKansasas a slave state.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445-50"
