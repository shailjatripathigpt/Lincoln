Whitneyalso wrote Lincoln informing him of theDaily Chicago Times’ attacks on his congressional record related to theMexican Warand asked him to supply a response. Lincolnrepliedto Whitney on June 24 andrepliedto Medill on June 25, but no reply to this letter from Scripps has been located.\n                  In hisreplyto Medill, Lincoln supplied detailed information to counter theDaily Chicago Times’ attack.Although Lincoln opposed the Mexican War and questioned its constitutionality during\n                  his time in theU.S. House of Representatives, he nevertheless voted in favor of supplies for U.S. troops on at least two occasions:\n                  February 17 and March 8, 1848. In both instances, the bills Lincoln voted for passed\n                  theU.S. Senateand became law, funneling aid in the form of money, food, clothing, medical supplies,\n                  and the like to U.S. military personnel serving in Mexico.TheChicago Daily Tribunepublished a general defense of Lincoln in its June 24 edition, while also admitting\n                  that the editors did not then know whether Lincoln “did or not vote against that war.”\n                  TheDaily Illinois State Journalpublished a refutation of theDaily Chicago Times’ attack on Lincoln in its June 25 edition, and theChicago Daily Tribuneprinted a more thorough refutation of the attack in its June 26 issue.Joseph Medill to Abraham Lincoln;Henry C.

        "text": "4James W. Sheahan was a strong ally of Stephen A. Douglas during theelection campaign of 1858and was known to employ less than scrupulous tactics to support Douglas’ bid for\n                  reelection to the U.S. Senate. Lincoln was running against Douglas as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for the U.S. Senate.Lincoln and Scripps exchanged at least two other letters regarding the1858 Federal Electionprior to this letter.Despite publication of the facts surrounding Lincoln's voting record in the U.S. House\n                  in the Illinois press as early as June 25, 1858—including by Democratic newspapers—Douglas\n                  repeated theDaily Chicago Times's claims throughout the election campaign. In speeches he delivered during the campaign,\n                  including during theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln repeatedly refuted the charges and cited congressional records to back up\n                  his voting record in the U.S. House.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-DouglasDemocratsretained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:458, 467, 554-56;John L.
