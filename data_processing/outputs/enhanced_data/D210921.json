        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln was running against incumbent senator Stephen A. Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf ofRepublicancandidates for the General Assembly. He and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts\n                  on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  See1858 Federal Election.Between the date of Harmon’s August 23, 1858letteraddressed  to Lincoln in Springfield and this letter, Lincoln had only been home\n                  in Springfield briefly on September 1, having been on the campaign trail.Allen C.

BeckwithandWilliam Fithian, Lincolnrespondedto Fithian with the request that Fithian share that response with Beckwith and Harmon.\n                  Lincoln informed the men in his letter to Fithian that having found it beneficial\n                  to make campaign appearances in locations the day after  Douglas had spoken there,\n                  he had scheduled a speech in Danville on September 22, to follow Douglas’ speech scheduled\n                  there on September 21.In Illinois’s local elections of 1858, Republicans ultimately won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-DouglasDemocratsretained control of the Illinois General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the\n                  U.S. Senate.  Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Hiram W.
