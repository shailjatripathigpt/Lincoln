    "full_text": "Fragments of Notes regarding a Tariff Discussion, 1 Whether the protective policy shall be finally abandoned, is now the question– Discussion and experience already had; and question now in greater dispute than ever– Has there not been some great error in the mode of discussion?– Propose a single issue\n\nof fact, namely– \"From 1816 to the present, have protected articlesst us more, of labour, during thehigher, than during thelowerduties upon them?\" Introduce the evidence– Analize this issue, and try to show that it embraces thetrueand the whole question of the protective policy– Intended as a test ofexperience– Theperiodseclected, is fair; because it is a period of peace—a period sufficiently long to furnish a\n\nfair average under all other causes operating on prices—a period in which various\n\nmodifications of higher and lower duties have occured– Protectedarticles, only are embrad– Show thattheseonly, belong to the question– Thelabourprice, only is embraced– Show this to be correct– In the early days of the world, the Almighty said to the first of our race \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread2, and since then, if we except thelight, and theairof heaven, no good thing has been, or can be enjoyed by us without having first cost\n\nlabour– And, inasmuch asall^most^good things are produced by labour, it follows that all such things of right belong to those whose labour has produced them– But it has so happened in all ages of the world, thatsomehave laboured, andothershave,anywithout labour, enjoyed a large proportion of the fruits– This is wrong, and should not continue–\n\nToure to each labourer the whole product of his labour, or as nearly as possible, is a most worthy object of any good government–ut then the question arises, how can a government best effect this?object?– In our own country, in it's present condition, will the protective principleaid^advance^or^retard^injurethis object?That is the question– Upon this subject,^the habits of^our whole species fall into three great classes—usefullabourers,uselesslabourers, andidleness– Of these, the firstnly is meritorious; and to it all the products of labour rightfully belong; but the two latter, while they exist, are heavy pensioners upon\n\nthe first, robbing it of a large portion of its just rights– The only remedy for this\n\nis to, as far as possible, driveuselesslabolabour andidlenessout of existence– And first, as to useless labour– Before making war upon this, we must learn to distinguish it from theuseful– It appears to me, then, that all labour donedirectlyandincendentallyincarryingarticles to their place of consumption, which could have been produced in sufficient\n\nabundance,withaslittlelabour,attheplaceofconsumption, as at the place they were carried from, is usellabour– Let us take a few examples of the application of theown country– Iron^& every thing made of iron^can be produced, in sufficient abundanceth as little labour, in the United States, as any where else in theld; therefore, all labour done in bringing iron^& it’s fabrics^from foreign countries to the United States, is useless labour– The same preciselyCotten, Wool, and of their fabrics respectively, as wellarticles– While the uselessness of the carrying labour is of all the articles mentioned, and of many others not menit is, perhaps, more glaringly obvious in relation to the purchase from abroad– The raw cotten, from which they aregrows in our own country, is carried by land and by water to there spun, wove, dyed, stamped &c; and then carried back and worn in the very country where it grew, and partly by the persons who grew it– Why should it not be spun, wove &c in the very neighbourhood where it both grows and is consumed, and the carrying^labour^thereby dispensed with? Has nature interposed any obstacles? Are not all the agents—animal\n\npower, water power, and steam power— as goodabundant here as elsewhere? Will not as small an amount of human labour, answer here as elsewhere? We may easily see that the cost of this useless<Page 4>labour is very heavy– It includes, not only the cost of theland and water^actual^carriage, but also the insurances of every kind, and the profits the merchants through\n\nwhose hands it passes– All these create a heavy burthen, necessarily falling upon\n\nthe useful labour connected wisuch articles, eitherdepressingthe price to theproducer, orenhancingit to theconsumer, or, what is more probable, doing both in partA supposed case, will serve to illustrate several points now to the ppose– A. in the interior ofSouth Carolina, has one hundred pounds of cotten, which we suppose to be the precise product of one mans labour for twenty days; B, inManchester, England, has one hundred yards of cotten cloth, the precise product of the same amount of lab– This lot of cotten, and lot of cloth are precisely equal to each other in their intrinsic value– But\n\nA. wishes to part withis cotten for the largest quantity of cloth he can get; B, alwishes to part with his cloth for the greatest quantity of cohe can get– An exchange is therefore necessary; but before this can be effected,\n\nthe cotten must be carried to Manchester, and the cloth to South Carolina– The cotten starts to Manchester, the man that hauls^it^ toCharelestonin his waggon, takes a little of it out, to pay him for his trouble; the merchant, who stores it\n\na while before the ship is ready to sail, takes a little out, for his trouble, the\n\nship-owner, who carries it across the water,willtakes a little out for his trouble, still before it gets to Manchester, it is tolled\n\ntwo or three times more for drayage, storage, commission, and so on; so that when\n\nit reaches B's hands there are but seventyfive pounds of it left– The cloth, too, in it's transit from Manchester to South Carolinatogoes through the same process of tolling, so that when it reaches A there are but\n\nseventyfive yards of it– Now, in this case, A. and B. have each parted with twenty days labour, and each received but fifteen in return– But now let us suppose that B. has removed\n\nto the side of A's farm in South Carolina and has there made his lot of cloth– Is\n\nit not clear that he and A. can then exchange their cloth & cotten, each getting thewholeof what the other parts with– This supposed case shows the utter uselessness of the carrying labour in all similarand also, the direct burthen it imposes upuseful labour– Andwill take up the train of reflection sugested by this case, andit out to the full extent of it's just application, will beatthe amount of useless labour will thus discover to bethis very way– I am mistaken, if it is not in fact many times equal to all the real want in the world–Those engaged in thiswould have turnedThis useless labour I would have discontinued, and those engageditin it, added to the class of useful labourers– If II would destroy all commerce, I answer \"Certainly not\"– I wouldit where it isnecessary, anddiscontinueit, where it is not– An instance I would continue commerce, so far as it is employedI would discontinue it so far as it is employed incotten goods– First, then, as to useless labour– But what is useless labour? I suppose, then, that all labour donedirectlyandincidentallyin carrying articles from the place of their production to adistantplace for consumption, which articles, could be produced of as good quality, and\n\nsufficient quantity, with as little labour at the place of consumption, as at the place carried from, is useless labour– Applying this principle to our own countryan example, let us suppose that A and B are aPennlvaniafarmer, and a Pennsylvania iron-maker, whose landse adjoining– Under the protective policy A is furnishing B. with bread and meat,\n\nand vegetables and fruits, and food for horses and oxen, and fresh supplies of horses\n\nand oxen themselves occasionly, and receiving, in exchange, all the iron, iron utensils, tools and implements he\n\nneeds– In this process of exchange, each receives thewholeof what the other partsith– But the change comes– The protective policy is abandoned (how, and under what\n\nexpection, I will hereafter try to show) and A. determines,tofor the future, to buy his supply of iron and iron fabrics of C an iron-maker inEngland– This he can only do by adirector anindirectexchange of the products of his farm for them– The direct exchange is supposed to\n\nbe adopted– In a certain instance of this sort, A desires to exchange ten barrels\n\nof flour, the precise product of one hundred days labour, for the greatest quantity of iron he can get; C, also wishes to exchange the precise\n\nproduct of one hundred days labour, in iron, for the greatest quantity of flour he can get– But before the exchange\n\ncan take place, the flour must becarried^from Penna^to England and the iron^from England^to Pennsylvania– The flour starts– The waggoner who hauls it toPhiladelphia, takes a part of it to pay him for his labour; then a merchant there, takes a little more for storage and forwarding commission;\n\nand another takes a little more for insurance; and then the ship-owner carries it\n\nacross the water, and takes a little more of it for his trouble; still before it reaches\n\nC, it is tolled two or three times more for storage, drayage, commission and so on;\n\nso that when C gets it there are but seven barrels and a half of it left– The iron,\n\ntoo, in it's transit<Page 6>from England to Pensylvania, goes through the same process of tolling; so that when it reaches A, there are but\n\nthree quarters of it left– Now, this carrying labour, was generally useless in this; that it diminished thequantity, while it added nothing to thequalityof the articles carried; and it was useless to A, because, by continuing to buy of\n\nB, it needed not to be done3 make the articlesas to useless labour.–4Before proceeding however, it may be as well to give a specimen of what I coeive to be useless labour– I say, then, that allcarrying^& incidents of carrying,^of articles from the place of their production, to adistantplace for consumption, which articles could be produced of as good quality; in sufficient\n\nquantity, and with as little labour, at the place of consumption, as at the place carried from, is useless labour– Applying this principle to our own country by an example, let us suppose that A\n\nand B, are a Pensylvania farmer, and a Pennsylvania iron-maker, whose lands are adjoining– Under the protective\n\npolicy A is furnishing B with bread and meat, and vegetables, and fruits, and food\n\nfor horses and oxen, and fresh supplies of horses and oxthemselves occasionally, and receiving, in exchange, all the iron, iron utensils,\n\ntools, and implements he needs– In this process of exchange, each receives thewholeof that which the other parts with– and the reward of labour between them is perfect; each receiving the produce of just so much labour, as he has himself bestowed on what he parts with for it– But the change comes– The\n\nprotective policy is abandoned, and A determines to buy his iron and iron manufactures^of C.^inEurope– This he can only do by a direct or an indirect exchange of the produce of his farm\n\nfor them– We will suppose the direct exchange is adopted– In this A desires to exchange\n\nten barrels of flour the precise product of one hundred days labour, for the largest quantity of iron &c that he can get; C, also wishes to exchange the precise product, in iron, of one\n\nhundred days labour, for the greatest quantity of flour he can get–^In intrinsic value, the things to be so exchanged, are precisely equal–^But before this exchange can take place, the flour must be carried from Pennsylvania\n\nto England, and the iron form England to Pennsylvania– The flour starts; the waggoner who hauls it to Philadelphia, takes a part of it to pay him for his labours; then a merchant there takes a little more for storage and forwarding commission,\n\nand another takes a little more for insurance; and then the ship-owner carries it\n\nacross the water, and takes a little more of it for his trouble; still before it reachesB.C. it is tolled two or three times more for storage, drayage, commission and so on,\n\nso that when C.Bgets it, there are butfive^seven & a half^barrels of it left– The iron, too, in its transit from England to Pennagoes through the same processtolling, so that when it reaches A, there is buthalf^three quarters^of it left–<Page 8>The result of this case is, that A and CBhave each parted with one hundred days labour, and each received but seventy five in return– That the carrying in this case, was\n\nintroduced by A ceasing to buy of B, and turning C; that itis^was^utterly useless; and that it is ruinous in its effects, upon A, are all little less\n\nthan self evident– \"But\" asks one \"if A is now only getting three quarters as much\n\niron from C^for ten barrels of flour^as he used to get of B, why does he not turn back to B\"?\" The answer is, B has quit\n\nmaking iron, and so, has none to sell– \"But why did B quit making?\"– Because A quit\n\nbuying of him, and he had no other customer to sell to– \"But surely A. did not cease\n\nbuying of B, with theexpectationof buying of C on harder terms?–\" Certainly not– Let me tell you how that was– When\n\nB was making iron as well as C, B had butonecustomer, this farmer A– C hadfourcustomers in Europe– It seems to be an opinion, very generally entertained, that the condition of a nationor an individual, isbest, wheverthey^it^canbuycheapest; but this is not necessarily true; because if, at the same time, and by the same\n\ncause, it is compelled tosellcorrespondingly cheap, nothing is gained– Then, it is said, the best condition is,\n\nwhen we canbuycheapest, andselldearest; but this again, is not necessarily true; because, with both these, we might have\n\nscarcely any thing to sell—or, which is the same thing, to buy with– To illustrate\n\nthis, suppose a man in the present state of things is labouring the year round, at ten dollars per month, which amounts in the year to $120—a change\n\nin affairs enables him to buy supplies at half the former price, to get fifty dollars\n\nper month for his labour; but at the same time deprives him of employment during all the months of the year\n\nbut one– In this case, though goods have fallen one half, and labourraised^risen^five to one, it is still plain, that at the end of the year, the labourerwould^is^betwenty dollars poorer, than under the old state of things– These reflections show, that to reason and act correctly on this subject, we must\n\nlook not merely tobuyingcheap, nor yet to buying cheepandselling dear; but also to having constant employment, so that we may have the largest\n\npossible amount of something to sell– This matter of employment can only be secured\n\nby an ample, steady, and certain market, to sell the products of labour in– But let us yield the point, and admit that, by abandoning the protective policy, our\n\nfarmers can purchase their supplies of manufactured articlescheaperthan by continuing it; and then let us see whether, even at that, they will, upon\n\nthe whole, be gainers by the change– To simplify this question, let us suppose the\n\nwhole agricultural interest of the country to be in the hands of one man, who has\n\none hundred labourers in hmploy the whole manufacturing interest, to be in the hands ofother man, who has twenty labourers in his employ– The farmers all the plough and pasture land, and the manufacturer, all the iron-mines, and coal-banks,\n\nand sites of water power– Each is pushing on in his own way, and obtaining supplies\n\nfrom thether so far as he needs—that is, the manufacturer, is buying of the farmer all the\n\ncotten he can use in his cotten factory, all the wool he can use in his woollen establishment, all the bread and\n\nmeat, as well as all the fruits and vegetables which are necessary for himself and\n\nall his hands in all his departments; all the corn, and oats, and hay, which are necessary\n\nfor all his horses and oxen, as well as fresh supplies of horses and oxen themselves,\n\nto^do^all his heavy hauling aboutiron works and generally of every sort– The farmer, in turn, is buyof the manufacturer all the iron, iron tools, wooden tools, cotten goods woolen goods &c &c. that he needsfobusiness and for his hands– But after awhile fer discovers that, were it not for the protective policy, he could buy all these supplies\n\ncheaper from a European manufacturer, owing to the fact that the price of labour is only one quarter is high there as here– He and his hands aremajority of the whole, and therefore have the legal and moral right to have their\n\ninterestestfirst consulted– They throw off the protective policy, and farmer ceases buying of\n\nhome manufacturer– Verry soon, however, he discovers, that tobuy, even at the cheaper rate, requires something to buy with, and some how or other,\n\nhe is falling short in this particular– But let us yield the point, and admit that, by abandoning to protective policy, our\n\nfarmers can purchase their supplies of manufactured articlescheaperthan before; and then let us see whether, even at that, the farmers will, upon the\n\nwhole, be gainers by the change– To simplify this question, let us suppose our whole\n\npopulation to consist of but twenty men– Under the prevalence of the protective policy,\n\nfifteen of these are farmers, one is a miller, one manufactures iron, one, implements\n\nfrom iron, one cotten goods, and one woolen goods– The farmers discover, that, owing to labour only costing one quarterinas much in Europe as here, they can buy iron, iron implements, cotten goods & woolen goods cheaper, when brought from Europe,an when made by their neighbours– They are the majority, andrefore have both the legal and moral right to have their inst first consulted– They throw off the protective policy,cease buying these articles of their neighbours– But theyn discover that to buy, even at the cheaper rate, requiresething to buy with– Falling short in this particular, one ofese farmers,sttakes a load of wheat to the miller, andets it made into flour, and starts, as had been his cusm, to the iron furnace; he approaches the well known spot,t strange to say, all is cold and still as death—nooke rises, no furnace roars, no anvil rings– After some search,e finds the owner of the desolate place, and calls out to him, \"Come Vulcan, dont you want to buy a load of flour?–\" \"Why\" says Vulcan \"I am hungry enough, to be sure—have'nt tasted bread for a week—but then you see my works are stopped, and I have nothing\n\nto give for your flour– But, Vulcan, why dont you go to work and get somethingI am ready to do so; will you hire me, farmer? OhI could only set you to raising wheat, and you see I have more of that already than\n\nI can get any thing for– But give me employment, and send your flour to Europe market– Why, Vulcan, how silly you talk– Dont you know they raise wheat in Erope as well as here, and thatlabouris so cheap there as to fix the price of flour there so low, asscarclscarcely to pay the long carriage of it from here, leaving nothing whatever to me–\n\nBut, farmer, could'nt you pay to raise and prepare garden stuffs, and fruits, such as radishes, cabages, irish and sweet potatoes, cucumbers water melons and musk-melons, plumbs, pears,\n\npeaches, apples, and the like; all these are good things and used to sell well– So\n\nthey did use to sell well, but it was toyouwe sold them, and now<Page 14>you tell us you have nothing to buy with– Of course I can not sell such things to\n\nthe other farmers, because each of them raises enough for himself, and, in fact, rather\n\nwishes to sell than to buy– Neither can I send^them^to Europe for a market; because, to say nothing of Eropean markets being stocked with such articles at lower prices than I can afford, they\n\nare of such a nature as to rot before they could reach there– The truth is, Vulcan,\n\nI am compelled to quit raising these things altogether, except a few for my own use,\n\nand this leaves part of my own time idle on my hands, instead of my finding employment\n\nfor you–5 I suppose the true effect of duties upon prices to be as follows: If a^certain^duty be levied upon an article which, by nature can not be produced in this country,\n\nas three cents a pound upon Coffee, the effect will be, that the consumer will pay\n\none cent more per pound than before, the producer will take one cent less, and the\n\nmerchant one cent less in profits—in other words, the burthen of the duty will distributed\n\nover consumption, production, and Commerce, and not confined to either– But if a duty^amounting to full protection^be levied upon an article which can be produced here with as little labour, as elsewhere,^as iron,^that article will ultimately, and at no distant day, in consequence of such duty,\n\nbe sold to our people cheaper than before, at least by the amount of the cost ofcarryingit from abroad– If at any time alllabourshould cease, and all existing provisions be equally divided among the people, at\n\nthe end of a single year there could scarcely be one human being left alive—all would\n\nhave perished by want of subsistence– So again, if upon such division, all thatsortof labour, which produces provisions, should cease, and each individual should take up so much\n\nof his share as he could, and carry it continually around his habitation, although\n\nin this carrying, the amount of labour going on might be as great as ever, so long as it could last, at the end of the year\n\nthe result would be precisely the same—that is, none would be left living– The first of these propositions shows, that universalidlenewould speedily result in universalruin; and the second shows,atuselesslabouris, in this respect, the same as idleness– I submit, then, whether it does not follow, thatpartialidleness, and partialuselesslabour, would, in the proportion of their extent, in like manner result, in partial ruin—whether,\n\nifallshould subsist upon the labour thatone halfshould perform, it would not result in very scanty allowance to the whole– Believing that these propositions, and theI draw from them can not be successfully controverted, I, for the present, assume\n\ntheir correctness, and proceed to try to show, that the abandonment of the protective\n\npolicy by the American Government, must result in the increase of both useless labour, and idleness; and so, in protion, must produce want and ruin among our people–",

      "policy A is furnishing B with bread and meat, and vegetables, and fruits, and food",

      "protective policy is abandoned, and A determines to buy his iron and iron manufactures^of C.^inEurope– This he can only do by a direct or an indirect exchange of the produce of his farm",

      "but one– In this case, though goods have fallen one half, and labourraised^risen^five to one, it is still plain, that at the end of the year, the labourerwould^is^betwenty dollars poorer, than under the old state of things– These reflections show, that to reason and act correctly on this subject, we must",

      "I can get any thing for– But give me employment, and send your flour to Europe market– Why, Vulcan, how silly you talk– Dont you know they raise wheat in Erope as well as here, and thatlabouris so cheap there as to fix the price of flour there so low, asscarclscarcely to pay the long carriage of it from here, leaving nothing whatever to me–",
      "But, farmer, could'nt you pay to raise and prepare garden stuffs, and fruits, such as radishes, cabages, irish and sweet potatoes, cucumbers water melons and musk-melons, plumbs, pears,",
      "peaches, apples, and the like; all these are good things and used to sell well– So",

      "are of such a nature as to rot before they could reach there– The truth is, Vulcan,",
      "I am compelled to quit raising these things altogether, except a few for my own use,",
      "and this leaves part of my own time idle on my hands, instead of my finding employment",
      "for you–5 I suppose the true effect of duties upon prices to be as follows: If a^certain^duty be levied upon an article which, by nature can not be produced in this country,",
      "as three cents a pound upon Coffee, the effect will be, that the consumer will pay",
      "one cent more per pound than before, the producer will take one cent less, and the",
      "merchant one cent less in profits—in other words, the burthen of the duty will distributed",
      "over consumption, production, and Commerce, and not confined to either– But if a duty^amounting to full protection^be levied upon an article which can be produced here with as little labour, as elsewhere,^as iron,^that article will ultimately, and at no distant day, in consequence of such duty,",
      "be sold to our people cheaper than before, at least by the amount of the cost ofcarryingit from abroad– If at any time alllabourshould cease, and all existing provisions be equally divided among the people, at",
      "the end of a single year there could scarcely be one human being left alive—all would",
      "have perished by want of subsistence– So again, if upon such division, all thatsortof labour, which produces provisions, should cease, and each individual should take up so much",
      "of his share as he could, and carry it continually around his habitation, although",
      "in this carrying, the amount of labour going on might be as great as ever, so long as it could last, at the end of the year",
      "the result would be precisely the same—that is, none would be left living– The first of these propositions shows, that universalidlenewould speedily result in universalruin; and the second shows,atuselesslabouris, in this respect, the same as idleness– I submit, then, whether it does not follow, thatpartialidleness, and partialuselesslabour, would, in the proportion of their extent, in like manner result, in partial ruin—whether,",
      "ifallshould subsist upon the labour thatone halfshould perform, it would not result in very scanty allowance to the whole– Believing that these propositions, and theI draw from them can not be successfully controverted, I, for the present, assume",
      "their correctness, and proceed to try to show, that the abandonment of the protective",
      "policy by the American Government, must result in the increase of both useless labour, and idleness; and so, in protion, must produce want and ruin among our people–"

        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote these fragments. According to his endorsement on the last page,\n                  these fragments were written between Lincoln’s election to theU.S. House of Representativeson August 3, 1846, and the beginning of his first term on December 6, 1847.In his list of “The Carpet Bag Papers,” John Nicolay described these fragments as\n                  “Eleven foolscap halfsheets of notes and memoranda with two endorsements”: one in\n                  Lincoln’s hand on the last page of these fragments, and another in John M. Hay’s handwriting\n                  related toNotes on What General Taylor Ought to Say. Nicolay writes that these scraps were enclosed in an envelope addressed toDavid Davisunder the frank of SenatorSimon Cameron.Aggregators of Lincoln manuscripts and editors of Lincoln editions have arranged these\n                  fragments differently.John NicolayandJohn Hayarranged and printed a draft of these fragments in volume one of theirComplete Works of Abraham Lincoln.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, printed the same draft, following the order of arrangement used by Nicolay and Hay.\n                  The draft in the Papers of Abraham Lincoln Online  at the Library of Congress has\n                  a far different order of arrangement, in addition to an additional fragment in Lincoln’s\n                  handwriting.  Basler notes the existence of this fragment, but chose not to include\n                  it in his text, instead quoting it verbatim in a footnote.The editors have decided to edit and publish the  Library of Congress draft.  When\n                  we first transcribed the document, we followed the order of arrangement used by the\n                  Library of Congress.  Upon further review, we adopted our own order closer to, but\n                  not entirely mimicking, Basler’s arrangement.Dating these fragments remains uncertain.    The first page of the draft at the Library\n                  of Congress includes the notation: “[1847, Dec 1?] Lincoln Speech or Article on Protection.”\n                  Neither Nicolay nor Hay wrote these words, but they dated the document as December\n                  1, 1847 with a question mark.  Basler kept the date subscribed by Nicolay and Hay,\n                  noting, however, that Lincoln’s own parenthetical note at the end indicated that the\n                  fragments were not all written at the same time.  Utilizing Lincoln’s parenthetical\n                  comment, the editors believe Lincoln penned these fragments sometime between his election\n                  to the U.S. House of Representatives on August 3, 1846, and the beginning of his first\n                  term on December 6, 1847.The fragments in the Library of Congress draft are torn and faded in many places,\n                  making the text illegible.  Where possible, the editors have supplied text from the\n                  transcription inThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln.John G.

In a\n                  letter to Lincoln dated August 1, 1860, Cameron notes that Lincoln had shownJames Lesley, Jr., some notes of speeches made during thepresidential campaign of 1844on the subject of tariffs and protection, Lesley’s account of which   “gratifies\n                  us, all, very much.”   Although Cameron dates these notes as 1844, Lincoln dates them\n                  between his election to Congress and the taking of his seat.  In his response to Cameron dated August 6, Lincoln wrote that Davis had probably already called on\n                  Cameron and shown him the “scraps” mentioned by Lesley.  “Nothing about these,” Lincoln\n                  wrote, “must get into the news-papers.”Abraham Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln papers: Series 1.

Has nature interposed any obstacles? Are not all the agents—animal\n               power, water power, and steam power— as good[and as]abundant here as elsewhere? Will not as small an amount of human labour, answer here as elsewhere? We may easily see that the cost of this useless<Page 4>labour is very heavy– It includes, not only the cost of theland and water^actual^carriage, but also the insurances of every kind, and the profits the merchants through\n               whose hands it passes– All these create a heavy burthen, necessarily falling upon\n               the useful labour connected wi[th]such articles, eitherdepressingthe price to theproducer, orenhancingit to theconsumer, or, what is more probable, doing both in partA supposed case, will serve to illustrate several points now to the p[ur]pose– A. in the interior ofSouth Carolina, has one hundred pounds of cotten, which we suppose to be the precise product of one mans labour for twenty days; B, inManchester, England, has one hundred yards of cotten cloth, the precise product of the same amount of lab[our]– This lot of cotten, and lot of cloth are precisely equal to each other in their intrinsic value– But\n               A. wishes to part wit[h]his cotten for the largest quantity of cloth he can get; B, al[so]wishes to part with his cloth for the greatest quantity of co[tton]he can get– An exchange is therefore necessary; but before this can be effected,\n               the cotten must be carried to Manchester, and the cloth to South Carolina– The cotten starts to Manchester, the man that hauls^it^[...?] toCharelestonin his waggon, takes a little of it out, to pay him for his trouble; the merchant, who stores it\n               a while before the ship is ready to sail, takes a little out, for his trouble, the\n               ship-owner, who carries it across the water,willtakes a little out for his trouble, still before it gets to Manchester, it is tolled\n               two or three times more for drayage, storage, commission, and so on; so that when\n               it reaches B's hands there are but seventyfive pounds of it left– The cloth, too, in it's transit from Manchester to South Carolinatogoes through the same process of tolling, so that when it reaches A there are but\n               seventyfive yards of it– Now, in this case, A. and B. have each parted with twenty days labour, and each received but fifteen in return– But now let us suppose that B. has removed\n               to the side of A's farm in South Carolina and has there made his lot of cloth– Is\n               it not clear that he and A. can then exchange their cloth & cotten, each getting thewholeof what the other parts with–"
