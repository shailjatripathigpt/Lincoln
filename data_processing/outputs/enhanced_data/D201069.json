        "text": "2Jediah F. AlexanderwroteLincoln on July 23 asking him to speak in Greenville, Illinois, on August 4 to counter\n                  the scheduled speech that day ofStephen A. Douglas. Lincoln was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate, running against Douglas, theDemocratincumbent. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches\n                  and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Early in the campaign, Lincoln followed Douglas on the stump, delivering speeches\n                  either later in the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. Both Republicans\n                  and Democrats criticized this strategy, and it was of particular irritation to Douglas.\n                  Lincoln had invited Douglas to aseries of debateson July 24. Douglas’sresponse, published in theIllinois State Journalon July 29, offered several excuses to avoid the request, including his already scheduled\n                  speeches. Douglas wrote, “These appointments have all been made for Democratic meetings\n                  and arrangements have been made by which the Democratic Candidates forCongress, for theLegislatureand other offices will be present and address the people. It is evident, therefore,\n                  that these various candidates, in connection with myself, will occupy the whole time\n                  of the day and evening and leave no opportunity for other speeches.\"    In hisresponseaccepting Douglas's terms for the debates, Lincoln promised to no longer be at any\n                  more of Douglas's \"exclusive meetings.\"  In addition to Alexander, Lincoln wrote Republicans\n                  in other localities announcing that he would not present at the times of Douglas's\n                  visits.  Douglas’s published schedule included a visit to Greenville on Wednesday,\n                  August 4.Alexander had alsoinvitedLincoln to Greenville on May 1, to which Lincolnrespondedon May 15 declining that invitation as well. Alexander was among the delegates representingBond Countyat the Republican State Convention.Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A. Douglas;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A. Douglas;Stephen A.
