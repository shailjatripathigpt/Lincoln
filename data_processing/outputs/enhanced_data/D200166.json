Later that same day, the committee\n                  reported back the bill with these amendments, penned byAbraham Lincoln.  The House adopted his first amendment moving Ogle County from the Sixth to the\n                  Ninth Judicial Circuit, but rejected the second and third amendments by a vote of\n                  13 yeas to 52 nays, with Lincoln voting yea. These two failed amendments would have\n                  switched the names of the First and Eighth Judicial Circuits, making Lincoln’s home\n                  circuit, where he lived and practiced law,  the First Judicial Circuit. The amendment\n                  moving Ogle County would become part of theactthat became law.Illinois HouseJournal.  1838. 11th G.
