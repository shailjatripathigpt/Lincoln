In 1841, the partners retainedLogan & Lincolnto sue John Lockridge for payment of a $294.43 debt. On March 28, 1842, the court\n                  ruled for Bell & Co., awarding $312.09 in damages.

If a defendant failed to redeem his property,\n                  any of his judgment creditors were authorized to redeem the property under the same\n                  conditions, within fifteen months of the original sale.“An Act concerning Judgments and Executions,” 17 January 1825,Laws of Illinois(1825), 151-60;James Bell & Co. v.

Van Bergen\n                  then assigned the promissory note to Speed. At the November 1842 term of theSangamon County Circuit Court, Logan & Lincoln brought suit against Walters to foreclose the mortgage. Walters\n                  failed to appear, and the court ruled for VanBergen and Speed, awarding $1,155 in\n                  damages.
