InThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Roy P.

The slip of paper  was affixed with wax over the original Section 13\n                  and was included in the  original draft of the bill that Lincoln reported from the\n                  select committee into the House. Lincoln’s section has  since become separated.  The\n                  document is damaged in places; supplied text comes fromCollected Works.On December 11, 1835, Abraham  Lincoln  introduced aresolutionin the House of Representatives to appoint a select committee of five to inquire\n                  into incorporating a company to construct a canal in the  Sangamon River valley. The\n                  House approved the resolution and appointed Lincoln to the committee.  On December\n                  12, Lincoln, reporting on behalf of the select committee, introduced the bill in the\n                  House, with one section in his handwriting. On December 15, the House referred the\n                  bill to a select committee, of which Lincoln was a member. On December 16, the select\n                  committee reported back the bill without amendment and the House passed the bill.\n                  On December 18, theSenatepassed the bill unamended.
