Lincoln spoke on September\n                  22 and wrote the following day from Danville, “We had a fine and altogether satisfactory meeting\n                  here yesterday.”Marshall, aRepublican, was the  successful candidate  vying for theIllinois Senatein 1858 from the counties ofColes, Cumberland,EdgarandVermilion.Because theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in theU.S. Senateat this time, the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand Illinois Senate were important to Abraham Lincoln, whose was running  against\n                  incumbentDemocratStephen A.
