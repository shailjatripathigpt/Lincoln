The IllinoisRepublican Partyhad run a full slate of candidates in the state and federal elections of 1858 and\n                  was deep in debt in the aftermath of the election campaign. Judd asked Lincoln for\n                  help in raising money to alleviate that debt in aletterto Lincoln on the 15th of November, stating “I am in a worse situation than any one\n                  else– I ran  the State committee upon the least economical plan, and it  has unpaid\n                  bill to the amount of about $2500.”    Lincoln  was among the Republican candidates\n                  for election, having run againstStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for theU.S. Senate.  This bill was for races for candidates at both the state and federal level, only\n                  a portion of it would have been used to aid Lincoln’s campaign.

He had closed out his\n                  last case before the campaign earlier that day when theSangamon County Circuit Courtdismissed  the  divorce case ofCaldwell v. Caldwell. He would not finish his campaign until his final speech of the election season atDecaturon November 1, 1858, the day before election day. With the exception of writing the\n                  defendant’s answer inMershon v. Oliver and Milner, Lincoln put his legal work, and his income, on pause during the campaign, missing\n                  the fall sessions of the courts of theEighth Judicial CircuitandIllinois Supreme Court.    Lincoln took a short break after the election campaign before resuming his legal\n                  work on November 6.Harry E. Pratt,The Personal Finances of Abraham Lincoln, 105-6;Caldwell v.

According\n                  to stories that began circulating in the American press as early as 1839, the phrase\n                  rose out of an Eastern monarch asking wise men to compose a saying that would apply\n                  to all situations.  Lincoln would popularize the adage in his 1859 speech to the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society.Ralph Keyes,The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When(New York: St. Martin’s Griffin, 2006), 159-60;  Report of Speech to the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society; Report of Speech to the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society."
