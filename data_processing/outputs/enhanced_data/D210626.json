Kett, 1877), 380;Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 2 January 1855, 2:3.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. His\n                  December 5 letter to Whitney was likely on this topic.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate.

On January\n                  2, representatives electedThomas J. Turnerspeaker. On January 3, Turner appointed Lawrence to the Illinois House’s Committee\n                  on Education as well as its Committee on Elections. On January 9, Turner also appointed\n                  Lawrence to the Illinois House’s Select Committee on Census.Despite Whitney’s assurances in this letter, as Lincoln laternotedin a letter toElihu B. Washburne, Lawrence never spoke out in support of him for U.S. Senator. Ultimately, Lincoln\n                  did not win election to the U.S. Senate. When it met in joint session on February\n                  8, 1855, the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Lawrence voted for Lincoln in the first three rounds of balloting, then\n                  voted forMartin P. Sweetonce andWilliam B. Ogdenfour times before supporting Trumbull in the final two rounds. See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.List of Members of the Illinois Legislature in 1855;Robert Boal to Abraham Lincoln; Illinois HouseJournal. 1855. 19th G.
