        "text": "3Yates is referring to the upcoming election of Illinois’ next U.S. Senator by theIllinois General Assembly, in which Abraham Lincoln was a candidate. The other main contenders in the race\n                  were James Shields,Lyman Trumbull, andJoel A. Matteson.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. He\n                  won a seat in theIllinois House of Representatives, but in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. When the General Assembly met in a\n                  joint session on February 8, 1855, to elect a U.S. senator, Lincoln and Shields received\n                  the most votes in the first round of balloting, with forty-five and forty-one votes\n                  respectively. As neither received a majority of votes, several more rounds of balloting\n                  ensued. Lincoln received a majority of the anti-Nebraska votes until the tenth and\n                  final ballot, when he withdrew and urged his supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratTrumbull in order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With\n                  the votes of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See1854 Federal Election.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

        "text": "5The period between the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 and the outbreak\n                  of the Civil War seven years later was marked by violence and political conflict in\n                  the Kansas Territory that was collectively referred to asBleeding Kansas. During this period, constitutions were drafted by both pro- and anti-slavery factions\n                  in the territory. Ultimately, a constitutional convention in 1859 drafted the largely\n                  anti-slavery Wyandotte Constitution, and following ratification by Kansas residents,\n                  it was this constitution under whichKansaswas governed upon achieving statehood in 1861.David M.

        "text": "6Stephen A. Douglas argued that by allowing the slave status of Kansas and Nebraska\n                  to be determined by popular sovereignty, the  Kansas-Nebraska Act would ultimately\n                  result in the territories gaining statehood as free states.Yates had recently been defeated by Democrat Thomas L. Harris in his bid for reelection\n                  toCongressin Illinois’ Sixth Congressional District, garnering 49.5 percent of the vote to\n                  Harris’ 50.5 percent. Yates, aWhig, had opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, while Harris spoke in favor of it. On the campaign\n                  trail, Harris touted “the glorious principle of popular sovereignty” promoted by the\n                  act, and like Douglas, argued that the measure would extend freedom in the territories.The DemocraticIllinois State Registersimilarly argued during the 1854 election season that popular sovereignty would ensure\n                  that Kansas and Nebraska entered as free states, due to factors such as the self-interest\n                  of territorial settlers and the unsuitability of conditions in the territories for\n                  large-scale slave labor.David M.
