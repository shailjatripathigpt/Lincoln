On January\n                  27, 1846, the House Committee on Military Affairs had reported a bill allowing the\n                  president, “under certain circumstances,” to accept the services of volunteers--with\n                  no mention of tensions with Mexico.  After Polk’s message, the House conflated Polk’s\n                  request for a declaration of war and the bill, amending the bill by striking out the\n                  entire first section and inserting a preamble affirming that by an act of Mexico war\n                  existed between the United States and Mexico and allowing the president to “prosecute\n                  said war to a speedy and successful termination,” by calling for volunteers, and appropriating\n                  $10 million for the conflict.  The House adopted this amendment by a vote of 123 yeas\n                  to 67 nays, and passed the bill as amended by a vote of 174 yeas to 14 nays.

You have at least twenty speeches in your possession that fully\n               explain it– I\n               will, however, try it once more– The news reached Washington of the commencement of\n               hostilities on theRio Grande, and of the great peril of Gen: Taylor's army– Every body, whig anddemocrat, was for sending\n               them aid, in men and money– It was necessary to pass a bill for this– TheLocoshad a majority in bothHouses, and they brought in a bill with a preamble, saying—Whereaswar exists by the act of Mexico, therefore we send Gen: Taylor men and money– The\n               whigs moved to strike out the preamble, so that they could vote to send the men and\n               money, without\n               saying any thing about how the war commenced; but, being in the minority they were\n               voted down, and the\n               preamble was retained– Then, on the passage of the bill, the question came upon^them,^\"shall\n               we voteforpreamble and bill both together, or against both together–\n               They could not voteagainstsending help to Gen: Taylor, and therefore\n               they votedforboth together– Is there any difficulty in understanding\n               this? Even my littlespeech, shows how this<Page 5>was; and if you will go to the Library you may\n               get the Journals of 1845-6, in which you can find the whole for yourself–9"
