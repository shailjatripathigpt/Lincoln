        "text": "2In September of 1858 Churchill Coffing responded positively to an invitation from\n                  his fellow Old LineWhigsto run as an independent candidate for theU.S. House of Representativesin the Third Congressional District ofIllinois, challenging abolitionist Republican Owen Lovejoy who was running for reelection.\n                  Churchill explained his position as opposing  the spread of slavery to the territories,\n                  but also opposing complete abolition. On September 10, 1858, the Douglas andBuchananDemocrats held conventions inBloomingtonto select candidates to run in the Third Congressional District. The factions attempted\n                  to compromise on a joint candidate, with Coffing considered as a possibility, but\n                  were unable to come to a consensus. The Douglas Democrats ultimately nominated George W. Armstrong and the Buchanan Democrats nominated David Le Roy. Absent an official party designation,\n                  and with a Republican candidate and two Democratic candidates also in the running,\n                  one newspaper classified Coffing as the anti-Lovejoy candidate. In a statement dated\n                  October 9, 1858, Churchill withdrew from the election, stating that he had entered\n                  the race in hope of uniting the conservative elements in the Third District across\n                  party lines to defeat Lovejoy, but that it had “become apparent that the antagonism\n                  of the conflicting elements cannot be overcome.” Lovejoy won reelection, garnering\n                  57.7 percent of the vote, with Armstrong earning 38.8 percent and Le Roy receiving\n                  3.4 percent. Subsequent to withdrawing from the race, Coffing reportedly stumped \n                  in La Salle County for Abraham Lincoln, who was at this time campaigning as a candidate\n                  for the U.S. Senate in thefederal election of 1858.The Ottawa Free Trader(IL), 11 September 1858, 1:8, 2:1;The Central Transcript(Clinton, IL), 17 September 1858, 2:5;The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 13 September 1858, 2:1-2; 9 October 1858, 2:2;The Belvidere Standard(IL), 21 September 1858, 3:1;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 21 October 1858, 2:5; Howard W.

        "text": "4Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Douglas to represent Illinois in the U.S. Senate. At this\n                  time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the former Whig stronghold of central Illinois, where the state\n                  legislative races were the closest. TheChicago Tribuneargued that Coffing’s candidacy in the Third Congressional District was a cynical\n                  ploy by Douglas, who manipulated hopeless candidate Coffing into running in order\n                  to “make a sufficient diversion in the Republican ranks to elect one or two Representatives\n                  to the Legislature in that district who will vote for his return to the Senate”.Despite Whitney’s concerns about the Illinois General Assembly races in La Salle and\n                  Bureau counties, Republican candidates won the three seats up for election. La Salle\n                  and Bureau counties were both in the Seventh Illinois Senate District, where Republican\n                  Burton C. Cook held over in the election of 1858. La Salle County was in the Forty-Third\n                  Illinois House District, the Republicans of which held a convention on August 26,\n                  1858 and selectedAlexander Campbellof La Salle andRichardson S. HickofLivingston Countyas their candidates. Neither man was apparently an abolitionist. Campbell had a political\n                  background as a Whig and became a supporter of Lincoln, and Hick was rumored to have\n                  previously been a member of theAmerican Party. Campbell and Hick received 4,139 and 4,089 votes respectively, defeating Democratic\n                  candidates Samuel C. Collins and William Cogswell, who earned 3,383 and 3,412 votes\n                  respectively. Two other unidentified candidates  named McBurney and Hoffman appeared\n                  in the election returns for the Forty-Third House District in this race. Their party\n                  affiliations are not indicated, and they received only 29 and 22 votes respectively.The Republicans of the Forty-Seventh Illinois House District, which was comprised\n                  of Bureau County, selected abolitionistJohn H. Bryantas the district’s candidate by mid-October 1858. Bryant won election with 2,570 votes,\n                  while his opponents,  Buchanan Democrat Thomas Tustin (Tusten) and Douglas Democrat\n                  Benjamin L. Smith received 786 and 611 votes respectively. No evidence has been found\n                  of an independent candidate running in the Forty-Seventh House District.Allen C.

During the election of 1858, Dickey denounced Lincoln for his abandonment\n                  of the Whig principles of Clay and campaigned on behalf of Douglas.Richard Thorne was not selected as a Republican candidate for the Illinois House of\n                  Representatives from La Salle County in 1858. Thorne wrote to Lincoln early in 1859 regarding rumor of an opening for  a new  canal trustee.\n                  In his letter he argued that the Whig wing of the Republican Party in La Salle County\n                  was owed such an appointment for the sake of party unity and asked Lincoln to support\n                  him for the office, emphasizing his status as an old Whig.Leonard Swett,Remembrances of T.

Ransom^adouglasite^ofPeruinformed me this morning that a large body ofRepublicans& manyDemocratsacting in concert with them were arrangeing a plan to runChurchill Coffingas an Independant Candidate forCongress:2—they are going to await the result of theLasalle&Bureaudistrict conventions and then if certain persons are nominated as Candidates forLegislature(being such as are prominently talked of and areAbolitionistssui generis) then they will get up Independant Conventions in Bureau & Lasalle & in as many other counties as they can & nominate\n               Coffing for Congress & republicans of theDickeyStamp3for the Legislature & the Democrats will support Coffing and the Republicans of the\n               Dickey Stamp andDems.to support the Independant Candidates for the Legislature—those candidates to be understood asDouglasmen:4—as I understand & have reason to beleive Dickey is doing all that he can to bring about this result:—the same gentleman informed\n               me that he was present at a conversation between Dickey &Richard Thorne(who is a Lincoln man and a prospective candidate for the Legislature from La Salle)\n               in which Dickey avowed himself to be Anti-Lincoln much to Thornes surprise and then\n               gave reasons justifying his course<Page 2>with the intention I can’t doubt of operating upon Thorne:5—Now let me say to you that there is danger inLovejoys district & that it must be attended to to which end I beg to suggest the following\n               that you getJudge Davisto go into Lasalle & see Dickey & Coffing6& that you write toCookLovejoyGlover&c.[etc.] & urge them to dropHoughand the rest of those well known ultra Abolitionists & take up men less obnoxious:7—of course the avowed Abolitionists will vote for our Candidates whoever they are:—their\n               salvation & all their worldly political prospects depend upon their hanging onto skirts\n               of the Republican party; but it is not so clear that suchrepublicansasCoffing& a host of others who hateabolitionismwill support avowed Abolitionists:—they have no discretion & they go for the spoils:—the\n               time is not yet ripe for them:—true, Lovejoy may be invincible in that district but\n               the loss of two or three members of the Legislature throughtthe greediness of those stinking abolitionists may cost you your election:—you may\n               rely upon it that matters in Lovejoys district must be managed with more shrewdness\n               & less recklessness:—the Story which Dickey &c. will undoubtedly raise (as he has already broached it to me) that if Lovejoy &c. get a balance of power of Abolitionists in the Legislature they will demand Lovejoy\n               for theSenate&c. will intimidate many republicans & cause them to vote wrong that undoubtedly feel\n               a great preference for you:8—let me implore you to give this matter your serious consideration:—there is more\n               danger in it to my notion than in every thing that Douglas can accomplish by scouring\n               the Country"
