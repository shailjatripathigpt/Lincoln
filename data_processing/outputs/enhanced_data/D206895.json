Matheny had been aWhig,  but at the dissolution of the party, he did not commit to the Republican Party.\n                  Lincoln therefore hoped he would appeal to Republicans as well as Democrats who opposed\n                  Stephen A. Douglas.  Matheny ran in opposition to incumbentThomas L. Harris, reportedly still calling himself a Whig but running as an independent candidate\n                  supported by the Republican Party. John L. McConnell also entered the race as a Buchanan\n                  Democrat. Harris won reelection, garnering 57.6 percent of the vote compared to 41.4\n                  percent earned by Matheny, and less than 1 percent received by McConnell.John M.
