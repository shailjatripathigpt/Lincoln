Webb to the Editors of The Old Soldier, 2 March 1840 Still keeping in mind the scenes and events of 1812 and '13, it is with pleasure I bear testimony to the humanity and bravery of our General—Wm. H. Harrison,—being as well acquainted with him and his conduct, as any private soldier in his\n\narmy. At the first address he made to his officers and soldiers at St. Mary’s Block\n\nHouse, on theSt. Mary’s river, four regiments were formed in solid column around theHero of Tippecanoe. I never can forget that on that occasion, he told his soldiers if there was any\n\nof them who could not stand the privations of a soldier’s life—hard fighting, cold,\n\nhunger and nakedness— if he would make it known by hoisting his musket, he would give\n\nhim an honorable discharge. But to the honor of‘Old Kentuck’ only one man shouldered his musket. This was an evidence of his humanity, in giving\n\nto such as were unable to perform a soldier’s duty, the privilege of returning to\n\ntheir homes. In that address to his soldiers, he said, that he would be with them\n\nin all their dangers—that he wanted to meet the enemy on equal terms, and to beat\n\nthem, and save the lives of his brave soldiers. He also said it did not show good\n\ngeneralship in a general, although he beat his enemy, to get his army cut up. At\n\nthe close of that speech the boys from ‘Old Kentuck,’ made the frontiers ofOhioring with their shouts. For the present, I shall close my notice of this part of\n\nthe campaign. But to you my companions, who bore arms, and were in the several memorable\n\nbattles, where cannon roared, where shells flew, where muskets and rifles carried\n\ndeath before them—in which our brave General was always victorious—I would say, as\n\nwe once flocked around him in victory, in “days that tried men’s souls,” we will gather\n\nround him again, spread our banners to the breeze, and contend for another glorious\n\nvictory! There is no danger of being defeated. Our gallant commander never lost a\n\nbattle! Lift up your heads, my old worn out brother Soldiers! Your general is in the field—again\n\nrally around him. Do your duty, and your general at your head, on the 4th of March\n\nnext, will mount the bastions, at the City ofWashington, with the watch-word, “the White House is ours!” Defend the cause of your country, and its liberties. Rememberfought and bled for the freedom we now enjoy, and let our determination be never\n\nto surrender our rights to men who will not administer the government right, and who\n\ncare for nothing but office. You hear the abuse lavished on our beloved commander\n\nby his enemies. You know that their statements against him are false. Contradict\n\nthem. Testify to the truth. Be brave as on the field of the battle.—You once did\n\nyour duty and prospered, and you will prosper again. Load and prime—Be always ready.1",
