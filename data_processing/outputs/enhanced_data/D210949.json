In the summer and fall of that year,\n                  the two candidates engaged in aseries of political debatesthroughout the state. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.  At the time of this letter, Lincoln and Douglas had debated atOttawa(August 21),Freeport(August 27),Jonesboro(September 15), andCharleston(September 18).John W. Crockett delivered a political speech at theLogan Countycourthouse in Lincoln on September 28, 1858. Reports of the specific contents of\n                  Crockett’s speech vary inRepublicanandDemocraticnewspapers. In a letter to editors of theLouisville Courier, however, Crockett asserted that he made no direct reference to Lincoln’s or Douglas’s\n                  senatorial campaigns during his speech. He stated that his remarks pertained to his\n                  views on theMissouri Compromiseof 1820, theCompromise of 1850, theKansas-Nebraska Actof 1854, the Fugitive Slave Act, theDred Scott decision, and the role of the Democratic Party in  creating “sectional strife.” Crockett also\n                  indicated his support for forming “a party of conservative men” from both North and\n                  South to defeat the Democrats in the1860 Federal Election.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-85;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 21 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-21; 27 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-27; 15 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-15; 18 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-18;Daily Missouri Republican(Saint Louis), 2 October 1858, 2:3;Weekly Belleville Advocate(IL), 20 October 1858, 1:7;Louisville Daily Courier(KY), 30 October 1858, 1:6."

At the time, members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore,\n                  the races in Logan and other counties  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewould determine the outcome of the race for U.S. Senate.Samuel C. Parks had represented Logan County in the Illinois House of Representatives\n                  in 1855.  Parks had supported Lincoln on nine of the ten ballots during theelection for U.S. senatorin 1855.  By 1858, however, Parks had left the Illinois House.In the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the General Assembly, allowing Douglas\n                  to win reelection.  In Logan County, DemocratSamuel W. Fuller, elected in 1856 to the Illinois Senate, held over in 1858.  In the race for the\n                  seat representing the Thirty-Fifth House District, Democrat George H. Campbell  won over Republican William Walker. Fuller and Campbell both voted for Douglas for U.S. senator.Allen C.
