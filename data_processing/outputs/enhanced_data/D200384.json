Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective\n                  Whig congressmen. Hardin and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed that the\n                  1846 nomination should have been his. In September 1845, Lincoln inquired of Hardin’s\n                  plans, but Hardin would not answer definitively one way or the other.  While Hardin\n                  delayed officially announcing his candidacy, Lincoln set out to solidify his own support.Lincoln and Hardin were vying to represent the Seventh Congressional District, which\n                  included the counties ofCass,Logan,Marshall,Mason, Menard,Morgan,Putnam,Sangamon,Scott,Tazewell, andWoodford.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:218, 231;Abraham Lincoln to Henry E.
