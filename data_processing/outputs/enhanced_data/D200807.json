        "text": "2This letter is related to a lawsuit involving Adams,John H. Kemper, andJohn Bovey.  Kemper recovered a judgment against William F. Bradshaw, and the U.S. marshal sold\n                  Bradshaw's land inOgle County, Illinois, to satisfy the judgment.  Bradshaw conveyed the land to Adams and Bovey.  Adams\n                  and Bovey had possession of the land that Kemper claimed to own by virtue of the judgment.\n                  Kemper sued Adams and Bovey in an action of ejectment in theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinois, to remove them from the property.  Adams and Bovey retained Abraham Lincoln, Thomas\n                  J. Turner, andSolon Cumins; Kemper retainedStephen T. Logan. Lincoln and his fellow attorneys for the defense argued that the time during which\n                  Kemper could sue had expired.  The Circuit Court found for Kemper.  By virtue of anactpromulgated in March 1839, the  losing party in an ejectment case was entitled to\n                  one new trial simply by paying the court costs. Adams and Bovey  paid the costs and\n                  motioned for a new trial, which the court granted. A key aspect of the defense’s case\n                  in the new trial revolved around whether Adams was present at the time the deed in\n                  question was executed.Lincoln responded to Adams on the verso of this letter, which is shown in the second\n                  image. Lincoln’s letter to Judge Onslow Peters, if he penned one, has not been located.Kemper v. Adams & Bovey, Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition,  2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),http://www.lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Details.aspx?case=140935."

        "text": "3No letter from Lincoln to Turner written in early November 1854 has been located.\n                  However, between 1850 and 1858, Lincoln wrote Turner nine letters relating to this\n                  case.  He also corresponded about the case multiple times with Adams, Bovey, and Cumins.Ultimately, in the new trial, the jury again ruled for Kemper.  Adams and Bovey apparently\n                  sued Kemper for an injunction to stop the execution of the judgment, and in March\n                  1858, theU.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois, ruled for Adams and Bovey.  Lincoln received $100 for his legal services.For the letters related to this case, seeKemper v. Adams & Bovey, Martha L.
