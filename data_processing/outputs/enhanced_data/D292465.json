In a letter-writing campaign to some in Illinois that he believed supported Fillmore,\n                  Lincoln argued that Fillmore stood no chance of success in Illinois and that therefore\n                  Fillmore supporters should cast their ballots for Republican candidateJohn C.

Buchanan\n                  won the presidency. In Illinois, Buchanan won 44.1 percent of the total vote to Fillmore’s\n                  15.7 percent and Fremont’s 40.2 percent. The race was most difficult for Republicans\n                  in Southern Illinois, as so few Republicans lived in that region of the state. Gallatin\n                  County’s voters awarded Buchanan a strong majority: 63.1 percent of the vote to 34.9\n                  percent for Fillmore and a meagre 2 percent for Fremont. The Republican Party swept\n                  the races for every state office in Illinois, however.
