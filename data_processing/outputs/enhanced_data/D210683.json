Davidsonfrom his appointment as U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of Illinois and replaced\n                  him with Iram Nye. In May 1858, he removed John Connelly, Sr. as register of theUnited States Land Officein Springfield and replaced him with William E. Keefer.Lincolnrepliedto this letter on May 10.
