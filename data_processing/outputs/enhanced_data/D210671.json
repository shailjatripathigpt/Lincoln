        "text": "2Strong and Abraham Lincoln were two of the attorneys for the defendants in the case\n                  ofCochran & Hall v. Camp et al., which commenced in theU.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinoisin October 1855.  The case concerned a dispute over ownership of lands near theOhio & Mississippi Railroad. The firms ofH. C. Seymour & Companyand Sanger, Camp & Company had joined together in 1852 to purchase over $6,000 worth\n                  of U.S. government land warrants for 1,080 acres along the railroad for the purpose\n                  of speculation. Initially, the two firms, along with other individuals, had proposed\n                  making the purchases as a land association, but the agreement was apparently verbal\n                  and the contemplate land association fell apart when the parties attempted to codify\n                  the terms. Irvin Camp, a partner in Sanger, Camp & Co., held the title to the warrants\n                  in order to locate the land and purchased the property in his own name.George W. CochranandJames C. Hall, two of the individuals who had discussed forming the land association, later acquired\n                  H. C. Seymour & Co.’s interest in the property and claimed that they had not received\n                  their due percentage of the land. The pair sued Camp to convey the 1,080 acres. Camp\n                  retained Lincoln andWilliam H. Herndon, who were unable to effect a compromise but continued to represent him in the case\n                  until Lincoln’selectionas president in 1860. The case was settled in 1863 and the court ultimately found\n                  for the plaintiffs and ordered Camp to convey his interest to Cochran, who had purchased\n                  Hall’s interest.The plaintiffs’ attorneysJohn T. StuartandBenjamin S. Edwardsfiled the amended bill mentioned here on June 15, 1857. The answer to this amended\n                  bill that was prepared by Strong was filed February 6, 1858.Cochran & Hall v. Camp et al., Martha L.
