He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S.\n                  Senate seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. He\n                  likely wrote Davis such a letter, although no correspondence between Lincoln and Davis\n                  in the whole of 1854 prior to December has been located.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois State Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.In mid-December 1854, Leonard Swett made at least two trips to northern Illinois to\n                  ascertain whether specific individuals would support Lincoln as a candidate for U.S.\n                  senatorDavid Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

Fisher, considered Wait Talcott\n                  a “red hotabolitionist” who would likely prefer aFree Soilcandidate for the U.S. Senate seat, but that her husband would write Lincoln directly\n                  after seeing Talcott in person. Lucius Fisher’s letter to Lincoln, if he wrote one,\n                  has not been located.Thomas B. Talcott, Wait Talcott’s brother,wroteLincoln on December 14, 1854, in reply to a letter Lincoln wrote him  December 6.\n                  In this reply, Thomas Talcott stated that his brother was “an abolitionist of the\n                  Lovejoy stamp” and that the prospects of him voting for Lincoln were “not flattering.”\n                  Lincoln’s December 6, 1854 letter to Thomas Talcott has not been located.The portion of Rachel Fisher’s letter that Davis transcribed for Lincoln does not\n                  include any mention of Luther W. Lawrence. No correspondence between Lawrence and\n                  Lincoln has been located. However, in a January 6, 1855lettertoElihu B. Washburne, Lincoln wrote that he believed Lawrence “will be for me. . . but he has not spoken\n                  it out.”"

Loganmotioned for the adjournment of the joint session, but members refused to adjourn\n                  by a vote of 56 to 42. Of the forty-one legislators who voted for Lincoln on the third\n                  ballot, only one—George F. Foster—voted against adjourning the session.Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the General Assembly\n                  selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Talcott voted for Lincoln for the first six ballots, then shifted toWilliam B. Ogden, before moving to Trumbull in the ninth ballot. Lawrence cast his first three ballots\n                  for Lincoln, voted forMartin P. Sweeton the fourth ballot, switched to Ogden for the next four ballots, then settled on\n                  Trumbull for ballots nine and ten. Both Swan and Pinckney voted for Lincoln through\n                  the first nine rounds of voting, before switching their votes to Trumbull. Adams cast\n                  seven ballots for Lincoln before switching his vote to Trumbull. Matthias L. Dunlap\n                  voted for Lincoln in the first three rounds, switched to Trumbull in the fourth, back\n                  to Lincoln in the fifth, and finally settled on Trumbull on the eighth ballot. See\n                  the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:401-2; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
