Edwards, who practiced law extensively throughout central  Illinois, serving as attorney\n                  in over 400 cases that also involved Lincoln. While Lincoln’s eventual brother-in-lawNinian W. Edwardswas also a lawyer, he spent much of his career in the legislature, in appointed government\n                  positions, and as a bank director rather than practicing law.Martha L.
