In this case, the content\n                  of Gilbert’s speech has not been located.Lincoln was inMonmouthleading up to the state and federal elections of 1858.   Lincoln was running againstStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent,  in the1858 Federal Electionas the IllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. He traveled heavily during the summer and fall of 1858, crisscrossingIllinoisdelivering speeches and campaigning on behalf ofRepublicancandidates for federal and state office.   In addition to his individual engagements,\n                  LincolndebatedDouglas at seven locations around the state.  At the time, theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; thus the outcome of the races\n                  for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewas highly relevant to the Lincoln’s candidacy.

        "text": "4On June 23, 1856,Robert A. Toombsannounced his intention of introducing a  bill that would supposedly quell the escalatingpolitical violence in Kansas. The so-called Toombs Bill sought to resolve issues in theKansas Territoryby formulating a process for bringing the territory into the union as a new state.\n                  The bill proposed taking a census of the Kansas Territory’s inhabitants, empowering\n                  PresidentFranklin Pierceto appoint five commissioners to ensure that voting integrity existed in the territory,\n                  and authorizing white men over twenty-one years of age residing in the territory to\n                  elect a convention to form a state government.On July 2, the U.S. Senate brought the bill up to a vote and a debate on the bill\n                  ensued, during which Trumbull and others proposed multiple amendments. Douglas participated\n                  in this debate. Trumbull argued that because Toombs’s bill stipulated that the Kansas\n                  Territory’s voters be, in effect, re-registered under federal supervision, that the\n                  bill was asserting the right of theU.S. Congressto regulate and govern the territories and would therefore nullify laws which theKansas Territorial Legislaturehad passed related to the management of its own elections. TheKansas-Nebraska Actdid not specify that the U.S. Congress reserved the right to assert its authority\n                  over the territories’ elections. Although the Senate voted to amend the Toombs bill\n                  so that the Kansas Territory’s elections were merely postponed rather than forbidden\n                  until the “complete execution” of the act, Trumbull argued that the bill exposed Douglas\n                  and the Democrats’s hypocrisy on the concept of popular sovereignty. Trumbull proposed\n                  an amendment with language explicitly declaring “all the acts and proceedings” of\n                  the Kansas Territorial Legislature “null and void” as well as an amendment making\n                  it clear that the Kansas Territorial Legislature held the right “at any time to exclude\n                  slavery . . . or to recognize and regulate it therein.” The Senate rejected both of\n                  these amendments.Toombs’s bill passed the Senate, which had a Democratic majority, on  July 2, but\n                  ultimately failed in theU.S. House of Representatives, in which Republicans held a majority.S. 356. 34th Cong. 1st sess.

        "text": "5This quote is attributed to Lincoln but no text in Lincoln’s has been discovered.The Whig Party effectively came to an end in the first half of the 1850s as opposition\n                  to the Kansas-Nebraska Act  fractured the Whig voter base into several new parties.\n                  The remaining political parties attempted to draw support from the former Whig voters\n                  in an attempt to absorb their numbers and secure political influence. Both Republican\n                  and Democratic candidates made attempts to portray themselves as the successors to\n                  the Whig party. Both Lincoln and Douglas compared themselves to  Henry Clay, who was\n                  incredibly popular among the former Whig voter base. Douglas and Clay both worked\n                  on theCompromise of 1850, which temporarily lowered rising tensions over the expansion of slavery into states\n                  that were being admitted into the Union.  Clay died in 1852. Douglas portrayed himself\n                  as the successor to Clay in the 1858 campaign, a portrayal that Lincoln refuted in\n                  his own speeches.In the state’s local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the General Assembly\n                  and Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however,\n                  and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Allen C.
