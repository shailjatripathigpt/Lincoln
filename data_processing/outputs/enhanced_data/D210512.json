Abraham Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored\n                  over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. In early June 1849, Lincoln sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting\n                  letters in support of his candidacy for commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office.\n                  Although no such letter from Lincoln to Henry has been located, it is likely Lincoln\n                  made a similar request of him since Henry states that he has gathered the signatures\n                  of Whigs on a letter to send to President Zachary Taylor.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B.

        "text": "3William Butler was one of two supporters of Butterfield who circulated a petition\n                  for his appointment to the position.  Butler’s opposition to Lincoln may well have\n                  stemmed from Butler’s disappointment over not receiving a federal appointment.  In\n                  February 1849,William F. ElkinwroteLincoln that Butler was an applicant for the office of receiver at the U.S. General\n                  Land Office in Springfield, urging Lincoln to act on his behalf.  Lincoln, however,\n                  had already committed toWalter DavisandTurner R. Kingfor receiver and register, respectively.   Lincoln insteadwroteSecretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing recommending Butler for pension agent in the\n                  Springfield office of theU.S. Bureau of Pensions.   Lincoln, however,  alsorecommendedWilliam S. WallaceandOrville Paddockfor the position of pension agent.  Davis and Wallace received the offices of receiver\n                  and pension agent, respectively, leaving Butler disappointed and angry with Lincoln.\n                  Butler would spend the next decade opposing Lincoln’s political aspirations.  The\n                  two would not speak for several years.Henry wrote Lincoln several other letters related to the U.S. General Land Office.\n                  Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job\n                  went to Butterfield instead.
