Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for the Illinois House of Representatives andIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  See the1858 Federal Election.Peter K. Hull was found to be  ineligible to run for the Illinois House of Representatives\n                  as he had not lived in the state of Illinois for three consecutive years, as required\n                  by article three, section three of the1848 Illinois Constitution.The Central Transcript(Clinton, IL), 2 July 1858, 2:1; John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac, 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 220;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 28 July 1858, 2:4;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 30 July 1858, 2:2; Allen C.

While Stickel defeated  Coler by a 339-vote majority in DeWitt\n                  County and a 375-vote majority in Champaign County,  Stickel came out ahead by only\n                  forty-three votes in Piatt County, and Coler won Macon County by 179 votes.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac, 1673-1968, 222;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 November 1858, 2:1-2;The Central Transcript(Clinton, IL), 28 October 1858, 2:3;Weekly Central Transcript(Clinton, IL), 12 November 1858, 1:2, 2:4-5;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 11 November 1858, 2:7."

        "text": "4Republican Richard J. Oglesby was running for theU.S. House of Representativesin Illinois’ Seventh Congressional District. His candidacy was discussed as early\n                  as May of 1858 alongside that of fellow RepublicanHenry P. H. Bromwell, with Oglesby promoted in the press as a candidate at the beginning of July 1858.\n                  The Republicans of the Seventh Congressional District of Illinois apparently never\n                  held a formal convention to select a candidate for the race and around this time Bromwell\n                  declined to run against Oglesby. Oglesby ultimately received 46.3 percent of the vote\n                  and lost to DemocratJames C. Robinson, who garnered 53.5 percent.One newspaper account of this speech made by Oglesby at the Monticello district convention\n                  praised it as “very eloquent and argumentative” and stated that in it Oglesby “showed\n                  up the objects and aims of the slave driving and slavery extension Democracy”. A letter\n                  published in theChicago Tribunedescribing the speech reported that Oglesby used the speeches ofHenry Clayto demonstrate that the Republican Party’s views aligned with those of Clay and that\n                  Oglesby denounced theDred Scott decisionin his oration.George W.
