        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote the text of the bill and the bill title on page two.Peter Greenof the Committee on Banks and Other Corporations, to which theHouse of Representativeshad referred a memorial from the State Bank of Illinois, introducedHB 286in the House   on February 22, 1841.  The House tabled the minority report of the\n                  Committee, which condemned the bill as legalizing the suspension of specie payments,\n                  and refused to print 2500 copies of the memorial by a vote of 25 yeas to 51 nays,\n                  withAbraham Lincolnvoting nay.  The House also refused to print 500 copies by a vote of 27 yeas to 48\n                  nays, Lincoln voting nay.  The House refused to engross the bill by a vote of 38 yeas\n                  to 38 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House later rescinded this vote. On February\n                  24, a representative offered anamendment, authored and written by Lincoln, striking out the third section and inserting a\n                  new section, which the House adopted. The House also adopted an amendment adding two\n                  additional sections.  On Lincoln’s motion, the House rejected an additionalamendmentby a vote of 45 yeas to 32 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  On February 25, a representative\n                  offered an amendment to add an additional section,  which representatives sought to\n                  amend with an amendment.  Lincoln moved the previous question, which the House rejected\n                  by a vote of 34 yeas to 47 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The House tabled the bill\n                  and proposed amendments, agreeing to rescind the rule requiring two-thirds vote to\n                  amend a bill upon its passage by a vote of 58 yeas to 20 nays, with Lincoln voting\n                  yea.  The House subsequently took up the bill and proposed amendments, tabling the\n                  amendment to the amendment, but refusing to table the amendment by a vote of 32 yeas\n                  to 50 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House adopted the amendment by a vote of\n                  41 yeas to 35 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The House rejected the bill as amended\n                  by a vote of 14 yeas to 63 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House later agreed\n                  to re-consider this vote by a vote of 44 yeas to 30 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.\n                  The House referred the bill to a select committee of five by a vote of 49 yeas to\n                  26 nays, with Lincoln not voting.  The select committee reported back the bill with\n                  amendments, in which the House concurred by a vote of 45 yeas to 34 nays, with Lincoln\n                  voting yea.  The House passed the bill as amended by a vote of 43 yeas to 38 nays,\n                  with Lincoln voting nay.  On February 25, theSenatereferred the bill to the Committee of the Whole.  The Committee of the Whole reported\n                  back the bill with amendments, in which the Senate concurred by a vote of 25 yeas\n                  to 14 nays.    The Senate further amended the bill by adding a proviso to the sixth\n                  section by a vote of 33 yeas to 5 nays.  It also added a seventh section by a vote\n                  of 31 yeas to 6 nays.  The Senate passed the bill as amended by a vote of 21 yeas\n                  to 18 nays. On February 27, the House concurred with the Senate amendments by a vote\n                  of 43 yeas to 35 nays, with Lincoln not voting.  On February 27, theCouncil of Revisionapproved the bill and theactbecame law.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G.

        "text": "2The General Assembly amended this section by adding the following proviso: “Provided, That when said bank shall resume specie payments for its evidences of indebtedness,\n                  if at any time after such resumption, thebankshall again suspend such payment for a longer period of time than is now allowed\n                  by its charter, then and in such case theGeneral Assemblyshall have the power to declare said charter forfeited.”Section twenty-five of the bank’sincorporation actstipulated that if the bank refused or neglected to redeem, for ten days after demand,\n                  its notes or evidence of debt in specie, the bank would discontinue operations and\n                  its charter would be forfeited.  Anact supplementaryto the incorporation act gave the bank an additional fifty days to suspend specie\n                  payments. Under provisions of the incorporation act and an act supplementary thereto,\n                  if the bank did not resume specie payments within sixty days after suspension, it\n                  would lose its charter. In May 1837, the bank suspended specie payments in response\n                  to thePanic of 1837.  In July, a special session of the legislature commenced to deal with the banking\n                  crisis.  On July 21, the General Assembly passed anactsuspending until the end of the next general or special session of the legislature\n                  provisions of the law requiring the bank to forfeit its charter for refusing to redeem\n                  its notes in specie for sixty days.  In December 1839, the state’s debt crisis forced\n                  the bank to again suspend specie payments.  GovernorThomas Carlincalled the legislature into special session to deal with the crisis.  In hismessageto the General Assembly,  Carlin attacked the bank and demanded an investigation\n                  of its affairs.  The legislators complied by establishing a joint select committee.\n                  Despite Carlin’s hostility, the legislature  passed anacton January 31, 1840, resuscitating the bank with, as Lincoln described in alettertoJohn T. Stuart, “some trifling modifications.”  The act revived the bank’s charter and suspending\n                  stipulations on specie payments until the end of the next legislative session.Illinois HouseJournal. 1839. 11th G.
