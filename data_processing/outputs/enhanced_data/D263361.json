General Land Officein Springfield, Illinois, to purchase 320 acres on which he claimed to have settled.\n                  However, legally, Wright had no claim to the land, and in October 1855, U.S. District\n                  AttorneyWilliam J. Allenindicted Wright  for perjury in theUnited States District Court, Southern District of Illinois.  Wright hired Lincoln,Stephen T. Logan, and Thomas L. Harris to represent him and plead not guilty. The jury failed to reach\n                  a verdict at the trial during the March 1856 term of the court. Wright’s lawyers withdrew\n                  his plea and motioned the court to quash the indictment, and the court agreed.In June 1856, Allen indicted Wright again for perjury.  The jury again failed to reach\n                  a verdict at the trial during the January 1857 term of the court.  In February 1857,\n                  both parties agreed to remand the case to the United States Circuit Court. At a meeting\n                  of the Circuit Court on June 25, 1857, JudgeSamuel H. Treat, ordered “Nolle Prosequi,” whereby Allen declared that he would not prosecute further\n                  the case against Wright.United States v. Wright, Martha L.
