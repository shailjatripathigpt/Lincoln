Moore, Weldon,\n                  andBarzilla CampbellwroteLincoln at least one more letter related to the election of 1858 after this letter.Lincoln delivered a speech in Clinton on September 2.The pro-Douglas Democrats of the Thirty-Sixth District of theIllinois House of Representatives, which includedChampaign, DeWitt,Macon, andPiattcounties, nominated pro-Douglas Democrat William N. Coler in 1858. The pro-Buchanan\n                  Democrats of the district nominated pro-Buchanan Democrat Philip B. Shepherd, but\n                  Shepherd dropped out of the race before election day and was subsequently replaced\n                  by pro-Buchanan Democrat candidateWilliam Prather. Coler and Prather ultimately lost to Republican candidateDaniel Stickelby several hundred votes.During the DeWitt County Republican Convention in Clinton on August 21, delegates\n                  nominated former American Party member Decatur Pool as their candidate for sheriff. On September 4, delegates to the pro-Buchanan DeWitt\n                  County Democratic Convention, which was also held in Clinton, nominatedWilson Allenfor sheriff. In the end, voters elected Pool sheriff. He served until 1860.Sidney Breese did not join the race for the U.S. Senate in 1858—the contest only pitted\n                  Douglas against Lincoln.In the end, in the local elections of 1858, although Republicans won a majority of\n                  all votes cast in Illinois, pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Stickel cast his ballot for Lincoln.\n                  Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Henry C.

As to theBuchananMeeting, Saturday It was a fine affair.4Col[Colonel]Carpentercame down like a good quiet Citizen the night before, stayed at the hotel5& was introduced to every body, & on Saturday morning (hot as you remember it was) about 11,   with musick banners  Carriages & an old soldier marked 76[1776] (really1812)he was escorted to the fair^ground^the procession & everything of that kind went off better than atDouglass's (i e) more show & form, but the crowd was at least2/3as large asD's.6Carpenter took the stand spoke between 1 & 2 hours then they adjourned to eat the\n               ox this being doneCcame back & finished his Speech.  His comment was  as usual that he wasdemocratadhered to the democratic party that the democratic party was opposed to the republican\n               party, that he was not there to discuss Slavery as a moral or social question, but\n               simply as a<Page 2>political right under the Constitution, addressing the usual arguments, that property\n               in Slaves was recognized by the  constitution, and that it was an unfair copartnership\n               if the south could not take his property into the territories as well as the north.\n               then he paid his respects to you said he was not much acquainted with you, but was\n               willing to say you was a gentleman, because D who speaks well of but few had said\n               that much.  That he would as soon you would represent the republicans^as anyone^, but he did object to the sectional move you was making.  In regard to the \"Dred Scott\" he acknowledged \"that in his opinion as a political question that decision bound\n               no one and if he was a Senator or Representative he would not consider himself bound\n               by it, that he would have a perfect^right^to try & Change it in any Cons^ti^tutional way.  Then he pitched into Douglass.  Showed his whole course since 54[1854],7thinksBissells election by 8,000 made D changehiscourse.8He  met Douglass argument about \"Bolters\" in this way9A man is a democrat because he believes in the principles of the democratic party,\n               that if a majority of theStateCentral Committee for the Democrats had been turned, Repubs[Republicans] Called a Convention adopted a platform in opposition to the National democracy would\n               any democrat be bound by it, that theVanburenfree soilersinNYin1848done that same thing & who ever called theV Bmovement in NY[New York] a democratic movement, &c  &c[etc etc]10"
