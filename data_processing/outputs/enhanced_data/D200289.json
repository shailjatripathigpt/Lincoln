Loganearlier in the spring, formally became Logan’s junior partner. In 1839, Daniel Stafford,\n                  Jr. had retained Stuart & Lincoln to represent him in a case in theSangamon County Circuit Court; in March 1841 Logan & Lincoln took over the case. The money due to Stout, Ingoldsby\n                  & Co. may have been related to two legal cases in 1837, wherein the company sued two\n                  centralIllinoiscorporations to recover debts.“The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: A Narrative Overview,” Martha L.
