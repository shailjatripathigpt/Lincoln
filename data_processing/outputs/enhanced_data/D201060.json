        "text": "2Abraham Lincolnwroteto Gustave P.  Koerner on July 15 asking him to ascertain if GermanRepublicanFriedrich K. F. Heckerwould visit the Springfield region and address local German-Americans. Koernerrespondedtwo days later, writing to Lincoln that a visit from Hecker would be unlikely to\n                  do much good because he could not win over political opponents, some of whom considered\n                  him to be the Anti-Christ.  Lincoln was the Republican Party candidate forU.S. Senatein 1858. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.The moralizing tone of the Republican platform to stop the spread of slavery led many\n                  German-Americans to push for the party to defend immigrants. However, the Republican\n                  Party needed both the German votes and the votes of formerAmerican Partymembers to win in1858. These two groups possessed decidedly opposing viewpoints, with the nativism of the\n                  American Party directing its anger at immigrants such as the Germans. Lincoln was\n                  not a supporter of nativism and in alettertoJoshua F. Speedin 1855 he wrote, \"How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor\n                  of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to\n                  be pretty refined.\"Hecker addressed a crowd of German Republicans inBloomingtonin late October, and he was described by one newspaper as \"the political idol of\n                  the German population of thisstate.\" Hecker also spoke inChicagoon October 23 and inGalenaon October 28.Alison Clark Efford, \"Abraham Lincoln, German-Born Republicans, and\n                     American Citizenship,\"Marquette Law Review93  (Summer 2010): 1376-78; Sabine Freitag,Friedrich Hecker: Two Lives for Liberty, trans. by Steven Rowan (St. Louis: St. Louis Mercantile Library, University of Missouri–St.\n                     Louis, 2006), 199; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:432, 458;The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 30 October 1858, 3:1;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 26 October 1858, 1:4; 30 October 1858, 1:3."

Madison County was located in the Eighth Illinois Congressional\n                  District. In the 1858 congressional election, Democratic candidatePhillip B. Foukedefeated Republican candidateJehu Bakerwith 57.2 percent of the vote to 41.8 percent of the vote, with Madison County giving\n                  Fouke 51.2 percent of the vote to 48.1 percent for Baker.    In elections for the\n                  Illinois General Assembly, DemocratSamuel A. Buckmasterfrom Madison County beat Gillespie by 184 votes in the Senate race. The men elected\n                  to the House in Madison County—Zephaniah B. Job(over Republican Isaac Cox) andJoseph H. Sloss(over RepublicanCurtis Blakeman) — both voted for Stephen A. Douglas for U.S. Senate in the1858 Federal Election, as did Buckmaster.  Lincoln would lose the Senate race to Douglas.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.
