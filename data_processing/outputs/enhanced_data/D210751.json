Douglasin theU.S. Senate. During his nomination at the1858 Illinois Republican Convention, Lincoln delivered an address—widely known as his “House Divided” speech—in which\n                  he charged that Douglas was part of a plot or conspiracy to nationalize slavery. Lincoln\n                  argued that the plot began with Douglas’Kansas-Nebraska bill, which PresidentFranklin Piercesupported, then was advanced by both theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in theDred Scott case—handed down by Chief JusticeRoger B. Taney—and by PresidentJames Buchanan’s call to support the court’s decision. Lincoln warned his audience that, if Douglas\n                  were not defeated and the slave power not overthrown, another Supreme Court ruling\n                  could build upon the Dred Scott decision and proclaim that the U.S. Constitution prohibited\n                  states from excluding slavery within their own borders.Joseph Medill to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Joseph Medill;Ray, Medill & Company to Abraham Lincoln;Joseph Medill to Abraham Lincoln; Joseph Medill to Abraham Lincoln; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458-61; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 206-9."

Each article contains an attack upon Douglas and/or his “co laborers” [sic], including an assertion that Douglas was, “one whose whole course in Congress has\n                  been in favor of a breach of national faith.”The paper had also endorsed Lincoln’s arguments regarding a conspiracy to nationalize\n                  slavery in its June 19 issue, as part of the paper’s initial coverage of Lincoln’s\n                  House Divided address.Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 19 June 1858, 2:1; 26 June 1858, 2:3;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 3 July 1858, 2:2."

        "text": "4This is another reference to Lincoln meeting Douglas on the campaign trail. For the\n                  first part of the election campaign of 1858, Lincoln often followed Douglas on the\n                  trail, delivering speeches either later in the evening after Douglas finished, or\n                  the next day. It was not until late-July that Lincoln challenged Douglas to a series\n                  of formal debates. Douglas eventually agreed, and these became the famousLincoln-Douglas Debates.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:483-85;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A. Douglas;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.

He and Scripps\n                  previously exchanged at least three other letters related to the 1858 Federal Election.Lincoln repeated his charges of Douglas being part of a plot to nationalize slavery\n                  throughout the 1858 campaign—both in speeches and during the Lincoln-Douglas Debates.In the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-DouglasDemocratsretained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.John L.
