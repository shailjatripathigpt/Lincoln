Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf ofRepublicancandidates for the General Assembly. He and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts\n                  on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Lincoln spoke in Augusta for two hours on August 25, to a crowd that was estimated\n                  to consist of 1,200 people, roughly two thirds of whom were reportedly formerHenry ClayWhigs.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 28 August 1858, 1:2; Howard W.

        "text": "3“Unterrified” was a derisive term applied to theDemocratic Partyin the middle decades of the nineteenth century. The two branches of the Democratic\n                  Party referred to by Jonas were the supporters of PresidentJames Buchananand the backers of Stephen A. Douglas. A rift had formed in the party after Douglas\n                  criticized theLecompton Constitutionand Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857. SeeBleeding Kansas. Illinois Republicans saw the rift as potentially benefitting their party, and some\n                  worked behind the scenes to exacerbate the split.Richard H.

Newspaper editorAustin Brooksof theQuincy Herald, a Douglas Democrat, used the phrase in late 1857 and with increased frequency during\n                  theelection of 1858to refer negatively to Democrats who supported Buchanan. In 1858, newspapers in other\n                  cities and states  discussed the appellation and attributed the popularization of\n                  the term to theQuincy Herald. After 1858 theQuincy Heraldcontinued to use the phrase, apparently to mean Democrats who opposed Douglas or\n                  who were considered to be disloyal to the party.The Ohio Democrat(New Philadelphia), 4 November 1842, 3:3;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 12 November 1857, 3:1;The Daily Quincy Herald(IL), 15 June 1858, 2:2; 27 October 1858, 3:3;Louisville Daily Courier(KY), 25 June 1858, 2:1;Glasgow Weekly Times(MO), 8 July 1858, 3:5;The Caledonian(St. Johnsbury, VT), 10 July 1858, 2:7;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 23 July 1858, 3:1;The Daily Gate City(Keokuk, IA), 3 August 1858, 2:1;The Quincy Herald(IL), 6 June 1860, 2:3; 23 July 1860, 2:1; Franklin William Scott,Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, vol. 6 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1910), 291."
