He even allowed himself to become\n                  a candidate for the Illinois General Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first). As the\n                  election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible\n                  nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats. In November and December 1854, he\n                  wrote confidential letters to political allies, seeking support for his candidacy\n                  and information about his prospects. He won a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives,\n                  but in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. When the General Assembly met in a\n                  joint session on February 8, 1855, to elect a U.S. senator, ten rounds of voting were\n                  needed to finally determine a victor. Lincoln received a majority of the anti-Nebraska\n                  votes until the tenth and final ballot, when he withdrew and urged his supporters\n                  to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With the votes\n                  of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See1854 Federal Election.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.
