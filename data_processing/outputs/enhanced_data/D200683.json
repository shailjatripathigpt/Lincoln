        "text": "2Lincoln references Martin’s legal work in theMadison County Circuit Courtfor theAlton & Sangamon Railroad Company, which had retained Martin andLincoln & Herndonto collect balances due on shares of capital stock purchased by stockholders.TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in February 1847 to construct and operate a railroad between\n                  Alton, Illinois, viaNew Berlin, and Springfield, Illinois.  Section two  of the company’s charter allowed the incorporators\n                  to issue $500,000 in stock at $100 per share, and section six required subscribers\n                  to purchase stock by paying $5 on each share subscribed at the time of subscribing\n                  and the balance in installments called for by a board of directors. The incorporators\n                  opened subscription for stock in May 1847.  Many stock subscribers owned property\n                  near the proposed route. On January 29, 1851, however, the General Assembly altered\n                  the charter to allow the company to construct the road on a more direct route, bypassing\n                  the property of several stockholders.  Believing that the change in route voided their\n                  subscription agreements, many  investors refused to pay their remaining installments,\n                  and the company  hired Lincoln & Herndon to collect the full subscriptions.  Several\n                  of the delinquent subscribers were fromSangamon County, Illinois, and thirty-seven were fromMadison County, Illinois.  The railroad hired Martin to collect the full subscriptions in Madison County and\n                  Lincoln & Herndon to  collect in Sangamon County.  In addition to being an attorney\n                  for the railroad, Martin was also one of the original incorporators.The spring term of the Madison County Circuit Court opened on March 17, 1851. On March\n                  31, the railroad dismissed thirteen of its suits against delinquent stockholders in\n                  Madison County, probably because the stockholders agreed to pay their remaining installments.\n                  At the time of this letter, twenty-four cases were still pending in the Madison County\n                  Circuit Court.\"An Act to Construct a Railroad from Alton, in Madison County, to Springfield, in\n                     Sangamon County,\" 27 February 1847,Private and Special Laws of Illinois(1847), 144-49; Stock Subscription Book, Document ID: 4967,Alton & Sangamon RR v.
