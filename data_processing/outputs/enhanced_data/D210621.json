He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats.

In the first round of voting Lincoln received\n                  forty-five of the ninety-nine votes cast, but as no candidate received a majority\n                  of votes, nine more rounds of balloting ensued. Richland County Representative Finney\n                  D. Preston  did indeed support his fellow Democrats in the election. In the first\n                  six rounds of voting he supportedJames Shields, and in the final four rounds he voted forJoel A. Matteson. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of\n                  contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Trumbull was victorious\n                  in the tenth vote. See the1854 Federal Election.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G. A., 242-55; Victor B.

According to this broadside there were twenty-oneRepublicans, sixteen Whigs, one anti-Nebraska Whig, and one anti-Nebraska Republican in the Illinois\n                  House of Representatives, and two Whigs, two anti-Nebraska Whigs, and five Republicans\n                  in theIllinois Senate. When Lincoln made his own lists of members of the Nineteenth General Assembly in\n                  anticipation of the Senate election, he agreed with the count of nine Whigs in the\n                  Illinois Senate but calculated only twenty-eight Whigs in the Illinois House of Representatives.\n                  Including anti-Nebraska Democrats, there was indeed an anti-Nebraska majority in the\n                  Nineteenth Illinois General Assembly.“A List of the Members Composing the Nineteenth General Assembly of the State of Illinois,”\n                     broadside in Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Springfield, IL;List of Members of the Illinois Legislature in 1855; List of Members of the Illinois Legislature in 1855; Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.

Archer in the race for U.S. Representative\n                  in Illinois’ Seventh Congressional District by a single vote. While the overall race\n                  was extremely close, Archer did significantly better in the counties in the northern\n                  part of the district than he did in those in the southern part. In the district’s\n                  northern counties ofClark,Coles,Cumberland,Edgar,Logan,Macon,Moultrie, andPiatt, he earned over 50% of the vote in each county, while  in the district’s southern\n                  counties ofClay,Crawford,Effingham,Fayette,Jasper,Lawrence, and Richland, he received less than 50% of the votes cast. In Effingham County,\n                  where Ewington was the county seat, Archer had his worst showing; there he received\n                  only 21.4% of the vote. In Hayward’s home county of Richland, Archer garnered only\n                  35.7% of the vote. While Archer apparently did not campaign in Olney, Allen made a\n                  speech there on the Kansas-Nebraska Act in September 1854. WhigWilliam Harrowof Lawrence County also addressed an assembly of his fellow Whigs at the Richland\n                  County Court House in September on the dangers of supporting anti-Nebraska candidates\n                  and subsequently opined that if Whigs in the southern part of the Seventh District\n                  had to choose between Allen and an anti-Nebraska Whig, they would either vote for\n                  Allen or stay home on election day. Archer ultimately contested the election and Allen\n                  was forced to vacate the seat until a special election was held for the seat in 1856,\n                  which Allen won.Howard W.
