        "text": "2During his presidency, Zachary Taylor was criticized for delegating most decisions\n                  on patronage appointments either to members of his cabinet or to the departments under\n                  which the appointments fell. Although the perception that Taylor was uninvolved in\n                  the selection process for patronage appointments was popular at the time, it was inaccurate.\n                  Taylor indeed delegated authority to his cabinet to make decisions on most appointments.\n                  But he also attended most cabinet meetings where appointments were discussed, personally\n                  oversaw major diplomatic appointments and choice federal appointments inNew York City, overrode Secretary of State John M. Clayton when he disagreed with his selections,\n                  and awarded some of the best patronage positions to his political allies, friends,\n                  and family members. Nevertheless, many saw Taylor’s delegation of decisions on patronage\n                  appointments as a sign of weak leadership as well as a betrayal of his campaign promise\n                  to represent and fight for the interests of the people.Michael F. Holt,The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of\n                        the Civil War(New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 418-19."

        "text": "3This is a reference to Taylor’s actions during the siege of Fort Texas and theBattle of Palo Alto. On May 1, 1846, Taylor left 400 men under the command of Major Jacob Brown to hold\n                  Fort Texas, situated on the northern side of theRio Grande River, while he led the rest of his men on a march to fortify Point Isabel on the Brazos\n                  Santiago Island. In his absence, Mexican troops under the command of GeneralMariano Aristalaid siege to Fort Texas. Following the American victory over Arista’s troops during\n                  the Battle of Palo Alto on May 8, Taylor called a council of war on May 9 to decide\n                  whether to pursue the retreating Mexican army or remain in place. Seven of his ten\n                  officers voted to remain; Taylor overruled this majority and ordered his troops to\n                  advance. His forces successfully routed Arista’s men and reclaimed Fort Texas, which\n                  Taylor renamed Fort Brown. Lincoln expressed admiration for Taylor’s decision both\n                  in this letter to Clayton and when he eulogized Taylor inChicagoin July 1850.John S. D.

        "text": "5“By the Eternal” and “I’ll take the responsibility” were phrases widely associated\n                  with Andrew Jackson at the time. Jackson had developed a reputation for using them\n                  whenever he wished to demonstrate his seriousness or commitment to some action or\n                  principle. Anecdotes from the time, for instance, held that Jackson exclaimed “By\n                  the Eternal the laws must and shall be executed” during theNullification Crisis, and that he replied “I take the responsibility” when challenged on his authority\n                  to transfer U.S. funds from theSecond Bank of the United Statesto state banks during the so-called Bank War.Henry Barrett Chamberlain, “Observations of a Straggler,”The Voter(July 1904), 15:7; Horatio Bateman,Biographies of Two Hundred and Fifty Distinguished National Men(New York: John T.
