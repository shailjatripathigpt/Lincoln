First, he predicted that the States would effectively become debtors to the government,\n                  and they might, in time, combine their numbers in Congress to pass laws relieving\n                  them of their debt. He also believed land speculators would combine to form  large\n                  numbers of  newly-created railroad companies, which would get possession of large\n                  proportions of the public lands, “to aid in the construction of roads not needed,\n                  and which would never be completed.”Cong.
