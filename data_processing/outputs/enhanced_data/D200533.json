Lincoln returned\n                  toIllinoisin October 1848, and spent most of the month canvassing his congressional district\n                  on behalf ofZachary Taylorduring thepresidential campaign of 1848.  Lincoln was in Springfield onelection dayand several other days in November.  He left Springfield for Washington in late November,\n                  so the conversation could have occurred any time during that period.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 20 May 1847, 2:1, 2; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:283-84;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 7 November 1848,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1848-11-07."

Basler,\n                  editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, contends that it was addressed to the War Department, but it is possible that the\n                  recipient wasOliver Diefendorf. A war veteran himself, Diefendorf had established an office in Washington, DC to\n                  settle claims for bounty lands, extra pay, and pensions due soldiers who participated\n                  in the war.  On January 4, 1849, Lincoln and Diefendorf submitted  anaffidaviton behalf of the Newmans.  Presumably Lincoln and Diefendorf appeared together at\n                  the War Department to give testimony in the case.Roy P.
