        "text": "2Brier references the state elections inIllinois, which occurred on November 2, 1858.   Abraham Lincoln, the candidate of theRepublican Party, was challengingStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for seat in theU.S. Senate.   Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat.In the state’s local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in the state, tallying 190,468 votes   to 166,374 for Democrats, a margin of\n                  24,094. Pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly, however,\n                  and Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate.

        "text": "4After the 1858 election, many prominentRepublicansoffered different reasons for Lincoln’s defeat.Joseph Medillblamed unfair apportionment that gave Democrats outsized power in the Illinois General\n                  Assembly.   “If the State had been apportioned according to population,” Medill complained,\n                  “the districts carried by the Republicans would have returned forty-one Lincoln representatives,\n                  and fourteen Lincoln Senators, which of course would have elected him... On a fair\n                  appointment, Douglas would have been beaten seven in the House and three in the Senate.”David Davis,Henry C. Whitney, and others, including Medill,  blamedJohn J. Crittenden, an influential politician and former leader of the defunctWhig Party.  On August 1, Crittenden wroteT. Lyle Dickey,  a former Whig who became a Douglas supporter, confirming a conversation with Dickey\n                  and his praise for Douglas's service to Illinois and his principled position on theLecompton Constitution. Not wishing to be appear \"to be an officious intermeddler\" in the election, Crittenden\n                  requested that Dickey, should he speak of the conversation or letter, \"acquit me of\n                  any intermeddling, or of the presumption of seeking to obtrude myself or my sentiments\n                  upon the attention of the people of Illinois.\" Dickey kept the letter private until\n                  October 19, when he read it aloud in a speech denouncing Lincoln for abandoning Henry\n                  Clay and Whiggery. Crittenden's letter to Dickey and Dickey's speech hurt Lincoln\n                  in the old Whig stronghold of Central Illinois, contributing to Democrats retaining\n                  control of the General Assembly, allowing Douglas to win reelection. Some believed\n                  that voter fraud and the poor weather was to blame for Lincoln’s loss.Despite the loss, Lincoln maintained support from within the Republican party and\n                  few party members placed the blame on him.Chester Dewey, a correspondent for theNew York Evening Post, wrote that Lincoln had “made hosts of warm friends in the East,” whileWilliam H. HannawroteLincoln that  “I give you my hand on the next great fight and when it comes I shall\n                  not fail to be with you.” Lincoln’s conduct in the 1858 campaign immediately created\n                  national support within the party, making him a potential Republican candidate for\n                  president in1860.Allen C. Guelzo,Lincoln and Douglass: The Debates that Defined America, 286-90, 301-3; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:456-57, 542-43, 556-57;  David Davis to Abraham Lincoln; Henry C.
