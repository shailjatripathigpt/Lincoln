        "text": "1This letter is attributed to Abraham Lincoln but is in the hand of Lincolniana collector\n                  Charles W. McClellan. McClellan enclosed this version in his own hand to fellow collector\n                  Judd Stewart in a letter of June 10, 1912. He presumably prepared this text for Stewart\n                  based on theversionof this document in Lincoln’s hand which is now in the collection of Brown University,\n                  to which McClellan’s collection was donated in 1923. Portions of Stewart’s collection,\n                  including this text in McClellan’s hand, were acquired by the Huntington Library in\n                  1921 and 1922. This twentieth-century transcription of the manuscript original in\n                  Lincoln’s hand changes several words from the original, as noted below.The recipient of this letter is conjectured based on the contents of Lincoln’slettertoBenjamin C.
