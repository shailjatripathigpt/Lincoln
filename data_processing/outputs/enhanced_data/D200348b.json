I shall, therefore, consider\n\nthese articles fully answered, when I shall set forth the ungarbled truth, not considering\n\nthe low vulgarities that characterise said articles, worthy of notice, (more particularly theonesigned “AVan BurenSentinel.”) Suffer me, then, in a brief manner, to give the outlines of the meeting\n\nhere on the 22d ult. Pursuant to notice, a large concourse of people (principally whigs,) assembled at\n\nthe Court House. Learning that the self-styleddemocracydesired an opportunity to discuss the principles of the two parties, theClay Clubaddressed a letter to them, inviting them to a fair discussion. They took the proposition\n\nunder advisement, and after a long consultation, “it was considered and adjudged,”\n\nthat they would not accede to the proposition.—Finding that they were unwilling to\n\nenter into a fair discussion, the meeting was called to order by the President of\n\nthe Clay Club.T. M.Killpatrick, Esq. being called on for a speech, commenced by alluding to the day we had met to celebrate,\n\nand passed a eulogy onGeorge Washington, “who died childless, that his country might call him father.”3Mr. K. then called on thelocosto come out and discuss their principles.JudgePearsonbeing present, was prevailed on by some of his party to come forward, but he would\n\nnot agree to have any thing said about Mr.Van Buren. He proposed to discuss some abstract questions. He, however, finally agreed that\n\nMr. Killpatrick might go on and make his speech, and he would answer him. Mr. K.\n\naccordingly went forward, and made a most excellent speech, in an illustration and\n\ndefence of the principles of the whig party, and of the merits ofHenry Clay, in contra-distinction to Mr. Van Buren and his principles. His time having expired,\n\nJudge Pearson followed in a labored harrangue of an hour’s length, attempting to answer the unanswerable arguments of Mr. Killpatrick.\n\nTheJudgelabored hard to prove the unconstitutionality of aUnited States Bank, denouncing all Banks and bank paper; but being asked by Mr.Lincolnif he was in favor of an exclusive metallic currency, (after evading the question\n\nas long as he could,) answered that he was not. The gist of Judge Pearson’s argument on the Bank question, amounted to a condemnation\n\nofWashington, for signing the old United States Bank charter, andMadisonfor approving the late United States Bank bill. He saidWashingtonapproved the Bank charter against the dictates of his better judgment, being over-persuaded\n\nby FederalHamiltonand others. Thus making out “the Father of his county,” who was sworn to preserve,\n\nprotect and defend the constitution, (and who, perhaps, understood it at least, as\n\nwell as theHon. Judge—God forgive him for his imputations upon the memory and character of Washington,)\n\neither as a perjured man, a knave, or a fool! Who will admit either to be true?—This\n\nkind of argument may go down with the self-styled democracy; but never will be received\n\nby any true whig, holding the same principles, and breathing the same spirit as the\n\nwhigs of ‘76.4 Judge Pearson labered arduously to make the impression—boldly asserting—that the Bank of the United States, was a federal measure; that it was chartered\n\nby thefederal party, only a fewrepublicansvoting with them. He must have known better, for the reverse is the fact; but if\n\nhe did it ignorantly, I suppose we will have to excuse him. He was followed by A.Lincoln,Esq. in an able and eloquent speech, characterised by his well known ability. He made\n\na clean shucking of theJudge, pointing out the fallacy of his arguments and disproving most of his statements.\n\nMr. L. made a most able and conclusive argument on the Bank question, proving that\n\nit was no new fangled scheme, but one advocated and carried out by the fathers of\n\nthe Republican school. His speech was received by repeated and rapturous applause. Judge Pearson feeling himself used up, and having no surgeon at hand, wished to bind\n\nup his wounds in the best manner he could. He attempted to harrangue the assembly with his unmeaning bombast, but the people having grown weary, and being\n\ndisgusted with his former effort, dispersed (at least the most part, whigs and locos.)\n\nThe greater portion of those that remained to hear the Judge were whigs; or, as the\n\n“Democrat” correspondent would term them, “decent whigs.” We had a meeting at night, and on the morning of the 23d, addresses were received\n\nfrom Mr. Killpatrick and Mr. Lincoln.
