        "text": "3In aletterto  Lincoln written April 19, 1858 from Chicago,John Wentworthconveyed a rumor that one of theRepublicanmembers of theU.S. CongressfromIllinoishad written a letter encouraging Illinois Republicans to supportStephen A. Douglas’ bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein thefederal election of 1858. Douglas had criticized theLecompton Constitutionand PresidentJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in theDemocratic Party. Some Republicans were excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution\n                  to the extent that they considered backing him for reelection to the U.S. Senate.\n                  Although Douglas later denied it, he courted Republican support. Lincoln and other\n                  Republicans were concerned by these developments and urged fellow party members to\n                  remain loyal to the Republican Party. LincolnwroteWashburne regarding the rumor on April 26, excerpting a portion of Wentworth’s letter,\n                  and assuring Washburne that although suspicion centered on him, Lincoln was confident\n                  the matter was a misunderstanding.The letter causing the controversy was written by Washburne toCharles L. Wilsonon April 12, 1858. In it, Washburne wrote that in light of Douglas’ differences with\n                  the Democratic Party over the Lecompton Constitution, Washburne would consider welcoming\n                  Douglas as an ally to the Republican Party, but that Lincoln must be the Republican\n                  Party’s candidate for the U.S. Senate in Illinois in 1858. Washburne wrote to Lincoln\n                  explaining the matter in letters ofMay 2andMay 6, 1858, enclosing his letter to Wilson in the latter for Lincoln’s review.Russell K.
