        "text": "4The vote Lincoln refers to was onGeorge Ashmun’s amendment to a resolution expressing thanks to GeneralZachary Taylorand his troops.  On January 3, 1848, RepresentativeJohn W. Houstonintroduced ajoint resolutionof thanks to General Taylor and his soldiers.  RepresentativeRobert C. Schenckmoved that the resolution be referred to the Committee on Military Affairs.  RepresentativeThomas J. Henleymoved to amend Schenck’s motion by adding the following: “with instructions to insert\n                  in the said resolution the following: 'engaged as they were, in defending the rights\n                  and honor of the country.’” Ashmun  proposed to amend these instructions by adding\n                  at the end the following: “in a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by\n                  the President of the United States.\"  The House adopted Ashmun’s amendment either\n                  by a vote of eighty-two yeas to eighty-one nays or eighty-five yeas to eighty-one\n                  nays, with Lincoln voting yea. (The HouseJournaland theCongressional Globediffer on the vote tabulation.)   There is no evidence that the House resumed consideration\n                  of this joint resolution or its amendments.  On February 7, 1848, the House passed\n                  ajoint resolutionof thanks to Taylor without Ashmun’s or Henley’s amendments by a vote of 181 yeas\n                  to one nay, with Lincoln voting yea.  The Senate adopted thejoint resolution with amendmentson February 16, and the House concurred in the Senate amendments on May 4.  PresidentJames K. Polkapproved theresolutionin final form on May 9.On December 20, 1847, William A. Richardson proposed three resolutions justifying\n                  the war as “just and necessary,” and “prosecuted with the sole purpose of vindicating\n                  our national rights and honor,” and insisting that the United States “had no alternative,”\n                  in the face of repeated rejections of overture for peace, “but the most vigorous prosecution\n                  of the war, in such manner, consistent with the law of nations, as will make the enemy\n                  feel all its calamities and burthens.”U.S. HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 131-32, 183-85, 365-66, 765, 773, 782; U.S. SenateJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 178-79;Cong.
