    "full_text": "Ciphering Book, In the winter months between his tenth and seventeenth birthdays, Abraham Lincoln\n\nattended four 3-month terms of school in Spencer County, Indiana. At different pioneer\n\nschools operated by different teachers, Lincoln was instructed in the Abbaco method\n\ncommon to the early 19th-century United States. In this business-oriented curriculum,\n\nwhich focused on commerce, weights, and measures, students learned calculations like\n\ninterest and discount before being introduced to decimals or common fractions. Abraham\n\nprocured the paper, prepared the pages at different times throughout those four school\n\nterms, and stitched the sheets together himself. Abraham Lincoln’s ciphering book\n\nnot only provides the earliest example of his handwriting, it also represents the\n\nentirety of his twelve months of formal schooling. Book ownership was rare on the frontier: students instead created workbooks by copying\n\nproblems, questions, and quotations from a text owned by their teacher. For example,\n\nleaf 6 (images 11 and 12) of Lincoln’s ciphering book were copied from Thomas Dilworth’s\n\npopular textbookThe Schoolmaster’s Assistant. There are eleven known sheets from Lincoln’s ciphering book; likely, there were originally\n\nmore. These eleven pages were given by family members to Lincoln’s law partner and\n\nbiographer William H. Herndon after Lincoln’s death in 1865. Currently, the eleven\n\nsheets are owned by twelve different individuals or institutions. The Papers of Abraham\n\nLincoln presents them arranged in the order in which the calculations were taught\n\nin Abbaco schools and textbooks. We have also digitally stitched together leaf 6,\n\nwhose upper and lower halves have become separated and now reside in separate repositories.Nerida F. Ellerton, Valeria Aguirre Holguin, and M. A.
