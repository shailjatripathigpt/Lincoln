        "text": "2This is Abraham Lincoln’s first speech on the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Passage of the\n                  Kansas-Nebraska Act and its effective repeal of the Missouri Compromise reawakened\n                  Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into opposing the act, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the legislation and to rebutStephen A. Douglas’ views on popular sovereignty.  Lincoln also spoke  in support ofRichard Yatesand otheranti-Nebraskacandidates running for theU.S. House of Representativesin the1854 congressional elections. Lincoln spent the days preceding and following this speech inJacksonvillewith Yates, then traveled toCarrolltonto deliver a campaign speech for Yates, returning to Springfield by August 30.
