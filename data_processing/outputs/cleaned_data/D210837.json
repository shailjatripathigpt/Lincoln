        "text": "5Republicans, including Lincoln, opposed the decision in theDred Scott case, which effectively barred any current or future emancipated slave from the right\n                  of United States citizenship and solidified the right of American citizens to transport\n                  their property wherever they wished—including taking an enslaved individual into a\n                  free state—without feared loss of that property. The outcome essentially invalidated\n                  the concept of popular sovereignty, which Stephen A. Douglas argued allowed territorial\n                  and state governments to either allow or prohibit slavery as they saw fit. Lincoln’s\n                  main concern with popular sovereignty had been its power to “allow the people of a\n                  Territory to have Slavery if they want to, but does not allow themnotto have it if they donotwant it.” The Scott decision proved Lincoln’s assertion, to which he remarked, “as\n                  I understand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have\n                  no way of keeping that one man from holding them.”Carl Brent Swisher, \"Dred Scott Case,\"Dictionary of American History, rev. ed.

However, when Douglas celebrated the election of Barret, a supporter of theLecompton Constitution, the newspaper changed course. Barret had run as a regular Democratic nominee rather\n                  than as an anti-Lecompton Democrat, prompting one newspaper to claim that this proved\n                  that Douglas’s rejection of the Lecompton Constitution, “was but a ruse to pull the\n                  wool over the eyes of Republicans andAmericans, and thus secure their votes for his reelection to the Senate.” Accusations of fraud\n                  soon appeared, and Blair contested Barret’s win. After a lengthy examination, the\n                  House of Representatives ordered a new election for the remainder of Barret’s term.\n                  While Barret remained in his seat to finish out his term per the new election, Blair\n                  defeated him for the next term in office.Urbana Union(IL), 12 August 1858, 2:2;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 5 August 1858, 2:1-3;Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1996(Alexandria, VA: CQ Staff Directories, 1997), 622-23;La Grange Weekly National American(MO), 14 August 1858, 2:3; L.

CrittendenwroteLincoln on July 29, 1858, admitting that he and Douglas, though always belonging\n                  to different political parties and were \"opposed, in politics, to each other,\" shared\n                  a strong aversion to the Lecompton Constitution. Buchanan administration's harsh response\n                  to Douglas and use of its power to prevent his reelection brought sympathy from Crittenden.\n                  He wrote of Douglas, \"I could not but wish for his success— and his triumph over such\n                  a persecution– I thought that his reelection was necessary as a rebuke to the Administration,\n                  and a vindication of the great cause of popular rights & public justice.\"   Expressing\n                  \"no disposition for officious intermeddling\" in hisletterto Lincoln, Crittenden nonetheless became embroiled in the campaign for the U.S.\n                  Senate.  On July 19,T. Lyle Dickey, a former Whig and Lincoln supporter who had defected to the Democrats and Douglas,\n                  wrote Crittenden requesting that he confirm a conversation with Dickey in April 1858\n                  where Crittenden praised Douglas.  On August 1, Crittenden wrote Dickey confirming\n                  the conversation and his praise for Douglas's service to Illinois and his principled\n                  position on the Lecompton Constitution.  Not wishing to be appear \"to be an officious\n                  intermeddler\" in the election, Crittenden requested that Dickey, should he speak of\n                  the conversation or letter, \"acquit  me of any intermeddling, or of the presumption\n                  of seeking to obtrude myself or my sentiments upon the attention of the people of\n                  Illinois.\" Dickey kept the letter private until October 19, when he read it aloud\n                  in a speech denouncing Lincoln for abandoningHenry Clayand Whiggery.  TheDaily Illinois State Journalsought to mitigate the damage by claiming that Crittenden's letter to Dickey was\n                  a forgery and by suggesting the Crittenden had written Lincoln--presumably Crittenden'sletterof July 29--supporting opposition against Douglas.  TheDaily Missouri Republicandemanded that Lincoln publish this letter, which caused Crittenden, hewroteLincoln on October 27, \"much pain & surprise.\"   TheIllinois State Journalcontinued to misrepresent Crittenden's correspondence to Lincoln, prompting Owen\n                  G. Cates of St. Louis to write Crittenden asking if he wrote such a letter.  On October\n                  28, Crittenden responded in a telegram: \"I have written no such letter.\" Crittenden's\n                  letter to Dickey, Dickey's speech, and Crittenden's subsequent telegram hurt Lincoln\n                  in the old Whig stronghold of central Illinois, contributing to Lincoln's loss to\n                  Douglas.David Davis,Henry C. Whitney, and others blamed Crittenden for Lincoln's defeat, and Lincoln himself, in aletterto Crittenden dated November 4,  claimed that the use of Crittenden's name \"contributed\n                  largely\" to his loss.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:456-57, 542-43, 546-47; Allen C.
