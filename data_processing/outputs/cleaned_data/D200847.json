        "text": "2It is possible that John Sizemore, Sr. incurred this debt in relation to a legal case\n                  in which Abraham Lincoln served as one of his attorneys. In 1846, Sizemore had theEdgar County Circuit Courtdeclare his thirty-year-old son, Joshua Sizemore, insane.  In November 1850, the\n                  court appointedGeorge W. Mokeas Joshua’s conservator and charged him with the management of Joshua’s real and\n                  personal property, which was valued at $400.  In April 1851, John Sizemore, Sr. retained\n                  Lincoln,Usher F. Linder, andMilton M. Dilland sued Moke in an action of assumpsit. John was suing to recover $300, for expenses\n                  he incurred caring for Joshua between the time he was declared insane and Moke was\n                  appointed conservator.  In May 1852, the jury found for John Sizemore, Sr. and awarded\n                  $260 from Joshua’s estate.Order, Document ID: 37702; Declaration, Document ID: 37709,Sizemore v. Moke, Martha L.

        "text": "3It is also possible that John Henderson’s debt to Lincoln related to a legal case\n                  in which Lincoln served as  one of his attorneys. In 1849, Henderson sold William\n                  Reed a stallion for $175.  Reed paid $25 and gave Henderson a promissory note for\n                  $150.  After Reed failed to pay the note, Henderson retained Lincoln andKirby Benedict, and, in October 1851, sued Reed in an action of assumpsit in the Edgar County Circuit\n                  Court for $300 in damages.  Reed claimed that Henderson promised the stallion was\n                  a “good covering horse and foal getter,” but it proved to be “entirely worthless”\n                  as a stud.
