        "text": "1TheBloomington Pantagraphpublished this summary of remarks by Abraham Lincoln as part of a longer description\n                  of campaign appearances by Stephen A. Douglas as the latter traveled betweenBloomingtonandSpringfield. No manuscript version of Lincoln’s remarks has been located. TheDaily Illinois State Journalprinted anextractof this summary on July 21, 1858.Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Douglas to representIllinoisin the U.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  efforts in the1858 election campaignon the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Lincoln had traveled from Springfield to Bloomington on the day preceding this and\n                  attended Douglas’ speech in Bloomington that evening. After attending the speech by\n                  Douglas in Atlanta on July 17 at which he made these remarks, Lincoln returned to\n                  Springfield, where he delivered a speech of his own in the evening.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-58, 476-77; Allen C.\n                     Guelzo, “Houses Divided: Lincoln, Douglas, and the Political Landscape of 1858,”The Journal of American History94 (September 2007), 392-94, 400-401;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 16 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-16; 17 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-17;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois."
