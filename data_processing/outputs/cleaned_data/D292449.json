        "text": "2InIllinois’ Seventh Congressional District in the1854 Federal Election,DemocratJames C. Allen narrowly won an intensely competitive race againstRepublicanWilliam B. Archer. The contest came down to a single vote: Allen received 8,452 votes\n                  to Archer’s 8,451. Allen received the certificate of election, but Archer contested\n                  the outcome. TheU.S. House of Representativesreferred the issue to its Committee on Elections.  The committee investigated the\n                  matter throughout the spring of 1856, and in May, it issued a majority report and\n                  resolutions affirming that Archer, not Allen, was the rightful winner of the election.\n                  In July, the House took up the report and resolutions.  On July 18, the House adopted\n                  a resolution affirming that Allen had not won the election and was not entitled to\n                  the seat but rejected a resolution affirming that Archer had won the election and\n                  was entitled to the seat.  At an impasse, the House nullified the results and left\n                  the seat vacant until a new election could be held. In August 1856, Allen defeated\n                  Archer in a special election.The “some three or four miserable devils on our side” Washburne references were members\n                  of theOppositionthat voted yea on the Allen resolution but nay on the Archer resolution.  Of the\n                  ninety-one representatives voting against the Archer resolution, sixty-one were Democrats,\n                  twenty-two wereKnow-Nothings, and eight were members of the Opposition Party.  Of the seven Opposition representatives,\n                  four--Timothy C. Day, Solomon G. Haven, Oscar F. Moore, and Job R. Tyson--voted yea\n                  on the Allen resolution and nay on the Archer resolution.  Washburne’s hope for “political\n                  damnation” was fulfilled: none of the four won reelection to the Thirty-Fifth Congress,\n                  and none even served another term in the House of Representatives.Howard W.
