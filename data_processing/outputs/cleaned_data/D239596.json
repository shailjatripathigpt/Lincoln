        "text": "2John Olney, a lawyer, appears to be considering a lawsuit stemming from another case\n                  on the docket for April 1858 in theSangamon County Circuit Court,Doup v. Gibson et al. In that case, Samuel C. Gibson and Ninian E. Primm partnered with Daniel Doup to\n                  buy land inIllinois, including one thousand acres in Gallatin andPulaskicounties. They agreed to divide taxes and profit based on respective interests. However,\n                  Primm died and Doup bought out Gibson, while also claiming that Primm still owed him\n                  $1,387. Doup hired Lincoln andWilliam H. Herndonas his attorneys and sued Primm’s heirs, requesting the court to sell Primm’s land\n                  to pay him back. Olney is likely referencing the land that Doup owned in Gallatin\n                  County.Doup v. Gibson et al.continued until February 1860; Primm’s heirs failed to appear, and the court ruled\n                  in favor of Doup.The Bench and Bar of Chicago: Biographical Sketches(Chicago: American Biographical, [1883]), 621-22;Doup v.
