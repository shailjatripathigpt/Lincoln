    "full_text": "Whig Protest in Illinois Legislature Against the Reorganization of the Judiciary,\n\n26 February 18411 PROTEST. The genius and the policy of Republican institutions alike indicate the wisdom and\n\nthe necessity of a frequent appeal to the people. It is thus, and thus only that\n\nthe misconduct of their Representatives may be rebuked, and when the guards of our\n\nConstitution, and the sacred rights of minorities are trampled under foot, the time\n\nhas arrived for the appeal and the decision. The undersigned, members of the presentGeneral Assembly, have witnessed with regret and indignation, the passage of thelawfor the re-organization of the Judiciary.2Their earnest and repeated efforts to defeat it have been unavailing, and already\n\nthe din of the degrading contest for its offices and emoluments, sounds mournfully\n\nin the ear of patriotism. To the majority of aLegislaturewhose idol is party supremacy, we have addressed our reasons in vain.3Announced as a party measure for party purposes, it has been strengthened by the\n\nstartling admission, and it only remains for us to present to the people and the country,\n\nthe causes of our opposition, and our opinion of the results. Our great objection to thisbillis, that it is uncalled for by public opinion, or public convenience. Thebillprovides for the repeal of all thecircuit courts, and for the election of five additional Supreme Judges, who, together with the present\n\nSupreme Judges, are required to hold circuit courts.4 This is an entire change in our Judiciary system. By what necessity is it justified,\n\nor by what emergency is it required? Does it cause more courts to be held, or more\n\ncauses to be decided? Will delays of justice be obviated, or justice brought nearer\n\nto any man’s door? To all these questions, the answer must be, no. There are still\n\nbut nine circuit judges.—They at least can perform no more duty by being Supreme Judges.\n\nThey can travel no further, endure no more, sleep no less; for at best they are but\n\nmen; and whoever for a moment examines, will see, that thisbill, so far from aiding the speedy administration of justice, must, by imposing new and\n\nincreased duties upon the judges presiding on the circuits, most materially delay\n\nand impede it. Since the adoption of the circuit system in 1834, the need of additional circuits\n\nhas been constantly increasing, and gradually supplied.5Our population has doubled, our business has increased in a still greater proportion,\n\nand the creation of new circuits, so as to keep pace with this advance, has been demanded\n\nby the people, and performed by the Legislature.—There can be no doubt that a continuance\n\nin this course would have proved for the future, as it has done for the past, convenient,\n\neconomical, and satisfactory. But if this change has not been called for by public convenience, still less has it\n\nbeen demanded by public opinion. When the Legislature assembled in advance of the\n\nusual time, the public mind was turned with feverish anxiety to the condition of the\n\nState, and the course of its rulers; an increased debt; an empty treasury. Ourinternal improvement systema wretched skeleton, railroads half finished, or half decayed; iron without roads,\n\nand roads without iron; thecanalso surrounded with difficulties that even its truest friends were almost found “to stop, too fearful, and too faint to go.”6Our scrip, issued on the faith of theState, spreading like leaves, every where, and like leaves almost valueless.7These were some of the difficulties of our condition, and these it was supposed,\n\nrequired our utmost wisdom and patriotism. But while thus surrounded by clouds of\n\nmisfortune, there was one part of the State administration against which there was\n\nno complaint, and in which almost alone, no change was required. Need we say this\n\nwas our system of circuit courts, established after various trials, conforming itself\n\nto the condition and increase of our population, and approved by the experience of\n\nall the surrounding States. How strange, how unaccountable must it appear, that while\n\nall the rest of these great interests remaining unprotected, almost untouched, this\n\nsystem of circuit courts has been attacked and destroyed. Yet, if unjust and unwise\n\nas we believe it to be, public opinion, the great moving principle of free government,\n\nhad indicated this change, we would have yielded obedience to its dictates, or at\n\nleast bowed in submission to its authority. But this was not the case. In the canvass\n\npreceding thelate election, excited and heated as it was, the subject was undiscussed, the change was not proposed,\n\nand even when it was known that there was a large majority ofVan Burenmen in either branch of the Legislature. Up to this moment, no petition, no complaint\n\nupon this subject has invited the attention of thisbody, or asked for its Legislation to destroy our Judiciary system. Thus unasked, unrequired, thebillhas been ushered into existence, not merely in advance, but in defiance of that public\n\nwill for which its supporters always profess such profound respect. Nor is the manner in which thisbillhas been sustained, less remarkable. It was preceded by the statement that the destruction\n\nof the existing system was to be followed by the creation of inferior tribunals, by\n\nwhich the public interests would be advanced. Their jurisdiction, their judges, their\n\nlocation, were left to the imaginations of those whose votes were necessary; and if\n\nvisions of judicial dignity burst upon their excited fancy, and furnished powerful\n\nreasons in support of thebillthey were called upon to pass, it might well be called a master stroke of policy,\n\nif not of morals, to suggest the idea. Nor were the spoils of victory to be disregarded.—Scattered\n\nin every county of the State, the new clerkships might tempt avarice, and excite ambition,\n\nor at least afford a safe, if not honorable retreat from the indignation of the people. But, as if these reasons were still insufficient, the genius of its friends were called\n\ninto brilliant exercise in rousing the spirit of party; and the dominant party were\n\ncalled to its support in the name ofDemocracy, as if the spirit of Democracy could animate a measure remarkable only for its supreme\n\ncontempt for the popular will, or stern determination to usurp power. It was thus\n\nthe Democracy were called on to rally to its support, and it was unblushingly avowed\n\nas its object, to obtain a Democratic majority in theSupreme Court, that they might decide questions of law according to the principles of Democracy,\n\nor in other words, according to the will of the party in power. It was by these and\n\nkindred means that the bare constitutional majority was obtained, and thus the independence\n\nof the Judiciary, the surest shield of public welfare and private right, has been\n\nbrought to abject submission at the feet of Legislative authority. We have not been neglectful of our duty in warning the majority of the dangers of\n\nthese violations of the spirit of the Constitution. We have pointed to the care with\n\nwhich the Constitution has guarded the rights of the Judiciary. We have remonstrated\n\nagainst this evasive mode of removing Judges who are expressly required by the Constitution\n\nto be commissioned during good behaviour. We have asked that if criminal or incompetent, they should be removed by address\n\nor impeachment, the only modes known to the Constitution; and we have deprecated\n\nin earnest but respectful terms, an arbitrary exercise of power which may soon become\n\nthe precedent for still more flagrant violations of right and justice. But we have\n\nstriven in vain; the torrent of party prejudices has borne down our objections, and we can only hope that in the majesty of the popular will\n\nit may find a barrier sufficient to impede its course and stay its mischief. We desire to say also that we consider this a fit occasion to express our conviction\n\nof the great injury thisbillwill cause to our character as a State. We have arrived at a critical period in\n\nour history; we seem to be surrounded by adverse circumstances well fitted to try\n\nour public faith and individual virtue. It would be the greatest, as we trust it\n\nmay be the last evil we could endure, to lose our rank among States, and stand disgraced\n\namid the fair sisters of our confederacy. But if, to the calamities to which we are\n\nalready subject, and which direct painful attention to our course, is to be added\n\na party Judiciary, made by one party, and for one party, and of one party, who that\n\nloves his country does not painfully perceive the deep but certain degradation which\n\nawaits us. Nor do we think the influence of thisbillless pernicious in its more immediate results; that there will be a lamentable want\n\nof confidence in our courts, we firmly believe; nor indeed can it be otherwise. Whoever\n\nmay be selected as Judges under thisbillmust feel that they receive their offices from party domination, for party purposes,\n\nand the lofty independence so becoming to a judge cannot exist; the will of the party\n\nand the success of the party must be in their thoughts, and if it were possible to\n\nsuppose it otherwise, how will they stand with the community? Will they not be subject\n\nto the galling but continual imputation, to the burden of a suspicion, justified,\n\nif not by their conduct, at least by their position; baneful and miserable must the\n\ntendencies of this measure be, since our courts, if not corrupt, must be suspected,\n\nand the streams of justice tinged, if not by the impurity of the fountain, by the\n\njaundiced vision of the beholder. There are some of the undersigned who witnessed in another State the fearful consequences\n\nof a similar interference with the courts by the Legislative authority. They saw\n\nthere a contest thus produced which for bitterness and ferocity has seldom been equalled; they witnessed the whole framework of society shaken, justice denied, delayed, and\n\nbrought into disrepute; crime stalking unrebuked and unpunished, and the best interests\n\nof a community shattered or crushed, and they cannot remain silent when an attempt\n\nis made which being intended for similar purposes, may produce similar results.8 For the reasons thus presented, and for others no less apparent, the undersigned cannot\n\nassent to the passage of thebill, or permit it to become a law without this evidence of their disapproval; and they\n\nnow protest against the passage of abillfor the re-organization of the Judiciary; because, First. It violates the great principles of the government by subjecting the Judiciary\n\nto the Legislature; Second. It is a fatal blow at the independence of the Judges, and the constitutional\n\nterm of their office; Third. It is a measure not asked for, or wished for by the people; Fourth. It will greatly increase the expense of our courts, or else greatly diminish\n\ntheir utility; Fifth. It will give our courts a political and partizan character, thereby impairing public confidence in their decisions; Sixth. It will impair our standing in the opinion of other States, and the world; Seventh. It is a party measure, for party purposes, from which no practical good\n\nto the people can possibly arise, but which may be the source of innumerable evils. The undersigned are well aware that this protest will be altogether unavailing with\n\nthe majority of this body. The blow has already fallen, and we are compelled to stand\n\nby the mournful spectators of the ruin it will cause. But we cannot do otherwise\n\nthan point out the danger of this measure, its impolicy and its usurpation, in order,\n\nat least, that the despotism of a momentary majority may not become a precedent for\n\nsucceeding enormities, or future crimes. We have thus accomplished our only remaining duty on this painful subject, and we\n\ncommit the final decision of this great question to the judgment and justice of the\n\npeople. We have struggled ineffectually to guard<Page 5>the principles of our government from unhallowed innovation, and we now submit this\n\ngreat question to our constituents, and the country. As Representatives, we can\n\ndo no more; as citizens, we shall be found where we have ever been, contending for\n\nthe supremacy of the Constitution. Nor are we without our great consolation; there is a spirit in the people, sometimes\n\nslumbering, but never extinct, which, when thoroughly aroused by usurpation or tyranny,\n\nwill overwhelm the usurper and his devices in an undistinguished ruin; nor can they\n\nlong escape this generous indignation, who prostitute the power bestowed by the people\n\nto unworthy ends or selfish purposes. When that spirit shall kindle in its might,\n\nand rebuke the authors and abettors of this plan, we may rely upon this protest as\n\na proof of our fidelity to the cause of the country, and a shield against the indignation\n\nof the people.9",

        "text": "2On February 10, 1841, the General Assembly overrode the objections of theCouncil of Revisionand passed thejudiciary act. Two politically contentious issues led the General Assembly to pass alawto reorganize the state judiciary.  The first was a test case in theJo Daviess County Circuit Court,Spraggins v. Houghton, a Whig Party challenge of an election in which an unnaturalized Irish immigrant\n                  cast a ballot. The court ruled against Spraggins, the election judge who had permitted\n                  the vote; andStephen A. Douglas, a Democrat, took the case on appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. Believing that\n                  the Whig-dominated court (consisting of WhigsWilliam Wilson,Samuel D. Lockwood, andThomas C. Browneand DemocratTheophilus W. Smith) would decide the case on political principal, Douglas obtained a continuance for\n                  after the November election. The second issue was the refusal of Illinois Secretary\n                  of StateAlexander P. Field, a Whig, to vacate his office when Democratic GovernorThomas Carlinsought to replace him with a Democrat,John A. McClernand. The Illinois Supreme Court sustained Field's position, and Illinois Whigs claimed\n                  that as long as there was no vacancy in the office, the governor had no legal authority\n                  to make a new appointment. The Whigs interpreted the secretary of state’s position\n                  as a check on the executive office. Democrats contended that the secretary of state\n                  served at the pleasure of the incumbent governor, that the office was not a lifetime\n                  appointment, and that it should act as a right-hand of the governor and not a check\n                  upon him. All of this political controversy played a role in the1840 state election. Field, called King Alexander I in the Democratic press, was unpopular with Illinois\n                  voters, and so was the Whig Party's support of him. The Whig's opposition to foreign\n                  voters, who tended to vote along Democratic lines, was also an unpopular position\n                  among the electorate. TheAugust election, therefore, resulted in a Democratic majority in the Illinois General Assembly, in\n                  sharp contrast to Whig dominance in the federal election. When legislature convened\n                  on November 23, 1840, the Democrats sought to removed the obstacle of the Whig-dominated\n                  Supreme Court with thejudiciary bill, whichAdam W. Snyderintroduced in theSenateon December 10.   Meanwhile, Governor Carlin nominated Stephen A. Douglas as secretary\n                  of state, and the Senate confirmed the nomination. When it became obvious that thejudiciary billwould pass, Field finally acquiesced and resigned his position.John Palmer,\n                     ed.,The Bench and Bar of Illinois: Historical and Reminiscent(Chicago: Lewis, 1899), 1:31; Charles Manfred Thompson,The Illinois Whigs before 1846(Urbana: University of Illinois, 1915),  79-88; Robert W.

When the Legislature assembled in advance of the\n               usual time, the public mind was turned with feverish anxiety to the condition of the\n               State, and the course of its rulers; an increased debt; an empty treasury.  Ourinternal improvement systema wretched skeleton, railroads half finished, or half decayed; iron without roads,\n               and roads without iron; thecanalso surrounded with difficulties that even its truest friends were almost found “to stop, too fearful, and too faint to go.”6Our scrip, issued on the faith of theState, spreading like leaves, every where, and like leaves almost valueless.7These were some of the difficulties of our condition, and these it was supposed,\n               required our utmost wisdom and patriotism.  But while thus surrounded by clouds of\n               misfortune, there was one part of the State administration against which there was\n               no complaint, and in which almost alone, no change was required.  Need we say this\n               was our system of circuit courts, established after various trials, conforming itself\n               to the condition and increase of our population, and approved by the experience of\n               all the surrounding States.  How strange, how unaccountable must it appear, that while\n               all the rest of these great interests remaining unprotected, almost untouched, this\n               system of circuit courts has been attacked and destroyed.  Yet, if unjust and unwise\n               as we believe it to be, public opinion, the great moving principle of free government,\n               had indicated this change, we would have yielded obedience to its dictates, or at\n               least bowed in submission to its authority.  But this was not the case.  In the canvass\n               preceding thelate election, excited and heated as it was, the subject was undiscussed, the change was not proposed,\n               and even when it was known that there was a large majority ofVan Burenmen in either branch of the Legislature.  Up to this moment, no petition, no complaint\n               upon this subject has invited the attention of thisbody, or asked for its Legislation to destroy our Judiciary system."
