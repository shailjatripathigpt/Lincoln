        "text": "1TheDaily Illinois State Journalextracted this report of remarks by Abraham Lincoln from the original printedversionwhich appeared in the   BloomingtonDaily Pantagraphon July 17, 1858. TheDaily Illinois State Journalpreceded these remarks with a summary of Stephen A. Douglas’ recent public appearances\n                  as he traveled fromChicagotoSpringfield, in which the newspaper painted his early efforts in thesenatorial campaign of 1858as unsuccessful. The newspaper then included a brief description of Douglas’ July\n                  16, 1858 arrival and speech in Bloomington, following which Lincoln made these comments.\n                  No manuscript version of Lincoln’s remarks has been located.Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  efforts in the 1858 election campaign on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Lincoln arrived in Bloomington from Springfield on this date and listened to Douglas’\n                  speech in the evening. On the following morning he attended another speech by Douglas\n                  inAtlanta, at which he similarly declined to speak when pressed. Later in the day on July 17\n                  he returned to Springfield, where he delivered a speech of his own in the evening.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-58, 476-77; Allen C.\n                     Guelzo, “Houses Divided: Lincoln, Douglas, and the Political Landscape of 1858,”The Journal of American History94 (September 2007), 392-94, 400-401;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 16 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-16; 17 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-17;Summary of Remarks at Atlanta, Illinois;Summary of Remarks at Atlanta, Illinois; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois."
