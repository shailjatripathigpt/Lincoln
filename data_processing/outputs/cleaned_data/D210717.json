        "text": "3Smith is presumably continuing the discussion from his previousletteron candidates for the Eighteenth Illinois Senate District, which includedColes,Cumberland,Edgarand Vermilion counties, and the Twenty-Fourth Illinois House District, which was\n                  contiguous with Edgar County. In correspondence in late  May and early June, Lincoln\n                  was informed thatThomas A. MarshallandJames Steelewere the likely Republican candidates in these respective races and he may have communicated\n                  these names to Smith. Marshall was indeed selected as the Republican candidate for\n                  the Eighteenth Illinois Senate District, and he defeated DemocratUsher F. Linderin the election of 1858. Steele, however, declined to be a candidate for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandRobert Moseleywas instead nominated at an Edgar County Republican convention held in September\n                  1858. Moseley also won his office, defeating DemocratCharles Summersby a vote of 1,453 to 1,400.Lincoln was interested in the outcome of races for the Illinois House of Representatives\n                  and theIllinois Senateas he intended to challenge incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate, and at this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected   the state’s U.S. senators. Not long after the date of this letter, Lincoln\n                  was nominated to be the Republican Party’s U.S. Senate candidate at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionon June 16. When the election for U.S. senator was held in the General Assembly in\n                  January 1859, both Marshall and Moseley voted for Lincoln. While Lincoln received\n                  forty-six votes in the General Assembly, Douglas received fifty-one votes and retained\n                  the seat.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 219, 222;George W.

        "text": "4Lincoln and Douglas focused their 1858 campaign efforts on the former Whig stronghold\n                  of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest. Among the\n                  former Whigs whose votes were courted were those who had moved into theAmerican Partyfollowing the dissolution of the Whig Party. In the Eighteenth Illinois Senate District,\n                  Vermilion County was considered to be safely Republican, but in the southern portion\n                  of the district, Coles and Edgar counties were located in the former “Whig belt” of\n                  Illinois, and Cumberland County leaned Democratic. Smith’s preference for a state\n                  senate candidate from the southern portion of the district, and for candidates who\n                  had formerly been members of either the Whig or American parties was informed by an\n                  understanding of the need to win over voters who might be reluctant to support Republican\n                  candidates. The Republican candidates selected in these races aligned with this strategy;\n                  Illinois Senate candidate Marshall was from Coles County, and Marshall and Moseley\n                  were both Whigs before they became Republicans.Allen C.

        "text": "5Smith is referencing the 1858 electoral race in the Third Congressional District of\n                  Illinois, of which his home county of Vermilion was a part. Owen Lovejoy was up for\n                  reelection to theU.S. House of Representativesand some of the more conservative Republicans of the district sought to replace him\n                  due to his reputation as an abolitionist. Among those who opposed Lovejoy’s reelection\n                  were Lincoln’s friends and alliesDavid Davis,Leonard Swett,T. Lyle Dickey, andWard H. Lamon. Lincoln, however, recognized the importance of Lovejoy’s supporters to his own ambition\n                  to be elected to the U.S. Senate, and had himselfwarnedLovejoy as early as March 1858 to be wary of the possibility of Democrats recruiting\n                  a Republican to run against him. Attempts from conservative Republicans and Democrats\n                  to either replace Lovejoy as the Republican candidate or challenge him with an independent\n                  opponent continued to be a concern throughout the campaign of 1858. Despite these\n                  efforts, Lovejoy was unanimously nominated for reelection at the district Republican\n                  convention inJolieton June 30, and was returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1858 with 57.7\n                  percent of the vote, defeating Douglas Democrat George W. Armstrong who garnered 38.8 percent andBuchananDemocrat David Le Roy who received 3.4 percent.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.
