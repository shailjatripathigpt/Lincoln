He had purchased  the parcel from his stepson John D. Johnston for $50 on  December\n                  31, 1840. On October 25, 1841, Abraham Lincolnpurchasedthe parcel for $200. The conditions of the purchase  made it amount to a cash gift\n                  to his father and stepmother, who retained the use of the land throughout their lives.\n                  After the death of Thomas Lincoln in 1851, John D. Johnston requested that Lincoln\n                  sell his 40 acres, all that remained of his stepmother’s farm, to a local farmer.\n                  Lincoln refused, and legally retained the title to the land throughout his life. John\n                  J. Hall, who had purchased the west 80 acres, cultivated this tract along with his\n                  own, and he acquired legal title to it in 1888.Harry E.
