    "full_text": "\"Rebecca\" to the Editor of the Sangamo Journal, 27 August 18421 Letter from the Lost Townships.2 I see you printed that long letter I sent you a spell ago3—I’m quite encouraged by it, and can’t keep from writing again. I think the printing\n\nof my letters will be a good thing all round, —it will give me the benefit of being\n\nknown by the world, and give the world the advantage of knowing what’s going on in\n\nthe Lost Townships, and give your paper respectability besides. So here come another.—Yesterday\n\nafternoon I hurried through cleaning up the dinner dishes, and stepped over to neighbor\n\nS—to see if his wife Peggy was as well as mought be expected, and hear what they called the baby. Well, when I got there, and just\n\nturned round the corner of his log cabin, there he was setting on the door-step reading\n\na newspaper. ‘How are you Jeff,’ says I,—he sorter started when he heard me, for he hadn’t seen\n\nme before. ‘Why,’ says he, ‘I’m mad as the devil, aunt Becca.’ ‘What about,’ says I, ‘aint its hair the right color? None of that nonsense, Jeff—there\n\naint an honester woman in the Lost Township than—’ ‘Than who?’ says he, ‘what the mischief are you about?’ I began to see I was running the wrong trail, and so says I, ‘O nothing, I guess I\n\nwas mistaken a little, that’s all. But what is it you’re mad about?’ ‘Why,’ says he, ‘I’ve been tugging ever since harvest getting out wheat and hauling\n\nit to the river, to raiseState Bankpaper enough to pay my tax this year, and a little school debt I owe; and now just\n\nas I’ve got it, here I open this infernal ExtraRegister, expecting to find it full of “glorious democratic victories,” and “High Comb’d Cocks,”\n\nwhen, lo and behold, I find a set of fellows calling themselvesofficers of State, have forbidden the tax collectors and school commissioners to receive State paper\n\nat all; and so here it is, dead on my hands.4I don’t now believe all the plunder I’ve got will fetch ready cash enough to pay\n\nmy taxes and that school debt.’ I was a good deal thunderstruck myself; for that was the first I had heard of the\n\nproclamation, and my old man was pretty much in the same fix with Jeff. We both stood\n\na moment, staring at one another without knowing what to say. At last says I, ‘Mr.\n\nS—let me look at that paper.’ He handed it to me, when I read the proclamation over. ‘There now,’ says he, ‘did you ever see such a piece of impudence and imposition as\n\nthat?’ I saw Jeff was in a good tune for saying some ill-natured things, and so I\n\ntho’t I would just argue a little on the contrary side, and make him rant a spell if I\n\ncould. ‘Why,’ says I, looking as dignified and thoughtful as I could, ‘it seems pretty tough\n\nto be sure, to have to raise silver where there’s none to be raised; but then you\n\nsee “there will be danger of loss” if it aint done.’5 ‘Loss, damnation!’ says he, ‘I defyDaniel Webster, I defyKing Solomon, I defy the world, —I defy—I defy—yes, I defy even you, aunt Becca, to show how the\n\npeople can lose any thing by paying their taxes inStatepaper.’ ‘Well,’ says I, ‘you see what theofficers of Statesay about it, and they are a desarnin set of men.’ ‘But,’ says I, ‘I guess you’re\n\nmistaken about what the proclamation says; it don’t saythe peoplewill lose any thing by the paper money being taken for taxes. It only says “there will be danger of loss,” and though it is tolerable plain that the people can’t lose by paying their taxes\n\nin something they can get easier than silver, instead of having to pay silver; and\n\nthough it is just as plain, that the State can’t lose by taking State Bank paper,\n\nhowever low it may be, while she owes the Bank more than the whole revenue, and can\n\npay that paper over on her debt, dollar for dollar; stillthere is danger of lossto the “officers of State,” and you know Jeff, we can’t get along withoutofficers of State. ‘Damn officers of State,’ says he, ‘that’s what youwhigsare always hurraing for.’ ‘Now don’t swear so Jeff,’ says I, ‘you know I belong to the meetin, and swearin\n\nhurts my feelins.’6‘Beg pardon, aunt Becca,’ says he, ‘but I do say its enough to makeDr. Goddardswear, to have tax to pay in silver, for nothing only thatFordmay get his two thousand a year, andShieldshis twenty four hundred a year, andCarpenterhis sixteen hundred a year, and all without ‘danger of loss’ by taking it in State\n\npaper.’7‘Yes, yes, it’s plain enough now what theseofficers of Statemean by ‘danger of loss.’ ‘Wash, I ‘spose, actually lost fifteen hundred dollars out of the three thousand that two\n\nof these ‘officers of State’ let him steal from the Treasury, by ompelled to take it in State paper.’—onder if we don’t have a proclamation before long, commanding us to make up this loss\n\nto Wash in silver.’8 And so he went on, till his breath run out, and he had to stop. I couldn’t think\n\nof any thing to say just then: and so I begun to look over the paper again. ‘Aye!\n\nhere’s another proclamation, or something like it.’ ‘Another!’ says Jeff, ‘and whose\n\negg is it, pray?’ I looked to the bottom of it, and read aloud, ‘Your obedient servant,\n\n‘Jas Shields, Auditor.’ ‘Aha!’ says Jeff, ‘one of them same three fellows again. Well read it, and let’s hear\n\nwhat of it.’ I read on till I came to where it says, “The object of this measure is to suspend the collection of the revenue for the current\n\nyear.’9‘Now stop, now stop,’ says he, ‘that’s a lie aready, and I don’t want to hear of it.’ ‘O may be not,’ says I. ‘I sayit—is—a—lie.—Suspend the collection, indeed! Will the collectors that have taken their oaths\n\nto make the collectiondareto suspend it? Is there any thing in the law requiring them to perjure themselves\n\nat the bidding of Jas. Shields? Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowinghiminstead of allthemif they should venture to obey him? And would he not discover some ‘danger of loss’\n\nand be off, about the time it came to taking their places?’ ‘And suppose the people attempt to suspend by refusing to pay, what then? The collectors\n\nwould just jerk up their horses, and cows, and the like, and sell them to the highest\n\nbidder for silver in hand, without valuation or redemption. Why, Shields didn’t believe\n\nthat story himself—it was never meant for the truth. If it was true, why was it not\n\nwrit till five days after the proclamation? Why didn’tCarlinand Carpenter sign it as well as Shields?10Answer me that, aunt Becca. I say its a lie, and not a well told one at that. It\n\ngrins out like a copper dollar. Shields is a fool as well as a liar. With him truth\n\nis out of the question, and as for getting a good bright passable lie out of him,\n\nyou might as well try to strike fire from a cake of tallow. I stick to it, its all\n\nan infernal whig lie.’ ‘Awhiglie,—Highty! Tighty!!’ ‘Yes, awhiglie; and its just like every thing the cursed British whigs do. First they’ll do\n\nsome devilment, and then they’ll tell a lie to hide it. And they don’t care how plain\n\na lie it is; they think they can cram any sort of a one down the throats of the ignorantloco focos, as they call thedemocrats.’ ‘Why, Jeff, you’re crazy—you don’t mean to say Shields is a whig.’ ‘Yes I do.’ “Why, look here, the proclamation is in your own democratic paper as you call it.’ ‘I know it, and what of that? They only printed it to let us democrats see the deviltry\n\nthe whigs are at.’ ‘Well, but Shields is the Auditor of this loco—I mean this democratic State.’ ‘So he is, andTylerappointed him to office.’11 ‘Tyler appointed him?’ ‘Yes (if you must chaw it over) Tyler appointed him, or if it wasn’t him it was old\n\ngrannyHarrison, and that’s all one. I tell you, aunt Becca, there’s no mistake about his being\n\na whig—why his very looks shows it—every thing about him shows it—if I was deaf and\n\nblind I could tell him by the smell. I seed him when I was down inSpringfieldlast winter. They had a sort of a gatherin there one night, among the grandees,\n\nthey called a fair. All the galls about town was there, and all the handsome widows,\n\nand married women, finickin about, trying to look like galls, tied as tight in the\n\nmiddle, and puffed out at both ends like bundles of fodder that hadn’t been stacked\n\nyet, but wanted stackin pretty bad. And then they had tables all round the house\n\nkivered over with baby caps, and pin-cushions, and ten thousand such little nick-nacks,\n\ntryin to sell ‘em to the fellows that were bowin and scrapin, and kungeerin about\n\n‘em. They wouldn’t let no democrats in, for fear they’d disgust the ladies, or scare\n\nthe little galls, or dirty the floor. I looked in at the window, and there was this\n\nsame fellow Shields floatin about on the air, without heft or earthly substance, just\n\nlike a lock of cat-fur where cats had been fightin. ‘He was paying his money to this one and that one, and tother one, and sufferin great\n\nloss because it wasn’t silver instead of State paper; and the sweet distress he seemed\n\nto be in,—his very features, in the exstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly—‘Dear girls,it is distressing, but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know how much you suffer; but do,doremember, it is not my fault that I amsohandsome andsointeresting.’ ‘As this last was expressed by a most exquisite contortion of his face, he seized\n\nhold of one of their hands and squeezed, and held on to it about a quarter of an hour.\n\nO, my good fellow, says I to myself, if that was one of our democratic galls in the\n\nLost Township, the way you’d get a brass pin let into you, would be about up to the\n\nhead. He a democrat! Fiddle-sticks! I tell you, aunt Becca, he’s a whig, and no mistake:\n\nnobody but a whig could make such a conceity dunce of himself.’ ‘Well, says I, may be he is, but if he is, I’m mistaken the worst sort.’ ‘May be so; may be so; but if I am I’ll suffer by it; I’ll be a democrat if it turns\n\nout that Shields is a whig; considerin you shall be a whig if he turns out a democrat.’ ‘A bargain, by jingoes,’ says he, ‘but how will we find out.’ ‘Why,’ says I, ‘we’ll just write and ax the printer.’ ‘Agreed again,’ says he, ‘and\n\nby thunder if it does turn out that Shields is a democrat, I never will—’ ‘Jefferson,—Jefferson—’ ‘What do you want, Peggy.’ ‘Do get through your everlasting clatter some time, and bring me a gourd of water;\n\nthe child’s been crying for a drink this live-long hour.’ ‘Let it die then, it may as well die for water as to be taxed to death to fattenofficers of State.’ Jeff run off to get the water though, just like he hadn’t been sayin any thing spiteful;\n\nfor he’s a raal good hearted fellow, after all, once you get at the foundation of\n\nhim. I walked into the house, and ‘why Peggy,’ says I, ‘I declare, we like to forgot you\n\naltogether.’ ‘O yes,’ says she, ‘when a body can’t help themselves, every body soon\n\nforgets ‘em; but thank God by day after to-morrow I shall be well enough to milk the\n\ncows and pen the calves, and wring the contrary one’s tails for ‘em, and no thanks\n\nto nobody.’ ‘Geod evening, Peggy,’ says I, and so I sloped, for I she was mad at me, for ing Jeff neglect her so long. And now Mr. Printer, will you be sure to let us know in your next paper whether this\n\nShields is a whig or a democrat? I don’t care about it for myself, for I know well\n\nenough how it is already, but I want to convince Jeff. It may do some good to let\n\nhim, and others like him, knowwhoandwhattheseofficers of Stateare. It may help to send the present hypocritical set to where they belong, and\n\nto fill the places they now disgrace with men who will do more work, for less pay,\n\nand take a fewer airs while they are doing it. It aint sensible to think that the\n\nsame men who get us into trouble will change their course; and yet its pretty plain,\n\nif some change for the better is not made, its not long that neither Peggy, or I,\n\nor any of us, will have a cow left to milk, or a calf’s tail to wring.",

In 1842, the\n                  concept was revived in a series of letters purporting to be from a woman named “Rebecca”\n                  from the Lost Townships. The first, dated August 10, 1842 and published on August\n                  19, bemoaned the failure of theState Bank of  Illinoisand the subsequent depreciation of its printed paper money. On August 26, 1842, the\n                  Democratic administration, including State AuditorJames Shields, decreed that the state would not accept its own money as payment for taxes. A widely\n                  unpopular decision, it was lambasted immediately by Whigs likeAbraham Lincoln, who wrote this pseudonymous editorial as a scathing rebuke of Shields. Shields’\n                  offense and Lincoln’s response to it nearly resulted in a duel between the two men.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 5 May 1838, 2:5; 19 August 1842, 3:1-3; Roy P.

It may do some good to let\n               him, and others like him, knowwhoandwhattheseofficers of Stateare.  It may help to send the present hypocritical set to where they belong, and\n               to fill the places they now disgrace with men who will do more work, for less pay,\n               and take a fewer airs while they are doing it.  It aint sensible to think that the\n               same men who get us into trouble will change their course; and yet its pretty plain,\n               if some change for the better is not made, its not long that neither Peggy, or I,\n               or any of us, will have a cow left to milk, or a calf’s tail to wring."
