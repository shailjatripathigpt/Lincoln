He even allowed himself to become\n                  a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee to supplant Democratic incumbentJames Shieldsas U.S. Senator. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to\n                  political allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to theU.S. Senate.Leonard Swett to Abraham Lincoln;Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 10 November 1854, 2:5; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

On January 14, 1855, Lincolnrepliedto Yates, stating that he had been aware of such a “Bissell movement” for some time,\n                  but did not believe any “sincere” anti-Nebraskans would vote for Bissell. In the same\n                  letter, Lincoln also noted that he was aware of rumors that Illinois Governor Joel\n                  A. Matteson was stealthily “trying his hand” at garnering support for himself as a\n                  candidate for U.S. senator.The Free West(Chicago, IL), 14 December 1854, 2:2-3."

Davis also wrote Lincoln several letters updating him on Swett’s work\n                  on Lincoln’s behalf.The Nineteenth Illinois General Assembly commenced on January 1, 1855.Lincoln, Shields,Lyman Trumbull, and Matteson were the main contenders when the General Assembly met in joint session\n                  on February 8, 1855, to elect Illinois’ next U.S. Senator. Ultimately, Lincoln did\n                  not win; the General Assembly selected Trumbull instead. See the1854 Federal Election. Both John Strunk and Parks cast their votes for Lincoln for six ballots, then Strunk\n                  switched his vote to Matteson. Parks switched his vote to Trumbull on the eighth ballot.\n                  Wheeler voted for Lincoln for eight ballots, then switched his vote to Trumbull. Both\n                  Day and Strawn cast their initial votes for Lincoln, but then each switched to other\n                  candidates—Day voted forMartin P. Sweettwice before switching to Trumbull, and Strawn voted for Trumbull and thenWilliam B. Ogdenbefore switching back to Trumbull. Cook voted for Trumbull in every round. Osgood\n                  voted for Shields for six ballots, then switched his vote to Matteson.No one nominated Bissell, Lockwood, Churchill Coffing, or Owen Lovejoy for the U.S.\n                  Senate seat, and they did not receive any votes in ten rounds of voting.Matthias L. Dunlapnominated Archibald Williams, but Williams only received two votes in rounds two\n                  and three of balloting, and one vote in rounds four, nine, and ten of balloting.Despiterumorsabout pro-Nebraska Democrats conspiring to avert or delay the election, in reality\n                  it was the anti-Nebraska forces that attempted to delay the election after Shields\n                  polled even with Lincoln after the third ballot.Stephen T. Loganmotioned for the adjournment of the joint session, but members refused to adjourn\n                  by a vote of 56 to 42. Of the forty-one legislators who voted for Lincoln on the third\n                  ballot, only one—George F. Foster—voted against adjourning the session.Several days after the election, Lincolnwrotethat “It was Govr Matteson’s manoevering that forced upon me and my friends the necessity of surrendering to Trumbull.” LincolncitedStrunk as an example of someone Matteson successfully manipulated andwrotethat it was on account of such “sub rosa” political manipulations that Matteson’s\n                  defeat “gives me more pleasure than my own gives me pain.” Lincoln made no political\n                  speeches or public statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his\n                  energies in his law practice.Leonard Swett to Abraham Lincoln;Leonard Swett to Abraham Lincoln;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:401-2; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
