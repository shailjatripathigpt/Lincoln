        "text": "5At the time of 1850 census, the total population ofVanderburgh County, Indianawas 11,414 people, of whom 4,482 were born outside of the United States, with 3,075\n                  having been born inGermany.Page is apparently using “old liners” to meanDemocrats. German immigrants who settled in Vanderburgh County in the 1830s and 1840s were\n                  historically supporters of the Democratic Party. Free soil sympathies ran high among\n                  German immigrants, however, especially among German liberals who emigrated as a result\n                  of the German revolutions of 1848-1849. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actin 1854 caused German-Americans who opposed the expansion of slavery to re-evaluate\n                  their political affiliations. The nascent Republican Party, with its free soil position,\n                  appealed to German immigrants and party leaders actively worked to recruit German-American\n                  voters in the 1856 election.In the 1856 presidential election,  DemocratJames Buchananwon 60.8 percent of the vote in Vanderburgh County,American PartycandidateMillard Fillmore27.2 percent, Fremont 12 percent.J.

Hecker\n                  as presidential electors for the state at large for what would ultimately become the\n                  Illinois Republican Party. Hecker was viewed as a boon to the Republican cause during\n                  the 1856 election   due to his appeal among German-American voters, who were familiar\n                  with his political activities in Germany.It is uncertain whether he came to Evansville, but Hecker gave several speeches inSt. ClairandMonroecounties in Illinois on behalf of Fremont and the Republicans from June through August\n                  1856. In the latter month, Hecker’s home burned down while he was away speaking, in\n                  what was suspected to be a deliberate political act. As he was unable to accept the\n                  numerous speaking invitations he received and was hesitant to travel following the\n                  fire,  Hecker penned an  “Address to the German Population of the United States by\n                  Friedrich Hecker” which was published in newspapers and in pamphlet format and expanded\n                  on the themes in his campaign speeches. Lincoln viewed Hecker’s efforts with German-American\n                  voters as indispensable to the Republican cause, and advocated raising funds    to\n                  enable him to return to speaking following the destruction of his house. By October,\n                  1856 Hecker had returned to the campaign trail and  spoke at large rallies inPennsylvaniaandNew York.Ezra M.
