Bell.\n                  James pressed Lincoln in April, May, and June about an appointment.  Morrison apparently\n                  traveled to Washington, DC, to press his claim, before requesting his name be withdrawn\n                  from further consideration.  In June 1849, however, Morrisonwroteagain asking Lincoln for help in getting the surveyor generalship ofCaliforniaor, failing that, a clerk position in Washington.Neither Morrison, James, nor Bell appear in the official registers of the officers\n                  and agents of the federal government for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so apparently they\n                  did not receive appointments.Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849);Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853);Abraham Lincoln to George W.
