        "text": "1Daniel Procter wrote and signed this letter.The actual date of this document is uncertain.  Procter himself did not date the letter.\n                  At the top of the first page appears a notation in pencil: “Feb 12th 1849.” The Library\n                  of Congress uses that as the date.  This notation, however,  is the only indication\n                  that is the date of the letter. Procter’s reference to “a change in the Administration”\n                  and identification of himself and the petition signers as Whigs suggests that it may\n                  have been written sometime betweenZachary Taylor‘selection as presidenton November 7, 1848, and his inauguration on March 5, 1849.  Reference to Abraham\n                  Lincoln’s “district” indicates that Lincoln was still in theHouse of Representativesat the time Procter wrote, adding to a long list of patronage requests Lincoln received\n                  in the aftermath of Taylor’s election. The second session of theThirtieth Congress--Lincoln’s last in the House--ran from December 4, 1848 to March 3, 1849, lending\n                  further credence to the interregnum period between Taylor’s election and inauguration\n                  as the likely time frame for Procter’s letter.U.S. HouseJournal. 1848-49. 30th Cong., 2nd sess., 3, 672; Michael F.
