        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln’s vote was on abillto compensate a resident of Florida $1,000 for a slave that moved with theSeminole Indianswhen they were forced, as part ofIndian Removal,  to migrate west of theMississippi Riverafter the end of theSecond Seminole War.  Sources disagree about the vote on thisbill.  TheCongressional Globerecorded that the House passed the bill on January 6 by a vote of 91 ayes to 89 nays.\n                  The House Journal, however, reported that the House passed the bill, but recorded\n                  a vote of 89 yeas to 91 nays, thus indicating that the House rejected the bill.  On\n                  January 8, the House Journal vote was corrected to 89 yeas and 90 nays.    On January\n                  8, theCongressional Globecorrected itself, reporting that the vote was 89 yeas to 90 nays.  On January 12,\n                  the House reconsidered the vote rejecting thebill, and continued debate on the subject on the 13th.  On January 19, the House agreed\n                  to reconsider by a vote of 98 yeas to 93 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House\n                  then passed the bill by a vote of 101 yeas to 95 nays, with Lincoln again voting nay.\n                  On January 19, the Senate referred thebillto the Committee on Military Affairs.  The Committee on Miliary Affairs reported\n                  back the bill on February 5 with a report, which the Senate ordered printed.  There\n                  is no indication that the Senate took any further action.U.S. HouseJournal. 1849. 30th Cong., 2nd sess., 207-8, 211, 237, 242, 276-78;\n                     U.S. SenateJournal. 1849. 30th Cong., 2nd sess., 138, 183;Cong.
