        "text": "3The Taylor administration offered Lincoln appointment as secretary of the Oregon Territory\n                  less than a month after Taylor appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln a political appointment in the\n                  Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment.Lincoln firstrespondedto Clayton, declining the position and recommending Francis for it instead, on August\n                  21, 1849. He subsequently sent Clayton several more missives on the topic, including\n                  apetitionsigned by other Whigs in Springfield and the surrounding area affirming Francis as\n                  a qualified candidate for the position. In the end, Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton\n                  ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory. Francis’ name does not appear in the official\n                  registers of the officers and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,\n                  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did not receive any other appointment during this\n                  period. The 1861 official register shows Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment either, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.On September 20, 1849, in a final effort to ease any tensions caused by Butterfield’s\n                  appointment, the Taylor administration also offered Lincoln appointment as governor\n                  of the Oregon Territory. After serious consideration of the offer, Lincoln also declined\n                  this position, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Abraham Lincoln to John M.
