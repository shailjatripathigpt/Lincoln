When the menagreedto aseries of seven debates, the newspaper chose Davisson to cover the events. TheTribuneand Davisson provided full coverage, praising Lincoln’s performances. In addition\n                  to editorial support, the paper arranged railcars for Lincoln supporters to attend\n                  the debates from Chicago, including a special round-trip fare  of $4.85 to theFreeportdebate, which more than 1,000 Lincoln supporters purchased.ThePress and Tribunecontinued to support Lincoln following his loss, writing, “We know of no better time\n                  than the present to congratulate\n                  him on the memorable and brilliant canvass that he\n                  has made. He has fully vindicated the partialities of\n                  his friends, and has richly earned, though he has not\n                  achieved, success. He has created for himself a national\n                  reputation that is both envied and deserved; and though\n                  he should hereafter fill no official station, he has done in\n                  the cause of Truth and Justice what will always entitle\n                  him to the gratitude of his party and to the admiration\n                  of all who respect the high moral qualities and the keen,\n                  comprehensive and sound intellectual gifts that he has\n                  displayed.
