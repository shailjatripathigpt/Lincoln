        "text": "2Abraham Lincolnwas the Republican candidate from Illinois for the U.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for the Illinois House of Representatives andIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the former Whig stronghold\n                  of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest. In local\n                  elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but Pro-Douglas Democrats retained\n                  control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Lincoln arrived in Beardstown on the morning of August 12 on a steamboat fromNaples. Greeted by several hundred citizens, Lincoln traveled by carriage to the National Hotel. Lincoln commenced his speech after 2 p.m. He spoke for two hours to an audience\n                  of as many as 3,000, directly addressing a charge againstDouglasthat theKansas-Nebraska Act—passed in 1854 and establishing popular sovereignty as a means of deciding slave\n                  status for southwestern territories—was part of a larger conspiracy to make slavery\n                  perpetual and national.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008),  1:457-61, 476-77, 513-14,\n                     546-47;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:1-6; Allen C.
