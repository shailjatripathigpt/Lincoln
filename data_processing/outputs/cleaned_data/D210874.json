        "text": "2If Lincoln replied to this letter, his response has not been located.Fleming R. Payneof Marshall, Illinois,  alsowroteLincoln in August 1858 asking him to visit Clark County, Illinois. There is no record\n                  of Lincoln replying to Payne’s letter.At the time of Whitlock’s letter, Lincoln was theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. He was running against Democratic incumbentStephen A. Douglas. Because members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time,\n                  both Lincoln and Douglas  canvassed Illinois throughout the summer and fall of 1858,\n                  delivering speeches in support of candidates for the General Assembly in their respective\n                  parties. However, there is no evidence that Lincoln visited Marshall or even Clark\n                  County at all during thecampaign of 1858. He delivered a speech in Paris, Illinois, on September 7 anddebatedDouglas in Charleston, Illinois, on September 18, so it is possible that some of\n                  Clark County’s voters heard Lincoln speak at one of these events.In Illinois’s local elections of 1858, Clark County sentDemocratJoseph P. Updegraffto the Illinois House over Payne, a Republican. In addition, Clark County elected\n                  DemocratJames C. Robinsonover RepublicanRichard J. Oglesbyas a part of Illinois’ Seventh Congressional District. In the end, Republicans won\n                  a majority of all votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control\n                  of the Illinois General Assembly and Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S.\n                  Senate. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 556-57; Allen C.
