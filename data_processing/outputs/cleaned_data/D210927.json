        "text": "3Woodruff is discussing Stephen A. Douglas’s arguments and actions during theLincoln-Douglas Debates. Douglas was running for reelection to theU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Electionas theIllinoisDemocratic Party’s candidate. Lincoln was running against Douglas as the Illinois\n                  Republican Party’s candidate. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.By the time of this letter, Lincoln and Douglas had already debated one another twice—in\n                  Ottawa, Illinois,  on August 21 and inFreeport, Illinois,  on August 27. During the Ottawa debate, Douglas claimed that Lincoln had helped\n                  draft an anti-slavery Republican Party platform at a meeting inSpringfield, Illinois,  in October of 1854. Douglas offered the debate audience quotes from what was actually\n                  a much more radical platform passed at a Republican meeting inAurora, Illinoisthe same year.Lincoln did not catch Douglas’s misrepresentation of the radical Aurora platform for\n                  the more moderate Springfield platform during the Ottawa debate and therefore did\n                  not correct Douglas at the time, aside from noting that he had not helped create the\n                  platform that Douglas read aloud. During later debates, however, he confronted Douglas\n                  on the issue. Douglas eventually claimed that his mistake was an honest one, even\n                  though he made the same misrepresentation in an 1856 speech in the U.S. Senate (whichLyman Trumbulltook him to task for at the time). Douglas elided personal responsibility for these\n                  false claims through the fall of 1858.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:388, 458, 490-92, 503, 507,\n                     513, 531-33; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 216;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 21 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-21, 27 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-27; First Debate with Stephen A.

During the third debate, inJonesboro, Illinois, Lincoln indeed posed another interrogatory to Douglas, but one suggested by Trumbull\n                  rather than any apparently resulting from this letter from Woodruff.First Debate with Stephen A.

At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere critical to the outcome of the race for the U.S. Senate.Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 2 August 1858, 2:1; Allen C.

In Illinois House District Forty-Five, which\n                  included Will, DuPage, Iroquois, and Kankakee counties, three Republicans took their\n                  seats after the election:Hiram Norton,Alonzo W.

Armstrong, who garnered 38.8 percent, andBuchananDemocrat David Le Roy, who received 3.4 percent.In the state elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in\n                  the state. Parks, Norton, Mack, and Hood each cast their ballots for Lincoln for U.S.\n                  senator. But because pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly, Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate.
