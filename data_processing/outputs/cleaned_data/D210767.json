During his Chicago address on July 10, Lincoln\n                  addressed Douglas’ criticism of his main arguments in the House Divided speech, quoting\n                  from the latter for a time.Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois."

        "text": "4Abraham Lincoln’s reply to this letter, if he wrote one, has not been located.Timothy Lincoln was correct in his assertion that the 1858 contest between Douglas\n                  and Abraham Lincoln was not merely a local one. The campaign was covered extensively\n                  in the Illinois press, and—beginning with Abraham Lincoln’s July 10 Chicago speech—the\n                  national press followed the story as well. National attention to the contest increased\n                  with theLincoln-Douglas Debates.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and, in the1858 Federal Election, Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through\n                  his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well\n                  as standing within the national Republican Party.Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:466-556; Allen C.
