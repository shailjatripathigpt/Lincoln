The suit\n                  ofPeople v. Illinois Central RRwas instituted in theIllinois Supreme Courtabout December 1858 and was called in February 1859. At issue was the valuation of\n                  the railroad’s property, with State Auditor Jesse K. Dubois basing the railroad’s\n                  tax burden on a higher valuation than that claimed by the Illinois Central. Lincoln,\n                  who had worked for the railroad since 1853, was retained for the defense along with\n                  John M. Douglass, William K. Parrish, and Isham N. Haynie. The case came to trial\n                  in 1860 and JusticeSidney Breeseultimately ruled in favor of the railroad and declared the 1857 taxes to have been\n                  paid in full. Lincoln was paid $500 for his work.Newspaper Report, Document ID: 131493,People v. Illinois Central RR, Martha L.
