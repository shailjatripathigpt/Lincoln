Loughborough purchased around 3,000 acres in the western portion\n                  ofChampaign County, Illinois. In 1845, Loughborough conveyed the majority of that land to J. Graves of Kentucky\n                  and the remainder to Lawrence Young, but did not record the deeds at the time. In\n                  1873, Young still owned 400 acres in that county, which he directed to be sold in\n                  his will.
