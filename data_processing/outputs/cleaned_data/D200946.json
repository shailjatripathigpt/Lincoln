In 1857, this would have been Monday, March\n                  30.

        "text": "2Trespass on the Case on Promises was virtually synonymous with, and ultimately replaced\n                  by, the common law action of assumpsit. Assumpsit involved a legal action for the\n                  breach of a simple contract (express or implied), which was not under seal and was\n                  used in a wide variety of situations. It was the most commonly used common law action\n                  in antebellum Illinois.Lincoln was instituting this action against the Illinois Central Railroad to collect\n                  the fees the railroad owed him for his work on their behalf in the case ofIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parke. That case had been finally decided in January 1856 in the Illinois Supreme Court,\n                  which upheld the railroad’s charter as constitutional, and affirmed that under the\n                  charter counties could not tax the railroad. Lincoln had presented the railroad’s\n                  attorneys with a bill for his work in July 1856, but as of the time of this action\n                  he was still awaiting payment.“Assumpsit,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

        "text": "3Unlike an action of debt where a plaintiff sought to recover a specific amount owed\n                  by the defendant,  in an action of assumpsit a plaintiff sued to collect damages and\n                  the amount of the debt could be uncertain and determined by the court or the jury.\n                  Thus, Lincoln was able to claim damages and sue for $6,000 rather than sue for just\n                  the $5,000 he claimed the railroad owed him for his legal services.Although Lincoln prepared his case for the spring 1857 term of the McLean County\n                  Circuit Court, the murder case ofPeople v. Wyant, in which he assisted as a prosecutor, subsumed the entire term. His suit  was ultimately\n                  heard at a special term of the McLean County Circuit Court in June 1857, when he was\n                  awarded $5,000 by a jury. This amount was adjusted down to $4,800 in consideration\n                  of a retainer Lincoln had earlier received from the railroad. He received payment\n                  from the railroad in this amount in August 1857.“Assumpsit,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
