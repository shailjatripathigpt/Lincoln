Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. Supporters of each candidate\n                  sent letters of reference and recommendation to both PresidentZachary Taylorand Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. Although theU.S. Department of the Interioroversaw the U.S. General Land Office, President Taylor was ultimately responsible\n                  for appointing the commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office. In the end, the job\n                  went to Butterfield.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair."

In alettertoJohn Addison, Lincoln later wrote that his loyalty to both Taylor and “the greatwhigcause” induced him to remain silent about his suspicions that Thompson’s and Embree’s\n                  letters were purposefully omitted by someone at the Department of the Interior in\n                  order to give Butterfield an advantage over him in the competition for the job. Thompson’s\n                  and Embree’s letters of recommendation have not been located.Eventually, on April 22, 1850, theDemocrat-controlledU.S. House of Representativesformed a committee underWilliam A. Richardsonto investigate Ewing’s role in and handling of patronage appointments as well as\n                  his management of pension payments and Department of the Interior accounts. On June\n                  8, 1850, theNew York Heraldreported that Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office was one patronage appointment that the Richardson Committee was investigating,\n                  particularly with regard to letters missing from the file on Lincoln that was shown\n                  to President Taylor prior to Taylor selecting the final appointee. However, when the\n                  Committee filed its final reports on September 4-7, 1850, it made no finding regarding\n                  Butterfield’s appointment. The Whig-controlledU.S. Senatealso exonerated Ewing of all charges, although suspicions remained in some Whig circles\n                  that Ewing had indeed suppressed letters of recommendation from Lincoln’s  file.Cong.
