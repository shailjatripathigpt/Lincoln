Lincoln et al.In the case, Edward Oldham and Thomas Hemingway, the surviving partners ofOldham, Todd and Company, which had includedRobert S. Todd, father ofMary Lincoln, claimed that the company had hired Lincoln andNinian W. Edwardsto collect some debts for them inIllinois.  Oldham and Hemingway claimed that Lincoln, Edwards, and George B. Kinkead (who\n                  was acting as Lincoln's attorney inLexington, Kentucky) failed to pay them $472.54.  In June 1853, Oldham and Hemingway sued Lincoln and\n                  others in theKentucky Fayette County Circuit Courtin a chancery action to recover the debt.  In February 1854, after depositions Lincoln\n                  took supported his version of events, Oldham and Hemingway dismissed the case.Oldham & Hemingway v. Lincoln et al., Martha L.
