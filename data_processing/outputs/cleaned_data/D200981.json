        "text": "2It is unclear what case Lincoln attended to in Chicago, Illinois beginning December\n                  1, 1857. He was back in Springfield, Illinois at least as early as December 7.Jonathan Haines and Lincoln exchanged at least seven letters related to Haine’s legal\n                  case, which wasHaines v. Rugg. In the fall of 1856, Haines sued George H. Rugg in the U.S. Circuit Court, Northern\n                  District of Illinois for infringing upon his patent on a reaper (a kind of harvesting\n                  machine). Lincoln represented Haines andT. Lyle Dickeyrepresented Rugg. The case ultimately went to trial in March 1858 and lasted just\n                  four days. JudgeThomas Drummondruled for the plaintiff and awarded Haines $2,300 in damages. Rugg appealed this\n                  decision to theU.S. Supreme Courtin the case,Rugg v. Haines. Lincoln represented Haines until he was elected president in the1860 Federal Election.Rugg v. Hainescommenced December 9, 1862. On December 15, 1862, JusticeRoger B. Taneyupheld the lower court’s decision and awarded Haines $2,300 in damages as well as\n                  costs expended in the suit.In 1858, Haines also suedWait Talcott, along with the other surviving representatives ofManny and Company, in a separate case for infringement upon his reaper patent.
