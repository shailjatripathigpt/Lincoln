The protest was against a series of resolutions\n                  adopted by  theGeneral Assemblyagainst theIndependent Treasury System.  In hisinaugural addressof December 7, 1838, GovernorThomas Carlinopined that “the present condition of the currency and the interests of the country\n                  generally seem to require the establishment of an Independent Treasury...” On December\n                  11, the General Assembly adopted aresolutionreferring that part of the address related to currency to the Committee on Finance,\n                  of which Abraham Lincoln was a member.  On December 18, the Committee on Finance issuedmajorityandminorityreports.  The majority report concluded with aresolutionopposing establishment of an Independent Treasury and calling for re-charter of theSecond Bank of the United Statesor charter of a new national bank.  The minority report closed with a resolution\n                  calling on Illinois’s representatives and senators to vote “for any bill having for\n                  its object the disconnection of the Bank and State.”  On January 22, 1839, the House\n                  of Representatives adopted a resolution affirming “That it is not the policy of the\n                  United States to establish an Independent Treasury or a Sub-treasury system,” by a\n                  vote of 46 yeas to 40 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The House also adopted a resolution\n                  instructing the state’s senators and requesting its representatives to vote against\n                  any law or resolution having for its object the creation of an Independent Treasury\n                  in any form by a vote of 46 to 40, with Lincoln voting yea.
