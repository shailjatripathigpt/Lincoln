        "text": "2Since the mid-1830s, Whigs argued that federal officeholders who received their jobs\n                  through loyalty to theDemocratic Partyrather than merit  gave the Democrats  an advantage in elections. This became a common\n                  theme in thepresidential campaign of 1840.  The Whigs had good reasons to fear: the number of federal officeholders had been\n                  greatly expanded by the system to take the 1840 census, and the officeholders did\n                  involve themselves in advancing the Democratic cause. This was particularly true of\n                  postmasters, who distributed copies of theExtra Globe, the official Democratic campaign sheet and, according to some, blocked distribution\n                  of Whig campaign literature. \n                  Gilmore believed that the postmasters in Mercer County were censuring the mails to\n                  benefit the Democrats--a claim he makes explicit in his last paragraph.Major L. Wilson,The Presidency of Martin Van Buren(Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1984), 197; Michael F.
