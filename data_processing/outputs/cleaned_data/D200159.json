        "text": "3Butler had written Lincoln and Baker on January 21 and 22, respectively,  criticizing\n                  them for their position on the division ofSangamon County.  His letters were precipitated by theHouse of Representativespassing abilldividing part of Sangamon County into three counties.  Lincoln and Baker opposed\n                  division of Sangamon County, but as the first session of theEleventh General Assemblyproceeded, some division appeared inevitable.  The general consensus was to divide\n                  the county into four equal counties, substantially decreasing the size of Sangamon\n                  and isolating it in the corner of one of the new counties.  Using his position on\n                  the Committee on Counties, Lincoln hoped to divide the county in such a manner that\n                  Sangamon would not be disadvantaged.  On January 16,  1839, Lincoln introduced a bill\n                  dividing Sangamon into three counties.  The House passed the bill on January 21, creating\n                  the three small counties ofLogan,Dane, andMenard, and leaving Sangamon  relatively large.  Butler accused Lincoln and Baker  of kowtowing\n                  to land speculators.  Lincoln’sresponseto Butler was much more conciliatory than Baker’sresponse.  Butler’s subsequent response to Lincoln has not survived, while a copy of his subsequent\n                  response to Baker, dated January 29, has been preserved.  Butler apologizes, writing\n                  that he had written “under misapprehension,” and that “it was not my intention to\n                  insult you or any of my friends though under the misapprehension I felt myself badly\n                  treated.”  Baker was apparently not satisfied, for on February 28 Butler professed\n                  “I am willing to meet you as we parted at which time I hope for such mutual concessions\n                  as will enable us to remain as we ever have been if you still persist in a different\n                  course I can regret it.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:145-46;Abraham Lincoln to William Butler;Edward D. Baker to William Butler; Roy P. Basler, ed.,The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1:141-42."
