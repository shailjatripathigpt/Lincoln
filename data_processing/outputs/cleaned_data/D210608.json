Lincoln garnered substantial support for nine ballots, but on the tenth\n                  ballot, the General Assembly elected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullto the U.S. Senate.   All the  state senators and representatives referred or alluded\n                  to by Norton  voted for Lincoln in the first round of voting.

Wheelersupported Lincoln for eight ballots, switching to Trumbull on the ninth ballot. OnlyHurlbut Swancontinued to support Lincoln through all of the first nine rounds of voting. For\n                  the tenth vote, Lincoln withdrew and urged his supporters to vote for Trumbull in\n                  order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat.
