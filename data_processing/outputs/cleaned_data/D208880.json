A MEMORIALTO THECONGRESSOF THE UNITED STATES. Your Memorialists, citizens of the valley of theMississippi, would respectfully state to Your Hon. Body; that in consequence of the discoveries\n\nduring the past year of the extraordinary mineral wealth inCalifornia, which, on various occasions, have been communicated to Your Hon. Body; and of their\n\ngreat and increasing extent, as appears from the latest dates which have been received\n\nfrom the scene of the discoveries; not only a large body of citizens of the United\n\nStates from the East, the valley of the Mississippi, and fromOregon, have already emigrated to California; but great additional numbers are expected\n\nto move for that country from the valley of the Mississippi during the ensuing spring\n\nand summer, by the route of the Grand Prairies and theRocky Mountains, carrying with them not alone the goods and property peculiar to emigrating parties,\n\nbut merchandize, and money, to exchange for gold:2 2d. And, in consequence of the extraordinary riches already developed in these mines;\n\ntheir apparent durability; their wide extent of Territory embraced; their great facility\n\nof operation on the surface, by the poorer classes; without the expensive agency\n\nof machinery; for these reasons, Your Memorialists are of opinion, that the emigration\n\nto California will probably increase by this route, from the valley of the Mississippi,\n\nfor years to come; until the production of these mines, already wonderful; shall become\n\nimmense. 3d. Your Memorialists would, accordingly, suggest to Your Hon. Body, the wisdom of\n\nestablishing an early, safe, and regular commercial communication by this route between\n\nCalifornia and the valley of the Mississippi: whereby the great number of citizen\n\nminers; of the poorer classes (who, from the bosom of the nation are destined to employment\n\nin these mines,) may be accommodated with a safe, cheap, and direct transmission of\n\ntheir mineral products to their friends in the older portions of the Union, at stated\n\nperiods; and receive also, merchandize and money in return—at stated periods: and whereby, the riches of the mines, thus\n\ndiverted in a great degree from foreign countries, may be made to flow directly into\n\nthe centre of the Union. 4th. And, Your Memorialists would respectfully state to Your Hon. Body, as the result\n\nof their opinion after a careful examination of the subject; that this safe commercial\n\ncommunication betweenMissouriand California should be speedily established; as a large emigrating party will leave\n\nearly in the ensuing spring for California: that it should be guarded by about 600\n\nto 800 men, one half mounted Riflemen, and the other half Dragoons; that the whole\n\nconvoy force should be divided into four divisions, or reliefs, each of 150 to 200\n\nmen; that two of these divisions should always winter in California, and the other\n\ntwo atFort Leavenworth. 5th. And Your Memorialists would respectfully state, that the season of operation\n\nfor the convoys being the spring and summer; one of the two reliefs stationed in\n\nCalifornia, and one of the two reliefs stationed at Fort Leavenworth, would start\n\nin the spring, simultaneously (about the middle of April) the former, for Missouri,\n\nas the convoy for the mineral products; the latter for California, as the convoy for\n\nthe emigrating party, merchandize, and money. And these, called the spring convoys, arriving at their several places\n\nof destination at Ft. Leavenworth and California about the middle of July, would be immediately relieved\n\nby the summer convoys, there waiting. Which last, starting from Ft. Leavenworth and California simultaneously (about the middle of July) would arrive\n\nat their several places of destination about the 1st Nov.; thus completing the whole trip from Missouri to California and back; and from California\n\nto Missouri and back; in six months: and thus affording to each miner in California\n\na direct and safe transmission of the mineral wealth to the Mississippi valley, twice\n\na year, viz: 1st. by the spring convoy in April; and 2d. by the summer convoy in July;\n\nand securing also, in like manner, corresponding returns twice a year from the valley\n\nof the Mississippi. Wherein Your Hon. Body will perceive, that as each convoy makes\n\nbut half the trip in one year; or is on travel but three months in one year; the\n\nannual duties of the convoys would not only be possible, but easy, and practicable\n\nto the troops; and might, in consequence, be continued even for years, by the same\n\nconvoy force: and when after a few years it became necessary to relieve this force\n\nby replacing another of equal strength; the two regiments of Dragoons and the mounted\n\nRifle regiment now in service would always afford the means of relief without additional\n\nexpense to the Government. 6th. Your Memorialists would, accordingly, respectfully ask Your Hon. Body the early\n\npassage of an appropriation for establishing a fort, or permanent post at some point\n\nin California convenient to the gold region, to serve for the point of departure\n\nof the convoys; for the assembling of the caravans; and for the collection and security\n\nof the mineral wealth, preparatory to its transmission East, under the protection\n\nof the convoys. And, Your Memorialists would further, respectfully state, that\n\nas one of the convoys would always be present at this post during the spring and\n\nsummer; and two of them during the remaining six months of the year; there would,\n\nin consequence, be no additional expense incurred on account of the force necessary\n\nto garrison this fort. 7th. And, in cases of the transmission of gold by the convoys from California, or\n\nin the remission of specie by the same from the Valley of the Mississippi, wherein\n\nno agent or owner be present in charge of the same; cases which, as may appear to\n\nYour Hon. Body, may be of frequent occurrence from the multitude of small miners employed\n\nin these mines; in such, your Memorialists would respectfully suggest, that Your Hon.\n\nBody would cause such Regulations to be established concerning the reception of said\n\ngold and specie, by the Commander of the convoy, or other officer: concerning its\n\nsafe keeping in transit, and at the points of arrival and departure: and concerning\n\nits delivery and charges by the U.S., at the points of arrival of the convoys; as\n\nin your wisdom may appear to suit these new and pressing emergencies of commerce. 8th. Your Memorialists would, in conclusion, beg leave most respectfully to submit\n\nto Your Hon. Body, the great necessity of a speedy and prompt action in the matters\n\nherein, which, we have the honor to submit to Your Hon. Body; in order that, the\n\nnecessary arrangements may be completed by the Executive for the organization and\n\nlocation at Ft. Leavenworth by the 1st April next, of the convoy force destined for this service;\n\nwhich force, of itself, Your Hon. Body will perceive can occasion no additional expense\n\nto the Government; the troops being already in service, partly in this country, partly\n\nin California; and the service (protection against Indians) being in conformity to\n\nthe original object or law of their organization: so that, Your Hon. Body will perceive\n\nthat, there are no existing reasons which might prevent the immediate action of\n\nthe Government as regards the organization and location of the convoy force by the\n\n1st April; and the early publication of the same throughout the valley of the Mississippi\n\nfor the information of the people, preparatory to the departure of a large emigrating\n\nparty in the spring. And Your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. &c.3",
