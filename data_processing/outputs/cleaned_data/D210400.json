On May 5, Constable himselfwroteLincoln to solicit his assistance.  Constable wanted either a diplomatic appointment\n                  toSouth Americaor a judicial appointment in a territorial government. On May 13, Lincoln wrote aletter of introductionon Constable’s behalf to Secretary of StateJohn M. Clayton. Constable’s name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so apparently he did not receive an appointment.Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849);Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853);Justin Harlan to Abraham Lincoln;Edwin B.
