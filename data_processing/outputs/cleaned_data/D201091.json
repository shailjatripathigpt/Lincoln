Since Cunningham lived in Urbana, Illinois,\n                  at the time, it is likely he was secretary of a Republican Party Club there. Members\n                  of the Republican Party had organized clubs to socialize, organize, and provide support\n                  for candidates since the party’s inception. Sometimes the clubs were new, and sometimes\n                  they emerged from existing clubs that were originally organized for theWhig Partyor theAmerican Party. Some of these Republican clubs called themselves Lincoln clubs; others were simply\n                  local Republican Party clubs.J. R. Stewart, ed.,A Standard History of Champaign County Illinois(Chicago: Lewis, 1918), 2:527; Robert F. Engs and Randall M.

At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running as the Illinois\n                  Republican Party’s candidate to replace incumbent Stephen A. Douglas in theU.S. Senate. He and Douglas both canvassed thestatethroughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for\n                  theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the state’s race for the U.S. Senate seat.\n                  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458;William C.
