Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, nor the project editors have discovered the whereabouts of the original letter in\n                  Lincoln’s hand.  In December 1933, Paul W. Gates, a professor of history at Bucknell\n                  University, who was conducting research in the Bureau of Land Management Records on\n                  the Illinois Central Railroad and federal land policy at the time, located this handwritten\n                  transcription of the letter enclosed in a letter fromRichard M. Young, attorney for William J. Black, toJohn Wilson, Justin H. Butterfield’s successor as commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office,\n                  and sent it to the  Abraham Lincoln Association.   In 1953, Basler reported the original\n                  as missing.  Project editors conducted a thorough search for the document in the Records\n                  of the Bureau of Land Management Records at the National Archives and did not locate\n                  it.     In the absence of the original, project editors have adopted the handwritten\n                  letter provided by Gates and used by Basler.Roy P.

        "text": "2After several failed attempts to build a north-south railroad inIllinois, a successful campaign to build such a railroad began in 1850, when theU.S. Congress, at the behest of SenatorStephen A. Douglas, granted the state nearly 2.6 million acres of federal land. The grant included alternate\n                  640-acre sections of public land adjacent to and within six miles of both sides of\n                  the two-hundred-foot-wide right-of-way. The legislation gave theIllinois General Assemblythe right to dispose of the land to help pay for the construction of the railroad.\n                  In February 1851, the General Assembly chartered the Illinois Central Railroad to\n                  sell the land and build the railroad.When Congress enacted or was considering legislation for railroad land grants, it\n                  was the practice of the U.S. General Land Office to withdraw from sale the public\n                  lands within the proposed boundaries of the grant until railroad officials selected\n                  the lands, appraised them, and set up a system for public sale.  The General Land\n                  Office did this to prevent settlers or speculators from anticipating the route and\n                  entering the lands.  Illinois Central officials were deliberate in selecting the lands\n                  and placing them on sale, and many citizens in Illinois had become restive over their\n                  perceived slowness.“An Act Granting the Right of Way, and Making a Grant of Land to the States of Illinois,\n                     Mississippi, and Alabama, in Aid of the Construction of a Railroad from Chicago to\n                     Mobile,” 20 September 1850,Statutes at Large of the United States9 (1862):466-67; “An Act to Incorporate the Illinois Central Railroad Company,” 10\n                     February 1851,Private Laws of Illinois(1851), 61-74; Paul W.
