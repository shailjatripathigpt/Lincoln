Historians, and indeed onlookers at the time,\n                  have disagreed about the underlying cause, but suffice it to say that the breakup\n                  pushed Lincoln into a deep depression. Compounding this, in April, his close friend\n                  Joshua Speed moved home to Louisville, Kentucky, where he soon began courtingFanny Henning, who he married in February 1842. Sometime in 1842, Lincoln and Mary Todd renewed\n                  their courtship. From January 1842 until his own marriage in November 1842, Lincoln\n                  exchanged many letters with Speed mutually consoling and  reassuring each other on\n                  the matter of their respective  romances.SeeAbraham Lincoln to Joshua F.
