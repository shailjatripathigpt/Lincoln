Lincoln\n                  and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  In the election of 1858 Republican Ephraim Gilmore, Jr. won election in the Illinois\n                  House of Representatives race in the Forty-Eighth District, garnering 5,199 votes\n                  and defeating Douglas Democrat John M.
