He and Douglas canvassed thestatethroughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for\n                  theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the U.S. Senate race. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Lincoln’s public speaking appointments were published in local newspapers throughout\n                  Illinois. At the time of this letter, he was scheduled to speak in Greenville, Illinois,\n                  on September 11 and in Edwardsville, Illinois, on September 13 (although theAlton Daily Courierusually misprinted his speech in Edwardsville as scheduled for September 12).Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

TheTribunereported that Douglas received and read a copy of Trumbull’s August 7 speech in Chicago\n                  while in Beardstown and “almost bursted with rage” during his efforts to refute Trumbull’s\n                  charges that he was complicit in the attempt to pass theLecompton Constitution.There is no indication that Lincoln replied to this letter. In fact, the docketing\n                  he wrote on the envelope shown in the third image suggests that he decided not to\n                  reply to Trible.In its September 3 issue, theAlton Daily Courierupdated Lincoln’s scheduled speaking appointments, reporting that he would speak\n                  in Edwardsville on September 11 and in Greenville on September 13. TheDaily Illinois State Journalreported the same dates as of September 4. Lincoln indeed delivered public addresses\n                  in Edwardsville on Saturday, September 11 and in Greenville on Monday, September 13.\n                  An estimated 400 people attended his address in Edwardsville.Ultimately, in Illinois’ local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Although Lincoln’s\n                  attempt to unseat Douglas was  unsuccessful, his involvement in thecampaign—particularly theLincoln-Douglas Debates—lifted him to national prominence.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 16 August 1858, 2:2; 18 August 1858, 2:2;Alton Daily Courier(IL), 3 September 1858, 2:1;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 4 September 1858, 2:1;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 11 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-11; 13 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-13; Report of Speech at Edwardsville, Illinois;Summary of Speech at Greenville, Illinois;The Weekly Madison Press(IL), 15 August 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:556-57; Allen C.
