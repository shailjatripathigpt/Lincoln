Douglas had criticized theLecompton Constitutionand PresidentJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in theDemocratic Party. Among the allegations Douglas made in his speech was that Buchanan Democrats and\n                  Republicans inIllinoiswere working in concert to defeat him in his bid for reelection to the U.S. Senate\n                  in theelection of 1858.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-47;Cong.

        "text": "3An article entitled “The Postmaster General and Senator Douglas,” published in the\n                  June 18, 1858 edition of theWashington Union, responded to Douglas’s speech of June 15. The article dismissed Douglas’s accusations\n                  that the Buchanan administration was purging federal offices in Illinois of Douglas\n                  supporters, and suggested  that any diminished support Douglas observed among Democratic\n                  officeholders  in the state was due to his own actions andanti-Lecomptonstance. The article also repudiated Douglas’s criticism of Illinois special mail\n                  agentCharles Leib, whom Douglas identified in his speech as having been a leader of the Buchanan Democrats\n                  who had held a party convention in Illinois on June 9, 1858, separate from the organizing\n                  efforts of Democrats who supported Douglas. Douglas accused Leib of having been involved\n                  in antislavery agitation inKansas Territory, and theWashington Unionprinted numerous testimonials supporting Leib.The Washington Union(DC),  18 June 1858, 2:2-4."

        "text": "6At the Illinois Republican Convention in Springfield on June 16, 1858,Charles L. Wilsonintroduced a resolution stating: “That Abraham Lincoln is the first and only choice\n                  of the Republicans of Illinois for the United States Senate, as the successor of Stephen\n                  A. Douglas.” The resolution was reportedly “greeted with shouts of applause” and passed\n                  unanimously.In the spring of 1858 John Wentworth had apparently harbored hopes of himself running\n                  to replace Douglas in the U.S. Senate, calculating that continued division in the\n                  Democratic Party could result in Buchanan Democrats forming an anti-Douglas coalition\n                  with Republicans which might support him. The weakness of the Buchanan Democrats at\n                  a convention they held on April 21, 1858  made this possibility seem unlikely, and\n                  Wentworth afterwards endorsed Lincoln in theChicago Democrat. Wilson, who introduced the resolution effectively naming Lincoln as the Republican\n                  Party’s nominee for the U.S. Senate, was one observer who remained suspicious of Wentworth’s\n                  political ambitions.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:5; Don E. Fehrenbacher,Chicago Giant: A Biography of Long John Wentworth(Madison, WI: American History Research Center, 1957), 153-57; Charles L. Wilson to Abraham Lincoln."

Illinois Republicans nominatedJames MillerandNewton Batemanrespectively for these offices at their convention on June 16. Both men won election\n                  in November 1858, with Miller receiving 3,821 more votes than his nearest competitor,\n                  and Bateman garnering a 2,143-vote majority over his closest competitor.At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. The Democrats ultimately retained control\n                  of the Illinois General Assembly in the election of 1858, with a majority of forty\n                  to thirty-five in the Illinois House of Representatives, and of fourteen to eleven\n                  in the Illinois Senate.
