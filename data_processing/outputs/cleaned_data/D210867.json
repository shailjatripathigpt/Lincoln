        "text": "2Lyman Trumbull delivered an address in Chicago, Illinois, on August 7, 1858. In the\n                  speech, he discussed the history of slavery within the United States as well as the\n                  impact of theKansas-Nebraska Actupon the nation. He asserted that Stephen A. Douglas and other members of the Democratic\n                  Party were disingenuous in their claims that their primary political goal was to allow\n                  the nation’s people to decide the slavery issue for themselves. Trumbull cited theLecompton Constitutionand theU.S. Supreme Court’s ruling inScott v. Sandfordas evidence that elements of the Democratic Party were conspiring to nationalize\n                  slavery. The latter was a charge  Lincoln also made, including during his so-called\n                  “House Divided” speech at the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running as the IllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace incumbent Douglas in theU.S. Senate. Throughout the1858 Federal ElectionLincoln, Douglas, and Trumbull each  canvassed thestate, delivering speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore,  the races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the state’s race for the U.S. Senate seat.“Bolters” is what Douglas and his political allies called those members of the Illinois\n                  Democratic Party who favored PresidentJames Buchananand his national Democratic allies’s positions with regard to the Lecompton Constitution\n                  and popular sovereignty. SeeBleeding Kansas. President Buchanan and his political allies, in turn, accused Douglas and his supporters\n                  of being the true “bolters.”Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 11 August 1858, 2:1-3; 12 August 1858, 2:1-3; 13 August 1858, 2:1-3;\n                     Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

        "text": "3Delahay is discussing political patronage appointments after Franklin Pierce won election\n                  as president in thefederal election of 1852. Douglas had promised fellow Illinois Democrats that he would use his influence to\n                  ensure that those who “fight the battles” on behalf of the party received appointments,\n                  but President Pierce prioritized patronage as a tool to ease divisions within the\n                  party. Douglas had less influence with Pierce than he originally assumed, and Pierce\n                  ultimately appointed a mixture of Free Soil Democrats and states’ rights advocates\n                  to both his cabinet and important federal positions throughout the nation—including\n                  in Illinois. Douglas had some success swaying Pierce with regard to lower-level appointments.\n                  For instance, he successfully convinced Pierce to appoint Thomas Hoyne district attorney\n                  for Illinois. This angered many Illinois Democrats since Hoyne had supported Martin\n                  Van Buren under the Free Soil ticket during theelection of 1848. Pierce also awarded Free Soil DemocratRichard S. Molonya patronage position: register of theU.S. General Land OfficeinDanville, Illinois. Douglas faced accusations that, by pushing for and supporting such appointments,\n                  he was rewarding party disloyalty. Samuel S. Hayes, for example, penned an open letter\n                  to the public that was highly critical of Douglas. Like Pierce, Douglas insisted that\n                  his strategy would advance party unity. Pierce and Douglas’ conciliation of the Free\n                  Soilers within the party after the federal election of 1852 led many Democrats to\n                  feel slighted, and major fissures emerged in the party not just in Illinois, but \n                  throughout the nation.Lincoln referenced Molony’s appointment to the Danville land office as a Democrat\n                  during the third iteration of theLincoln-Douglas Debates, claiming that he “never heard anything of Judge Douglas’ instrumentality in this.”\n                  Lincoln also noted, however, that he saw a handbill inFreeport, Illinois, announcing that Molony was to give “a Democratic speech in favor of Judge Douglas”\n                  after the conclusion of the second Lincoln-Douglas Debate, which was held in Freeport.\n                  In his reply to Lincoln during the third debate, Douglas denounced Molony as “no Democrat.”Robert W. Johannsen,Stephen A. Douglas(New York: Oxford University Press, 1973), 375-81, 387-88;Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853), 259;Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1855(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1855), 164;Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 23 April 1853, 2:3-5; 15 September 1854, 2:4; Third Debate with Stephen A.

Toombs introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate aimed at quelling\n                  the escalatingpolitical violence in Kansasby providing a pathway for a state constitutional convention in theKansas Territory. The Senate referred the measure to the Committee on Territories, which Douglas chaired.\n                  When the committee reported on the bill, it no longer included a provision for the\n                  residents of Kansas to vote on any proposed constitution. Trumbull asserted that Douglas\n                  had made the change. In a speech Douglas gave in December 1857, he claimed that both\n                  he and Toombs “modified” the bill in consultation with one another, but stopped short\n                  of admitting that he removed the provision in question.For a time, when speaking on the Toombs bill, Lincoln merely attested to Trumbull’s\n                  honesty on the subject. Later, including during theLincoln-Douglas Debates, he openly charged Douglas with making the change.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:519;Cong.

Sometimes the clubs were new,\n                  and sometimes they emerged from existing clubs that were originally organized for\n                  theWhig Partyor theAmerican Party. Some of these Republican clubs called themselves Lincoln clubs; others were simply\n                  local Republican Party clubs. It was not until the1860 Federal Electionthat members of the Republican Party created successful mass clubs of supporters\n                  in the form of the Wide Awake marching clubs. The Wide-Awakes, as they were known at the time, were locally organized\n                  but highly active in various parts of the nation during the campaign of 1860. Most\n                  members were young men and many were first-time voters. They wore military-style uniforms\n                  complete with black caps and capes, held enthusiastic torchlight political marches\n                  and parades at night, and played a significant role in Lincoln’s election as president.For an example of a Lincoln club that was active during the campaign of 1858, see\n                  theLincoln Republican Club of McLean County.Robert F.

        "text": "11The phrase “played out” is thought to have originated in the Americas around 1856.\n                  It means out of date or fashion, exhausted from overuse.In the summer of 1854, at Douglas’ urging, President Pierce appointed John Calhoun\n                  surveyor general of the Kansas and Nebraska territories. Calhoun was a strong supporter\n                  of Douglas and updated him regularly on political conditions in the Kansas Territory.\n                  Through this connection, Douglas was able to exert some influence over political developments\n                  in the territory. He had hoped to use political patronage as a way to bolster the\n                  Democratic Party’s presence there. Together, he and Calhoun tried to unite pro-slavery\n                  Democrats in the territory with states’ rights Whigs and free-state Democrats. This\n                  task proved very challenging, however, and many free-state Democrats in the territory\n                  eventually drifted into the Republican Party. Calhoun became deeply entangled in the\n                  controversy over the Lecompton Constitution, and was  implicated in and condemned\n                  for the election fraud that took place in December 1857 and January 1858. Facing widespread\n                  accusations of misconduct and intense scrutiny, he eventually fled to the Nebraska\n                  Territory. President Buchanan removed Calhoun as surveyor general of the Kansas and\n                  Nebraska territories in the summer of 1858.For additional information on the progression and conclusion of political conflict\n                  in the Kansas Territory, seeBleeding Kansas.“Played out,”Merriam-Webster.com, Merriam-Webster, 19 May 2025,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/played%20out#h1; Ebenezer C.

but he being then asusuala Presidential aspirant prefered to pitch in for his friends for office from other states, with a view to secure friends\n               out side of Illinois, regarding Illinois as sure for him under any and all circumstances &\n               neglected his friends at home; this became notorious so much so that Hays &  others\n               made a demonstration towards getting up a rebellion and even did go so far as to demonstrate\n               some hostility,  the Defection included<Page 2>Col[Colonel]Dick Taylor& many others;
