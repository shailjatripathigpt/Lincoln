        "text": "2The letter from Joseph Gillespie that Lincoln references has not been located. However,\n                  it was most likely a response to aletterLincoln wrote Gillespie requesting a letter of recommendation in support of his candidacy\n                  for commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Originally, only Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, and Cyrus Edwards were vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition\n                  after learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. Supporters\n                  of each candidate sent letters of reference and recommendation to both President Zachary\n                  Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. Although theU.S. Department of the Interioroversaw the U.S. General Land Office, President Taylor was ultimately responsible\n                  for appointing the commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office. In the end, the job\n                  went to Butterfield.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Lincoln received Gillespie’s letter in Washington, DC, because, as competition for\n                  the job  intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in DC, had urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s capital\n                  to personally lobby for the position. Lincoln arrived on or before June 19, 1849.William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;Josiah M.
