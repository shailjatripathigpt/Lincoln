Oglesby assigned the notes to W. & C. Fellows. After Kellar and Snyder failed to pay, W. & C. Fellows retained Stuart & Lincoln\n                  in October 1838, and sued in the Macon County Circuit Court to collect the debt, plus\n                  $100 in damages. The parties reached a settlement in March 1839, and the court dismissed\n                  the case. In addition to the $12.50 mentioned in this document, Kellar also assigned\n                  to Abraham Lincoln a debt, amount unspecified, owed to him by John Johnson.W. & C. Fellows v.
