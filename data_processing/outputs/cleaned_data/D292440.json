        "text": "2Archer’s case in the U.S. House of Representatives concerned his contested election\n                  for a seat in that body.In the1854 Federal Election,RepublicanArcher lost the race in Illinois’ Seventh Congressional District toDemocratJames C. Allenby a single vote, garnering 8,451 votes to Allen’s 8,452. Allen received the certificate\n                  of election and presented his credentials, but Archer contested the outcome and submitted\n                  a petition to the House in February 1856. The House then referred the issue to its\n                  Committee on Elections, which investigated the matter throughout the spring of 1856\n                  and issued a majority report and resolutions in May affirming that Archer, not Allen,\n                  was the rightful winner of the election. The House took up discussion of the report\n                  and resolutions from July 16 to 18, with Archer giving a speech on July 18 explaining\n                  that he believed that several ballots in the Livingston precinct ofClark Countyhad been improperly counted, resulting in Allen’s single-vote majority. On July 18,\n                  the House adopted a resolution affirming that Allen had not won the election and was\n                  not entitled to the seat but rejected a resolution affirming that Archer had won the\n                  election and was entitled to the seat. At an impasse, the House nullified the results\n                  and left the seat vacant until a new election could be held. In August 1856, Allen\n                  defeated Archer in a special election and filled the seat from November 1856 through\n                  March 1857.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.
