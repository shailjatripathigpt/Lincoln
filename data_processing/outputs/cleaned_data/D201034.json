Scripps mentioned in hisletterto Lincoln of June 22 that some of hisKentuckyfriends took issue with Lincoln's now-famous comment, \"I believe this Government\n                  cannot endure, permanently, halfslaveand halffree. I do not expect the Union to bedissolved— I don't expect the house tofall— but Idoexpect it will cease to be divided. It will becomeallone thing, orallthe other. Either theopponentsof slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind\n                  shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction; or itsadvocateswill push it forward till it shall become alike lawful inallthe States,oldas well asnew—Northas well asSouth\" They believed that Lincoln's words foretold a war on slavery by theRepublican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-65;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:5, 6; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois;  Fragment of A House Divided: Speech at Springfield, Illinois;  Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois."

        "text": "3Delegates to the Illinois Republican State Convention had nominated Lincoln as Republican\n                  candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.Lincoln continued to  articulate this position on slavery in the South throughout\n                  his electoral campaign and in a series ofdebateswithStephen A. Douglas, theDemocratic Partycandidate and incumbent. In an account of the  first debate on August 21, 1858, Lincoln said, \"I will say here, while upon\n                  this subject, that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the\n                  institution of slavery in the States where it exists.\" In an account of the third debate on September 15, 1858, Lincoln stated, \"I hold myself under constitutional\n                  obligations to allow the people in all the States without interference, direct or\n                  indirect,to doexactly as they please, and I deny that I have any inclination to interfere with\n                  them, even if there were no such constitutional obligation.\" He made similar arguments\n                  in the fifth, sixth, and seventh debates.  Lincoln would lose to Douglas, but the\n                  senatorial campaign and debates brought Lincoln national recognition and increased\n                  standing within the Republican Party.
