Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner.  Abraham Lincoln entered the competition after\n                  learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.Thomas addresses  Lincoln at Washington, DC, because, as competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19.Jesse K. Duboismade Lincoln aware of Thomas’ efforts on his behalf in aletterdated June 11.  Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment;\n                  the job went to Butterfield instead.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair.William H.
