        "text": "3Lincoln’s telegram has not been located. William Martin’s response to this letter,\n                  if he wrote one, has not been located.Lincoln was collecting evidence for lawsuits on behalf of theAlton and Sangamon Railroad Company, which had retained Martin andLincoln & Herndonto collect balances due on shares of capital stock purchased by stockholders.TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in February 1847 to construct and operate a railroad between\n                  Alton, Illinois, viaNew Berlin, and Springfield, Illinois.  Section two  of the company’s charter allowed the incorporators\n                  to issue $500,000 in stock at $100 per share, and section six required subscribers\n                  to purchase stock by paying $5 on each share subscribed at the time of subscribing\n                  and the balance in installments called for by a board of directors. The incorporators\n                  opened subscription for stock in May 1847.  Many stock subscribers owned property\n                  near the proposed route. On January 29, 1851, however, the General Assembly altered\n                  the charter to allow the company to construct the road on a more direct route, bypassing\n                  the property of several stockholders.  Believing that the change in route voided their\n                  subscription agreements, many  investors refused to pay their remaining installments,\n                  and the company  hired Lincoln & Herndon to collect the full subscriptions.  Several\n                  of the delinquent subscribers were fromSangamon County, Illinois, and thirty-seven were fromMadison County, Illinois.  The railroad hired Martin to collect the full subscriptions in Madison County and\n                  Lincoln & Herndon to  collect in Sangamon County.  In addition to being an attorney\n                  for the railroad, Martin was also one of the original incorporators.Lincoln planned to bring suit on behalf of the railroad against Sangamon County residentsJames A. Barret,Joseph Klein, Sr.,John M. Burkhardt, andThomas J.  Kirkpatrick.  Burkhardt and Kirkpatrick paid their installments, and the railroad dismissed their\n                  cases against them.  Lincoln continued to pursue cases against Barret and Klein.The “New York depositions” came fromIsaac Gibson, secretary of the railroad.   Lincoln hoped to depose Gibson in the Barret and Klein\n                  lawsuits.  On February 26, 1851, LincolnwroteGibson, requesting that he bring the books of the corporation  and appear before\n                  theSangamon County Circuit Courtat the opening of its spring session on March 17.  Gibson responded to this letter\n                  on March 15 with atelegramand aletter, relating that it would be impossible for him to appear before the court in March\n                  1851, forcing Lincoln to postpone the suits against Barret and Klein until the August\n                  term. Gibson gave his deposition in August 1851 inNew York City.Lincoln was particularly keen to obtain evidence that the railroad had given proper\n                  notice in calling for stockholders to pay their installments.  Section fourteen of\n                  the railroad’s charter required the directors to give notice of the payments required\n                  at least ninety days prior to date of payment, in newspapers in the locations where\n                  notice for opening the books for subscriptions had been published.St. Louis, Springfield, and Alton were the cities where the incorporators published notices\n                  for subscriptions.  The case files include handwritten transcriptions of calls for\n                  installments from theAlton Telegraph & Democratic Reviewand theIllinois Journal, but this did not satisfy Lincoln; he was eager to find proof of the railroad’s calls\n                  in the newspapers themselves, particularly Springfield’s papers, and in aletterto Martin dated August 29, he expressed frustration with this effort.In addition to this letter and the aforementionedletterof August 29, Lincoln wrote Martin nine other letters on these cases.“An Act to Construct a Railroad from Alton, in Madison County, to Springfield, in\n                     Sangamon County,\" 27 February 1847,Private and Special Laws of Illinois(1847), 144-49;Alton & Sangamon Railroad Stock Subscription Book; “An Act to Amend the Charter of the Alton and Sangamon Railroad Company,” 27 January\n                     1851,Private Laws of Illinois(1851), 35; Declaration, Praecipe, Document ID: 4786;  Order, Document ID: 5224,Alton & Sangamon RR v.
