Thomas L. Harris was challenging Yates, the incumbent, for the seat\n                  representing the Sixth Illinois Congressional District.In a letter of August 28, 1854 to Harris printed in theIllinois Daily Journal, Yates wrote that Harris’ notification of his plan to begin the congressional campaign\n                  with a speech in Carrollton had arrived too late for Yates to attend. As Lincoln was\n                  at that moment with Yates inJacksonvillefollowing a speech of his own inWinchester, Yates proposed to send Lincoln to speak in his place, with the intention that Lincoln\n                  would speak on the Kansas-Nebraska Act and not defend or attack either candidate.\n                  Lincoln had returned to Springfield by August 30.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.
