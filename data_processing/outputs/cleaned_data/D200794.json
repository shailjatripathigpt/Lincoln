Harris printed in theIllinois Daily Journal, Yates wrote that Harris’ notification of his plan to begin the congressional campaign\n                  with a speech in Carrollton had arrived too late for Yates to attend. As Lincoln was\n                  at that moment with Yates inJacksonvillefollowing a speech of his own inWinchester, Yates proposed to send Lincoln to speak in his place, with the intention that Lincoln\n                  would speak on the Kansas-Nebraska Act and not defend or attack either candidate.\n                  Lincoln had returned to Springfield by August 30. In thegeneral electionheld in November 1854, Harris defeated Yates by 200 votes, garnering 50.5 percent\n                  of the vote to Yates’ 49.5 percent.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.
