Ebenezer Peck was present at this speech.\n                  Princeton was the hometown ofOwen Lovejoy, whom theRepublican Partynominated overLeonard Swettas its candidate for U.S. representative inIllinois’ Third Congressional District. As hewrotein a July 7 letter toDavid Davis, upon learning of Lovejoy’s nomination while en route to Princeton, Lincoln was so\n                  upset that he almost turned back for home.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 11 July 1856, 2:1; Howard W.

        "text": "4Judd and Peck are urging Lincoln to come to Iowa as part of Lincoln’s speaking tour\n                  on behalf of Republican candidates during the1856 Federal Electioncampaign.  No reply from Lincoln to either Judd or Peck has been located. However,\n                  in a July 12replyto James W. Grimes, Lincoln mentions receiving this July 7 letter from Judd and Peck\n                  and outlines the reasons that he believed he should not travel to Iowa to stump on\n                  behalf of the Republican candidates. In the end, although Lincoln stumped extensively\n                  throughout Illinois in July and August, he did not speak in Iowa. Lincoln did, however,\n                  deliver one speech beyond Illinois’ borders that year—inKalamazoo, Michiganon August 27, at the invitation ofHezekiah G. Wells. Orville H. Browning gave speeches at a Republican meeting inKeokuk, Iowa, on July 31 and August 1, 1856, and appeared in Burlington, Iowa on August 2, 1856,\n                  but was so hoarse from the previous two days of speaking thatJohn Wentworthgave a speech in his place.In Iowa’s state general election of August 4, both men that voters elected to the\n                  U.S. Congress were Republicans, and the Republican Party gained control of theIowa General Assemblyas well as all departments of the state government that were up for election.In the end, theDemocratic Partytriumphed in the 1856 presidential race:James Buchananwon the presidency. In Illinois, Buchanan won 44.1 percent of the vote to RepublicanJohn C. Fremont’s 40.2 percent and American Party candidateMillard Fillmore’s 15.7 percent. Iowa, however, cast its electoral ballots for Fremont and his running\n                  mate,William L. Dayton. InDes Moines County, Iowa—in which Burlington was located—the race was close. Buchanan won 1,413 votes to Fremont’s\n                  1,338, and Fillmore garnered just 522 votes. Other southern counties in Iowa west\n                  of Burlington reflected a similar pattern. Voters in Van Buren County, Iowa, for instance,\n                  awarded Buchanan 1,396 votes, Fremont 1,093 votes, and Fillmore 303 votes. Voters\n                  in Monroe County, Iowa cast a comparable proportion: 622 ballots for Fremont, compared\n                  to 603 for Buchanan, and 98 for Fillmore.In the contest for Illinois’ Third Congressional District’s seat in theU.S. House of Representatives, Lovejoy defeated his Democratic opponent,Uri Osgood, with 59.4 percent of the vote to Osgood’s 40.5 percent.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:426-28;Abraham Lincoln to Hezekiah G.
