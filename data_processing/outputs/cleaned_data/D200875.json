Lincoln received Powell’s letter by January 29, 1856 when he wrote\n                  and filed a praecipe in Sangamon County Circuit Court in the case ofAspinall v. Lewis, Johnson & Co.Powell had forwarded toLincoln & Herndona promissory note that plaintiff Thomas Aspinall was attempting to recover from the\n                  Springfield firm ofLewis, Johnson & Company.In 1848, Isaac V. W. Dutcher and Charles K. Bacon had purchased an interest in the\n                  patent rights to a churn from Lewis, Johnson & Co., which they partially paid via\n                  promissory note. That note was later conveyed by Lewis, Johnson & Co. to Aspinall,\n                  who instituted a suit against Dutcher and Bacon in the St. Louis Court of Common Pleas\n                  to recover the value of the note. Aspinall lost that case  in an 1852 judgment that\n                  declared the note was worthless because the churn had failed. Thus, Aspinall turned\n                  to pursuing Lewis, Johnson & Co. for the debt with the assistance of Lincoln & Herndon.\n                  On May 8, 1857, the Sangamon County Circuit Court dismissed the case at the request\n                  of Aspinall’s attorney, presumably William H. Herndon as Lincoln was inDanvilleon that date.  Aspinall was apparently unaware that the case was dismissed,  as he\n                  wrote to Lincoln & Herndon on April 26, 1859 requesting to know what if anything they had\n                  done in the case.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 29 January 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-01-29; 8 May 1857,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1857-05-08;Aspinall v.
