Lincoln et al.In the case, Edward Oldham and Thomas Hemingway, the surviving partners of Oldham,\n                  Todd and Company, which had included Robert S. Todd, father ofMary Lincoln, claimed that the company had hired Lincoln and Edwards to collect some debts for\n                  them in Illinois.  Oldham and Hemingway claimed that Lincoln, Edwards, andGeorge B. Kinkead(who was acting as Lincoln's attorney in Lexington, Kentucky) failed to pay them\n                  $472.54. In June 1853, Oldham and Hemingway sued Lincoln and others in a chancery\n                  action in Kentucky’s Fayette County Circuit Court to recover the debt. Lincoln denied\n                  the charges and claimed that his father-in-law, Todd, had asked him to collect two\n                  debts in Illinois and told Lincoln that he could keep the proceeds.  Lincoln collected\n                  $50 from one of the debts and none from the other.Oldham & Hemingway v. Lincoln et al., Martha L.
