    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to Eliza Browning, 1 April 18381 Without appologising for being egotistical, I shall make the history of so much of my own life, as has\n\nlapsed since I saw you, the subject of this letter— And by the way I now discover,\n\nthat, in order to give a full and inteligible account of the things I have done and sufferedsinceI saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happenedbefore— It was, then, in the autumn of 1836, that amarried ladyof my acquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine,whobeing about to pay a visit to herfatherand other relatives residing inKentucky, proposed to me, that on her return she would bring asisterof hers with her, upon condition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law\n\nwith all convenient dispach— I, of course, accepted the proposal; for you know I could not have done otherwise,\n\nhad I really been averse to it; but privately between you and me, I was most confoundedly\n\nwell pleased with the project— I had seen the saidsistersome three years before, thought her inteligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding life through hand in hand with\n\nher— Time passed on, theladytook her journey, and in due time returned,sisterin company sure enough— This stomached me a little; for it appeared to me, that her\n\ncoming so readily showed that she was a trifle too willing; but on reflection it occured to me, that she might have been prevailed on by hermarried sisterto come, without any thing concerning me ever<Page 2>having been mentioned to her; and so I concluded that if no other objection presented\n\nitself, I would consent to wave this— All this occurred upon myhearingof her arrival in the neighbourhood; for, be it remembered, I had not yetseenher, except about three years previous, as before mentioned— In a few days we had an interview, and although I had seen her before, she did^not^look as my immagination had pictured her— I knew she was over-size, but she now appeared a fair match for\n\nFalstaff;2I knew she was called an \"old maid\", and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least\n\nhalf of the appelation; but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid thinking of mymother; and this, not from withered features, for her skin was too full of fat, to permit\n\nits contracting in to wrinkles; but from her want of teeth,andweather-beaten appearance in general, and from a kind of notion that ran in my head,\n\nthatnothingcould have commenced at the size of infancy, and reached her present bulk in less\n\nthan thirtyfive or forty years; and, in short, I was not all pleased with her— But what could I do?\n\nI have told hersisterthat I would take her for better or for worse; and I made a point of honor and conscience\n\nin all things, to stick to my word, especially if others had been induced to act on\n\nit, which in this case, I doubted not they had, for I was now fairly convinced, that\n\nno other man on earth would have her, and hence the conclusion that they were bent\n\non holding me to my bargain— Well, thought I, I<Page 3>have said it, and, be consequences what they may, it shall not be my fault if I fail\n\nto do it— At once I determined to consider her my wife; and this done, all my powers\n\nof discovery were put to the rack, in search of perfections^in her,^which might be fairly set-off,to^against^her defects— I tried to immagine she was handsome, which, but for her unfortunate corpulency, was actually true— Exclusive\n\nof this, no woman that I have seen, has a finer face— I also tried to convince myself,\n\nthat the mind was much more to be valued than the person; and in this, she was not\n\ninferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had been acquainted— Shortly after this, without attempting to come to any positive understanding with\n\nher, I set out forVandalia, when and where you first saw me— During my stay there, I had letters from her, which\n\ndid not change my opinion of either her intelect or intention; but on the contrary, confirmed it in both— All this while, although\n\nI was fixed \"firm as the surge repelling rock\" in my resolution, I found I was continually\n\nrepenting the rashness, which had led me to make it— Through life I have been in no\n\nbondage, either real or immaginary from the thraldom of which I so much desired to be free— After my return home, I saw nothing to change my opinion of her in any particular—\n\nShe was the same and so was I— I now spent my time^between^ planing how I might get along through lifewhenafter my contemplated change of circumstances should have taken place; and how I\n\nmight procrastinate the evil day for a time, which I really dreaded as much—perhaps more, than an irishman does the halter—<Page 4>After all my suffering upon this deeply interesting subject, here I am, wholly unexpectedly,\n\ncompletely out of the \"scrape\"; and I^now^want to know, if you can guess how I got out of it— Out clear in every sense of the^term^; no violation of word, honor or conscience— I don't believe you can guess, and so\n\nI may as well tell you at once. As the lawyers say, it was done in the manner following,\n\ntowit— After I had delayed the matter as long as I thought I could in honor do, which by\n\nthe way^had^brought me round into the last fall, I concluded I might as well bring it to a consummation\n\nwithout further delay; and so I mustered my resolution, and made the proposal to her\n\ndirect; but, shocking to relate, she answered, No— At first I supposed she did it\n\nthrough an affectation of modesty, which I thought but ill-become her, under the peculiar\n\ncircumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the charge, I found she repeled it with greater firmness than before— I tried it again and again, but with the same\n\nsuccess, or rather with the same want of success— I finally was forced to give it\n\nup, at which I verry unexpectedly found myself mortified almost beyond endurance— I was mortified, it\n\nseemed to me, in a hundred different ways—I then for the first time beganMy vanity was deeply wounded by the reflection, that I had so long been too stupid\n\nto discover her intentions, and at the same time never doubting that I understood\n\nthem perfectly; and also, that she whom I had taught my-<Page 5>self to believe no body else would have, had actually rejected me with all my fancied\n\ngreatness; and to cap the whole, I then, for the first time, began to suspect that\n\nI was^really^a little in love with her— But let it all go— I'll try and outlive it— Others have\n\nbeen made fools of by the girls; but this can never be with truth said of me— I most\n\nemphatically, in this instance, made a fool of myself— I have now come to the conclusion\n\nnever^again^to think of marrying; and for this reason; I can never be satisfied with any one\n\nwho would be block-head enough to have me— When you receive this, write me a long yarn about something to amuse me— Give my respects\n\ntoMrBrowning—3.",
