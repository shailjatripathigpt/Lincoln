Jankiewicz, Abraham Lincoln,\n                  and Norman H. Purple.David Spearhad given Henry a promissory note for $262.50, but failed to pay it. Henry assigned\n                  the note to Stephen T. Logan and then retainedLogan & Lincolnto sue Spear to recover the debt. A jury found for Henry and awarded him $286.68.\n                  The attorney general of Illinois then sued for an injunction to stop the execution\n                  of the judgment, claiming that Henry had received the promissory note on behalf of\n                  the State of Illinois in his capacity as a state employee, and that therefore the\n                  State was the proper owner of the note. The parties agreed to arbitration, and Lincoln\n                  was appointed one of the arbitrators.Henry for use of Logan v. Spear, Martha L.
