The split occurred after Douglas, in December\n                  1857,  spoke out against theLecompton Constitutionand criticized President Buchanan for supporting it.

The district leaned Republican.At the time,  members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in theU.S. Senate; therefore, the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to Lincoln's campaign and the outcome of the state’s U.S. Senate\n                  race.  In the state elections of 1858, voters in Henderson and Warren counties electedWilliam C. Rice, a Republican, to the Illinois House.  Rice voted for Lincoln in the election for\n                  U.S. SenateOn October 9, 1858, Lincoln visited the home of  Stephen S.
