In aletterto Marshall dated April 23, 1858, Lincoln asked Marshall,George W. Rives, andOliver L.  Davisto collaborate to find a candidate to run for the Illinois Senate in the Eighteenth\n                  District. Lincoln was looking for supporters to assist him in his candidacy for theU.S. SenateagainstStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. At the time, state legislatures chose members of the U.S. Senate;\n                  therefore, the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand Illinois Senate were important for Lincoln's candidacy.   In the end, Marshall\n                  became the candidate and won the seat.  Democrats retained a majority in both chambers,\n                  however, allowing Douglas to win reelection to the U.S. SenateJohn Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac, 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 219; Allen C.
