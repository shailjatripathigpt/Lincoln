        "text": "3From 1839 onward, Lincoln practiced law inIllinois’Eighth Judicial Circuit, which initially comprised an area larger than the state ofRhode Islandbut shifted in size over time in tandem with population growth. Although Lincoln\n                  rode the entire circuit, he concentrated his practice inSangamon,Tazewell,Logan, andMcLeancounties. In February 1857, however, theIllinois General Assemblyreorganized the Eighth Judicial Circuit, moved Sangamon County into the newly-createdEighteenth Judicial Circuit, and moved Tazewell County into the newly-created Twenty-First Judicial Circuit.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:322; Narrative Overview,\n                     Martha L.
