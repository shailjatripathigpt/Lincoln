        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Roswell E. Goodell has not been located, but it was likely\n                  similar to others he wrote around that time requesting his allies’ help in canvassing\n                  theirIllinois General Assemblymembers for support of his potential candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to his political\n                  allies seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. The\n                  previous year, on November 1, 1853, Goodell had married Mary Jane Matteson, daughter\n                  of GovernorJoel A. Matteson. Although Lincoln would not have known it at the time he wrote the letter, Goodell’s\n                  father-in-law had entered the Senate race and would vie for the same seat as Lincoln.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.
