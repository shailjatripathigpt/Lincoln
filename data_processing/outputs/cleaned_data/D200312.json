        "text": "1This document was written by  Abraham Lincoln. Although theSangamon County Circuit Courtclerk certified the document on September 9, 1842, it is unknown when Lincoln prepared\n                  it. It was written on two sheets of paper that were then affixed together at the top\n                  with wax and a ribbon. In theThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Roy P. Basler asserted that the document was prepared in September 1842 as part\n                  of Lincoln’s courtship ofMary Todd. However, there is no evidence to prove that; and in fact, recent scholars have questioned\n                  whether the two were courting at that point. If Lincoln prepared this in 1842, it\n                  is curious that he omitted the results of the 1838 election, in which he earned more\n                  votes than any other candidate in Sangamon  County, and the1840 election, in which Sangamon County elected a straight Whig ticket, including Lincoln, to the\n                  legislature.Roy P. Basler, ed.,Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1:297-99; Douglas L.

From  1832 to 1836,  Whig and Democrat party\n                  identity became stronger and national issues and policies increased in importance\n                  in state politics and elections. The process was gradual, and although Lincoln here\n                  ascribed either “Whig” or “Democrat” to each candidate, the actual political affiliation\n                  of many of them at the time was more complicated.Theodore Calvin Pease,The Frontier State, 1818-1848, vol. 2 ofThe Sesquicentennial History of Illinois(Springfield: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1918), 136, 140-43; Theodore C.
