On that\n                  date, Lincoln alsowroteto anotherTazewell Countyally,Lyman Porter, soliciting his political support and asking that Porter consult with friends in\n                  regards to theIllinois House of Representativesrace in that county. Lincoln also apparently wrote toJohn A. Jonesof Tazewell County on August 2 with a similar request for support during theelection of 1858Lincoln had been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for the Illinois House of Representatives andIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the former Whig stronghold of central Illinois, where the state\n                  legislative races were the closest.Abraham Lincoln to Lyman Porter;John A.

Roberts ultimately supported Douglas’ candidacy,  and gave a speech in his\n                  favor in Pekin on August 27. Pickett himself spoke in response to Roberts on September\n                  1. Pickett alleged in his speech that although Roberts had addressed his speech to\n                  the Old Line Whigs of Tazewell County and proclaimed himself to still be aHenry ClayWhig, his support of Douglas and of the extension of slavery to the territories conflicted\n                  with Whig ideologies. According to Pickett, Roberts had attempted to paint Lincoln’s\n                  supporters asabolitionistsand advocates of racial equality.In the biblical book of Hosea, the prophet of the same name describes the failures\n                  of the Israelites to live up to their covenant with God, with Ephraim committing the\n                  sin of being joined to idols.Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 4 September 1858, 2:3;Speech of Thos.

Newspaper reports correctly assumed that incumbent Republican\n                  William Kellogg would receive the nomination in Peoria. Kellogg went on to win the\n                  race, garnering 52.8 percent of the vote, while his Democratic opponentJames W. Davidsonreceived 45.7 percent. Tazewell County, however, was one of the counties in the Fourth\n                  District where Kellogg failed to earn a majority of the votes cast, receiving only\n                  47.5 percent of the votes there, compared to Davidson’s 52.2 percent.Kellogg and Davidson had also been the candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives\n                  in the Fourth Congressional District in the1856 election. During that campaign, Kellogg gave speeches in support of his own candidacy and\n                  that of Republican presidential candidateJohn C. Fremont. Newspaper coverage of Kellogg’s 1856 nomination described the convention that nominated\n                  him as a meeting of the opponents of the extension of slavery into the territories.\n                  A later report on speeches by the candidates suggested that the subject of the extension\n                  of slavery to the territories was a key issue in that campaign.Alton Daily Courier(IL), 2 August 1858, 2:2;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 21 August 1858, 2:5; Howard W.
