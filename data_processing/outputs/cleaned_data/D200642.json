        "text": "2Lincoln is referencing a lawsuit involving William Fithian, William Blanchard,  and\n                  Mordecai Mobley.  Mobley gave Blanchard a promissory note for $1,000 and secured the\n                  note with a mortgage on five lots in Springfield, Illinois, and two hundred acres\n                  in Menard County, Illinois.  Blanchard assigned the notes and mortgage to Fithian.\n                  Mobley gave Fithian three promissory notes totaling $1,590 and secured the notes with\n                  a mortgage on the same property.  After Mobley failed to pay, Fithian retainedLincoln & Herndonand sued Mordecai Mobley,Martha Mobley, and Blanchard in an action of foreclosure in theSangamon County Circuit Courtto foreclose the mortgage.  Fithian dismissed the case concerning Blanchard.  Fithian\n                  and Mobley agreed on a judgment against Mobley for $1,080 on the Blanchard mortgage\n                  without redemption and $2,095.20 on the Fithian mortgage with redemption.  The court\n                  sold all of the land for a total of $2,423.  Fithian accepted two drafts totaling\n                  $949.34 as satisfaction of the judgment on the condition that Mobley would pay both\n                  drafts at maturity.Lincoln first discussed this lawsuit in aletterto Fithian dated September 14, 1849.For the documents related to this case, seeFithian v.
