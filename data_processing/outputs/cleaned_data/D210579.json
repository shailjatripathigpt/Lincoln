The members of the Illinois House of Representatives listed here\n                  by Knox represented Peoria and counties to the northwest of that city. It took ten\n                  rounds of voting in the joint session to reach a majority of votes for a single candidate.\n                  All of the members listed by Knox cast the majority of their votes over the course\n                  of the ten rounds for Lincoln, although Amos C. Babcock cast the sole vote forWilliam Kelloggin the first round of voting, and he and Samuel W. Brown voted forOrville H. Browningin the sixth round of balloting. By the ninth round of voting, anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullwas emerging as a compromise candidate and Babcock, William L. Lee and William C.\n                  Rice broke from Lincoln to support him in that round. For the tenth vote, Lincoln\n                  withdrew and urged his supporters to vote for Trumbull in order to ensure that an\n                  anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. All those named here voted for Trumbull\n                  in the tenth and final round of voting in which he emerged victorious.
