        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln andStephen A. Douglasheld the first of theLincoln-Douglas Debatesin Ottawa, Illinois,  on August 21, 1858. Pro-Douglas newspapers called Lincoln’s\n                  prose “weak, pusillanimous, loose, knock-kneed, straggling sentences—so barren of\n                  originality, or force and so heavily clogged and muddled with bad grammar, and clumsiness,”\n                  and emphasized Lincoln’s “weakness” over Douglas’s “immense ability.” They announced\n                  the “triumph” of Douglas and described Lincoln’s replies as “exceedingly lame throughout.”In June 1858, theIllinois Republican Conventionnominated Lincoln to challenge Douglas for theU.S. Senate. Lincoln invited Douglas to a series of debates on July 24, setting the stage for\n                  what would become one of the most famous local political contests in U.S. history\n                  and a precursor to the1860 presidential election. Prior to theseven debatesbetween Lincoln and Douglas, Lincoln had already made sixty-three speeches in 1858,\n                  and Douglas claimed to have made 130. Douglas, the incumbent, was more widely known\n                  than Lincoln and had the numeric advantage of theDemocratsin theIllinois General Assembly, which selected U.S. senators in those days. He also represented a divided party\n                  and faced a growing population in northernIllinoisthat was hostile to slavery. Lincoln, on the other hand, had the advantage of a unitedRepublican Party, a growing antipathy toward slavery in the state, and a reputation for integrity.\n                  Nevertheless, his views on racial issues were unpopular, as was his stand on theMexican War. The debates would highlight the fundamental differences in the men’s characters\n                  and focus on the main issues of the day, the expansion of slavery and racial equality.\n                  While the immediate effect of the debates was the reelection of Douglas, the long-term\n                  results were the opposite. Lincoln was catapulted to national prominence, allowing\n                  him to run for president in 1860, and Douglas’s campaign against Lincoln diminished\n                  his chances of future success.
