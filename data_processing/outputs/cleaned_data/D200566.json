California’s population\n                  met the constitutional requirement for admission as a state, and movement toward statehood\n                  had the political advantage of keeping members ofCongressfrom having to vote on the contentious issue of slavery in territories acquired fromMexicoafter theMexican War.  The admission of California as presumably a free state would also, at least in\n                  Baker’s opinion, ensure the Whig Party’s ascendency over theDemocrats.K.

On February 27, 1849, LincolnwroteTaylor  to urge Baker’s appointment, enclosing apetitionendorsing Baker signed by the Whig members of theIllinois General Assembly.   Taylor did not offer Baker a cabinet position. Like his predecessorJames K. Polk, Taylor apportioned his cabinet selections geographically.Thomas EwingofOhiorepresented the “Old Northwest” as secretary of the interior.The idea to send a special agent to California to hasten the adoption of a state constitution\n                  did not originate with Baker; Secretary of State John M. Clayton and Secretary of\n                  the NavyWilliam B. Prestonproposed similar ideas to President Taylor.  Taylor approved the plan, appointing\n                  RepresentativeThomas B.
