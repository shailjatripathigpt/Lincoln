He spoke afterStephen A. Douglasdelivered a speech promoting the act from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. earlier that day.Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the  Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name also began to circulate as a possible nominee to supplantJames Shieldsas U.S. Senator.Although Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, on November 25, 1854\n                  he officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for theU.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.On November 29, Lincoln wrote Randolph seeking help in canvassing members of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly  for support of his potential candidacy.   Randolphrespondedon December 5 that he did not thinkLouis H. Waters, an “old fashioned Whig” and  representative-elect fromMcDonough County, would consider it imprudent for Lincoln to write him.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 16 October 1854,http://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1854-10-16; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

Jackson, by one vote, but Jackson contested the outcome. Waters\n                  and Jackson agreed to a special election on December 30, which Waters ultimately won\n                  by nineteen votes.In the end, Lincoln  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General\n                  Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Waters switched his allegiance back and forth between Lincoln,Archibald Williams, andOrville H. Browningbefore casting his vote in the tenth and final ballot for Williams—becoming the onlyWhignot to unite on Trumbull’s candidacy. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln\n                  made no political speeches or public statements for an entire year after his defeat\n                  and reinvested his energies in his law practice.Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 3 January 1855, 3:1; S.
