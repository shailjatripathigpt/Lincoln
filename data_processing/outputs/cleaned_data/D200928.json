Ruggles\n                  was active in the nascentIllinoisRepublican Party, drafting the party’s first platform in 1856. Lincoln had presumably been asked either\n                  by letter or in person to speak at a political meeting inMason Countyon October 28, 1856. From July 1856 onwards, Abraham Lincoln gave over fifty speeches\n                  across Illinois in support of thepresidential campaignofJohn C. Fremontand to rally the disparate elements of the emerging Republican Party. See the1856 Federal Election.The Fremont Club of Mason County had held a meeting inHavanaon October 2, 1856, at whichWilliam Kellogg, the Republican candidate for theU.S. House of Representativesfor the Fourth Illinois Congressional District, gave a speech. Kellogg and hisDemocraticopponent,James W. Davidson, had agreed at that time to debate in Havana during court week. The act which placedMason County Circuit Courtin theFifth Judicial Circuitof Illinois set the court’s fall term to begin on the fourth Monday in October, which\n                  in 1856 would have been October 27.Despite the efforts of Republicans in Mason County, Fremont ultimately received only\n                  17.2 percent of the vote in the county, coming in third behind DemocratJames Buchananwho earned 47.4 percent of the vote, andAmerican PartycandidateMillard Fillmorewho garnered 35.6 percent. Although Kellogg was the overall winner of the race for\n                  the U.S. House of Representatives with 51.1 percent of the vote compared to Davidson’s\n                  45.7 percent, he performed poorly in Mason County, winning only 28.6 percent of the\n                  vote.The History of Menard and Mason Counties, Illinois(Chicago: O.
