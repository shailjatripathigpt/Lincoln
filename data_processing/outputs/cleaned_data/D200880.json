Hedrickin theIllinois Supreme Courtthe following year. No evidence has been found that Lincoln was directly involved\n                  in that case, although the opinion given by JusticeWalter B. ScatesinWalker and Smith v. Hedrickagreed with Lincoln’s opinion here. On November 29, 1855 James C. Walker purchased\n                  a tract of land inMcLean County, Illinoisthat was in one of the alternate sections reserved to the United States in the grant\n                  to Illinois for the Illinois Central Railroad. Walker then conveyed a portion of the\n                  land to John R. Smith in February 1856. Jacob Hedrick, however, claimed to have settled\n                  the land in question on November 1, 1855, and obtained a certificate of purchase as\n                  a pre-emptor on November 27, 1856. Walker and Smith filed a bill against Hedrick inMcLean County Circuit Courtin March 1857, and after the case was dismissed by that court, they appealed to the\n                  Illinois Supreme Court in April. In both Lincoln’s and Scates’ reading of the statutes,\n                  pre-emption could only be claimed on the alternate sections of land retained by the\n                  United States if the land in question was settled by the pre-emptor prior to the final\n                  allotment of alternate sections to a railroad by the General Land Office. As the final\n                  allotment of land to the Illinois Central Railroad was made in 1852, Scates found\n                  that Hedrick could not claim pre-emption on land he had settled in 1855 and found\n                  in favor Walker and Smith, overturning the McLean County Circuit Court’s dismissal\n                  of the case.Lincoln provided legal opinion, Martha L.
