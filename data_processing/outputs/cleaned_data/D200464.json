        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote these notes.John G. NicolayandJohn M. Hayin theComplete Works of Abraham Lincolndated this document “July 1?,” without attribution.  The third paragraph suggests\n                  that theTreaty of Guadalupe Hidalgoending theMexican Warhad yet to be ratified, making the July date seemingly untenable, the treaty having\n                  been ratified in mid-March 1848 and ratifications exchanged in May, though the treaty\n                  was not proclaimed until July.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, offers the date of March 1848, arguing that the date “assigned here seems as appropriate\n                  as can be assigned on the available evidence.”  Although lacking any attribution,\n                  Basler has a strong argument, as Lincoln and other supporters of Zachary Taylor, who\n                  was a potential presidential candidate for both theWhigandDemocraticparties in 1848, were urging him in the winter and spring of 1848 to make a statement\n                  regarding his political principles.   The editors have kept Basler’s date, but Lincoln\n                  could have offered these recommendations at any point during the winter and spring\n                  of 1848.Lincoln penned these recommendations in the context of his work as a member of the\n                  so-called “Young Indians,” a Whig Executive Committee founded byTruman Smithin the spring of 1847 to provide the Whig Party with a unified national organization\n                  for the imminentpresidential campaign of 1848.  Including principally but not exclusively Southern Whigs, the Young Indians made\n                  it their goal to nominate Zachary Taylor as the Whig Party standard bearer in 1848.\n                  Some Whigs condemned the movement for Taylor, a southern slaveholder who had no previous\n                  political affiliation, as an abandonment of Whig principles.  In the lead up to the\n                  presidential election of 1848, Taylor initially insisted on an independent candidacy\n                  separate from party, but his advisors convinced him that a public declaration of Whig\n                  principles was necessary for him to secure that party’s nomination. Taylor issued\n                  this declaration on April 22 in a letter addressed to John S. Allison, a Kentucky\n                  tobacco factor who was visiting him at the time. The Allison Letter included Taylor’s\n                  declaration, “I am a Whig, but not an Ultra Whig,” reiterating his intention to act\n                  above party. The letter had the desired effect of convincing doubters that Taylor\n                  was a Whig.The title is taken from what John M. Hay wrote on the last page.John G. Nicolay and John Hay, eds.,Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln,  new and enlarged ed. (New York: Francis D. Tandy, 1905), 2:55-56; Roy P. Basler,\n                     ed.,The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1:454; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:275-76; Holman Hamilton,Zachary Taylor: Soldier in the White House(Hamden, CT: Archon, 1966), 63-64; Michael F.

        "text": "4Ever since PresidentAndrew Jacksonmade broad use of the veto power to reject internal improvements, a National Bank,\n                  and other parts ofHenry Clay’s American System, the Whigs had railed against “executive usurpation.” Congressional\n                  supremacy became a mantra for the Whig Party, and Whig orators made what they deemed\n                  unconstitutional use of the veto power by Jackson’s successors a theme in most elections\n                  up to 1848. In the presidential campaign of 1848, Whigs sought to mobilize their supporters\n                  and gain neutral voters by claiming thatLewis Cass, the Democratic candidate, would continueJames K. Polk’s unconstitutional usurpation of power, most notably in commencing and waging the\n                  Mexican War.\n                  In his letter to John S. Allison, Taylor embraced the Whig notion of a weak executive,\n                  declaring that Congress should exercise leadership on the tariff, banks, and internal\n                  improvements, and that the executive should only use the veto power when a law was\n                  clearly unconstitutional.Norma Lois Peterson,The Presidencies of William Henry Harrison & John Tyler(Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1989), 14, 89-90, 97; Michael F.
