    "full_text": "Samuel D. Marshall to Abraham Lincoln, 20 April 18491 TheLane&Dormancase was decided against us at the last term of theWhite Circuit Court– As we could not prove much in the way of rents & profits above repairs we demurred\n\nto the bill & stood by it when over-ruled. Now, as I feel more interest in this case than all the business put together to which\n\nI ever attended I wish^you^to pay particular attention to what I shall say and after reflecting on it, to give\n\nme your views in time reach here before the 10thday of next month with time given for appeal. This case was sent back from theSupreme Courtfor amendment of the bill so as to account for the delay— but the amended bill being\n\na new one entirely the whole equity of it will be subject to examination on appeal–\n\nIt must be borne in mind that the original bill made no mention whatever of the sale\n\nby act of theLegislature, tho that question was before the court being brot to its knowledge by the bill of exceptions. They allude to it in their opinion. Now,\n\ncertainly it would seem that if they thought that ignorance of the powers of the Legislature\n\nin respect to the authority it assumed of ordering the sale of land & was a good\n\nexcuse for the long delay in making this application they would have said so. The\n\namended bill simply sets out facts & dates without sharing any extraordinary or other\n\ncause for delay of which the Court was not already aware. True it corrects an error\n\ninto which the Court fell by showing that Lane was not administrator of the estate^all the time^from his marriage with the widow to the date of application for sale of the land\n\nin the Circuit Court, But how does that<Page 2>affect thegreat principleof their decision based upon a variety of adjudications in other states. It matters\n\nnot whether Lane was admr all the while or not– If not admrhe could have compelled the application– He does not charge the admr(Brown) with refusal or inability to act.2How therefore is the extraordinary delay accounted for except that Lane did not know\n\nthe Legislature had no power to pass the act. Tho, not in the bill, all that was before the court when it reversedScatesJudgt. The application to the Legislature was not made for^five years afterLmarried widow^But there are grounds of objection to the bill stronger still in my judgment. 1stLane has no right to administration. His bill shows that the land was sold to pay\n\na certain debt due him & that he recd more than the amt– This was an extinguishment of the debt & of the administration. If the land was\n\nsold by mistake or illegality it does not alter thefactof payment &c tho the sale be a nullity. His proper & only remedy would be in assumpsit against the\n\nheir. 2dHe does not show that he has paid back the money to the purchasers or is liable to\n\ndo so, without this the bill is utterly defective & on this point I confidently look\n\nfor victory 3dThe estate ofRobertsonowed the Bank, Instead of filing the notes in the Probate office as the case required\n\nthey^L Brown & Lane admrs^received them in their own names and thus became liable for the debt. They had no\n\nright to do so &inthus voluntarily assuming the debt of Robertson they must bore it– They cannot make\n\nthe heir pay it back– The bill, gives us this history & defeats itself by^its own^showing. 4thThe bill does not show (as it should after such delay,)that dwhether the assets were all realized or what portion of them—whether<Page 3>the admrused due diligence– Whether Lane has prosecuted him on his bond &– 5thThe certificate of the Probate Justice (made part of the bill) does not show the numbers\n\nof the land belonging to the estate as the law requires, nor does it show to where\n\nthe debt is coming.

The court failed to execute the judgment, and in 1841, Lane sued the estate’s\n                  heirs,WilliamandNancy Dorman, who were represented by Marshall. In September 1842, theGallatin County Circuit Courtruled for Lane, and the Dormans retained Lincoln to appeal to theIllinois Supreme Court. The Supreme  Court ruled for the Dormans, basing its opinion upon Lincoln’s arguments.\n                  In February 1845, the Dormans signed a bond promising to convey to  Lincoln a one-third\n                  interest in 160 acres of the Robinson estate’s land if they won the case. Lincoln\n                  never took possession of the land, and in 1853, he andMary Lincolnsold the land to Dorman for $100.In May 1845, John C. Yost, Lane's son-in-law, sued William and Nancy Dorman in the Gallatin County Circuit\n                  Court to sell enough land from the Robinson estate to pay Lane’s $1,008.87 debt. \n                  The Dorman retained Marshall and Edwin B. Webb.  As Marshall notes, the White County\n                  Circuit Court ruled for Yost in March 1849, and the Dormans retained Lincoln and Marshall\n                  and appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court reversed the judgment.\n                  Chief JusticeSamuel H. Treatruled that the court need not sell the land, and Treat found an \"insuperable objection\"\n                  to Yost's petition.  The court declared that the evidence proved that no debt existed\n                  and that the previous debts had been discharged.For previous letters concerning the Dorman case, seeAbraham Lincoln to Samuel D.
