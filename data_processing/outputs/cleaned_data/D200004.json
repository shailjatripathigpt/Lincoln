Johnston.At their March 1831 term, the Sangamon County Commissioners’ Court received a petition\n                  signed by 304 citizens of the Springfield district, of which this petition was  a\n                  part, requesting the court to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation ofAdam Smith.  Smith may have resigned because he had been found guilty of assault and battery\n                  on Absalom Burnett and fined $4.  Although the General Assembly had changed the procedure\n                  in 1827, the Sangamon County Commissioners’ Court, satisfied that “a majority of the\n                  voters of this district” had signed the petition, granted the request and appointedWilliam Constantas constable.Minutes, 8, 11 March 1831, Sangamon County Commissioners’ Court Record Book C, 162,\n                     191, Illinois Regional Archives Depository, University of Illinois Springfield, Springfield,\n                     IL."
