        "text": "3Lincoln references James Shoaff’s lawsuit against Jackson C. Thompson.  In April 1851,\n                  Shoaff and E. S. Rogers sold Thompson theIllinois Reveille, aDemocraticnewspaper inPekin Illinois, for $1,000, and Thompson gave them promissory notes for the purchase price.  Thompson\n                  failed to pay a $225 note to Shoaff, and Shoaff retained Lincoln and Joseph S. McIntyre\n                  and sued Thompson in an action of assumpsit in theTazewell County Circuit Court, seeking $300 in damages.  Thompson argued that he paid off the note in question\n                  and filed a bill for discovery and injunction.  Thompson wanted the assumpsit suit\n                  dismissed.  Shoaff argued that the money that Thompson paid was actually for subscriptions\n                  and that Thompson never fulfilled the obligation of the note.  In April 1852, the\n                  parties agreed to dismiss the bill of discovery, and the court ruled for Shoaff in\n                  the assumpsit case and awarded him $184.48.Franklin William Scott,Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, vol. 6 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1910), 28, 276;History of Tazewell County Illinois(Chicago: Chas.
