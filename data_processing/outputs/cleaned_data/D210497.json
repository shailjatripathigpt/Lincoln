HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, had decided  to travel to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19.Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job\n                  went to Butterfield instead.
