The group used circulars, especially in the northern states,\n                  to highlight the dangers of admitting the Kansas Territory as a slave state and to\n                  urge anyone who was antislavery to move to Kansas and vote against the institution.Evansville Daily Journal(IN), 30 May 1854, 2:1; U.S. HouseReport of the Special Committee Appointed to Investigate the Troubles in Kansas34th Cong., 1st sess.

        "text": "4On March 2, 1854,Salmon P. Chasein the U.S. Senate moved to amend the Kansas-Nebaska bill to “expressly declare that\n                  the people of the Territory should have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit.”\n                  Senators rejected this amendment by a vote of 10 ayes to 36 nays.  Lincoln argued\n                  in the Freeport debate that Douglas should have supported this amendment, as it reflected\n                  the true intent and meaning of the law to allow territories to determine their own\n                  status of free or slave. Douglas claimed that he did not support the amendment to\n                  allow the territories to exclude slavery because the act already gave them the power\n                  to both introduce and exclude slavery, and that the amendment was simply a political\n                  move. Daniel Mace’s amendment expanded Chase’s to explicitly include the right of\n                  territories to both admit or exclude slavery. It was voted down.Mace’s and Chase’s proposed amendments ultimately became Republican dogma, as indicated\n                  in the platform adopted at the1856 Republican National Convention, which insisted thatCongress, and by extension territorial legislatures, had the power to either allow or exclude\n                  slavery in a territory before statehood.  TheU.S. Supreme Courtin its decision inScott vs Sandfordexpressly denied either Congress or territorial legislatures from excluding slavery\n                  in a territory.  Delegates at the 1858 Illinois Republican Convention denied the “political\n                  heresy” of the Dred Scott decision and reaffirmed the sovereign power of Congress\n                  and territorial legislature to  govern territories in all respects.U.S. SenateJournal. 1854. 33rd Cong., 1st sess., 231; Second Debate with Stephen A.

        "text": "5Galloway references one of the questions Lincoln directed to Douglas at the Freeport\n                  Debate--this question concerning the particulars of the English Bill, introduced by\n                  RepresentativeWilliam H. Englishin theU.S. House of Representativesin the spring of 1858. Designed to end the bloodyconflict over slavery in the Kansas Territory,  so-called English bill proposed sending theLecompton Constitutionback to the voters of the territory with a modification to the territory’s request\n                  for a federal land grant—reduced to 4 million acres from the requested 23 million\n                  acres. In essence, the bill offered Kansas voters statehood in exchange for accepting\n                  slavery. If Kansas voters rejected the offer, the English bill stipulated that the\n                  territory could not reapply for statehood until a census showed it possessed a population\n                  of at least 90,000 people.\n                  Douglas considered supporting the bill, but ultimately opposed it. The bill passed\n                  both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives on April 30, and PresidentJames Buchanansigned it into law. On August 2, Kansans overwhelmingly rejected this Lecompton Constitution-cum-land\n                  grant by a vote of 11,300 to 1,788.In the Freeport debate, Douglas reiterated his position on the English Bill, “I will\n                  not make any exception of Kansas to the other States of this Union. I hold it to be\n                  a sound rule of universal application to require Territories to contain the requisite\n                  population for a member of Congress before they came into the Union.” Of Congress’s\n                  attempt to make Kansas an exception to this rule, Douglas insisted, “Either Kansas\n                  must come in the same as any other State, with whatever population she may have, or\n                  the rule must be applied to all the other States alike.”In the same debate, Douglas also responded to Lincoln’s query about the power of territories\n                  that, “in my opinion the people of a Territory can by lawful means exclude slavery\n                  before it comes in as a State.”David M. Potter and Don E. Fehrenbacher,The Impending Crisis, 1848-1861(New York: Harper & Row, 1976), 323-25; Second Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Freeport, Illinois; Second Debate with Stephen A.
