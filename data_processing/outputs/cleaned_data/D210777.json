        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. Douglas had commenced his reelection campaign with a speech in Chicago on July 9,\n                  1858, which he repeated in Springfield on July 17. In these speeches, Douglas attacked\n                  Lincoln on two aspects of the latter’s June 16, 1858 speech in Springfield, the so-called\n                  “House Divided” speech.  Douglas first challenged Lincoln’s assertion that the United\n                  States could not continue to exist as half-slave and half-free, and argued that Lincoln\n                  was calling for uniformity in state laws and institutions and advocating sectional\n                  war between free and slave states. Douglas also took issue with Lincoln’s criticism\n                  of  the decision inScott v. Sandford.

        "text": "3As a member of theU.S. House of Representatives, Douglas voted to table the Wilmot Proviso to amend PresidentJames K. Polk’s August 8, 1846 request for funds to negotiate peace withMexico. He further voted against the engrossment of the amended appropriation bill and against\n                  its final passage.  When Douglas resumed his attempt to establish a territorial government\n                  forOregonin the next session of theU.S. Congress, his previously uncontroversial provision to prohibit slavery in Oregon was caught\n                  up in the continuing debate over the Wilmot Proviso. Southern legislators did not\n                  want Douglas to justify the prohibition of slavery in Oregon based on the language\n                  of theNorthwest Ordinanceas he initially did, as this language was similarly used in the Wilmot Proviso, which\n                  they also opposed. Instead, southern legislators desired him to ground Oregon’s potential\n                  status as a free territory on an extension of the Missouri Compromise, using the argument\n                  that Oregon was located north of the 36° 30’ north latitude stipulated by that measure\n                  as the dividing line for future slave and free states. An amendment to this effect\n                  failed, but Douglas pledged to support an extension of the Missouri Compromise line\n                  in place of the Wilmot Proviso’s prohibition of slavery in all land acquired from\n                  Mexico, and his Oregon bill ultimately passed. When the Wilmot Proviso came up for\n                  debate again in February 1847, Douglas proposed an ultimately unsuccessful amendment\n                  to establish an extension of the Missouri Compromise line as the basis for the Proviso’s\n                  limitations on slavery. Throughout debate on the Wilmot Proviso, Douglas opposed it\n                  as originally drafted.Robert W. Johannsen,Stephen A. Douglas(Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1997), 200-205."

The Kansas-Nebraska Act effectively\n                  superceded the Missouri Compromise by ignoring the latter’s stipulation that any new\n                  states north of 36° 30’ north latitude should enter the union as free states.Robert W.
