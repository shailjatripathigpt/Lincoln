Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate, having been selected as the Republican candidate at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionin June. Two of his campaign speeches in which he defended himself and the Republican\n                  Party that were published in newspapers were his July 10, 1858 speech inChicagoand his July 17, 1858 speech in Springfield. Of the two speeches, it is likely that\n                  Munsell had recently read Lincoln’s Springfield speech, as Lincoln had seen into publication\n                  in pamphlet form earlier in August, and had been dispatching copies of the pamphlet\n                  for distribution a few days prior to the date of this letter.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-58; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois;Abraham Lincoln to Gustave P.

TheChicago Tribunedescribed the audience for Lincoln’s Paris speech as “larger by five hundred persons\n                  than that which came together last month to make the Douglas ‘demonstration’”, not\n                  counting a sizeable contingent fromIndianawho had attended Douglas’ speech.At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest,\n                  and Edgar County was one such formerly Whig locale. As Munsell predicted, Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly were successful in Edgar County in the election\n                  of 1858. Edgar County constituted the Twenty-Fourth Illinois House of Representatives\n                  District, where RepublicanRobert Moseleyearned 1,453 votes and defeatedDemocratCharles Summers, who received 1,400 votes. The county was part of the Eighteenth Illinois Senate\n                  District, where RepublicanThomas A. Marshalldefeated DemocratUsher F. Linder. The  vote tally in Edgar County was 1,437 votes for Marshall, and 1,428 for Linder.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 7 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-07; Report of Speech at Paris, Illinois;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 11 September 1858, 2:5; Allen C.
