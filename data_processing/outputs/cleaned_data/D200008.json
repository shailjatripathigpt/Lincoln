    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to the People of Sangamon County, 9 March 18321 (COMMUNICATION.) To the people ofSangamo County. Fellow Citizens: Having become a candidate for the honorable office of one of your representatives\n\nin the nextGeneral Assemblyof this state, in accordance with an established custom, and the principles of true\n\nrepublicanism, it becomes my duty to make known to you—the people whom I propose to\n\nrepresent—my sentiments with regard to local affairs. Time and experience have verified to a demonstration, the public utility ofinternal improvements. That the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefitted\n\nby the opening of good roads, and in the clearing of navigable streams within their\n\nlimits, is what no person will deny. But yet it is folly to undertake works of this\n\nor any other kind, without first knowing that we are able to finish them—as half finished\n\nwork generally proves to be labor lost. There cannot justly be any objection to having\n\nrail roads and canals, any more than to other good things, provided they cost nothing.\n\nThe only objection is to paying for them; and the objection to paying arises from\n\nthe want of ability to pay. With respect to the county of Sangamo, some more easy means of communication than\n\nwe now possess, for the purpose of facilitating the task of exporting the surplus\n\nproducts of its fertile soil, and importing necessary articles from abroad, are indispensably\n\nnecessary. A meeting has been held of the citizens ofJacksonville, and the adjacent country, for the purpose of deliberating and enquiring into the\n\nexpediency of constructing a rail road from some eligible point on theIllinois river, through the town of Jacksonville, in Morgan county, to the town of Springfield,\n\nin Sangamo county.2This is, indeed, a very desirable object. No other improvement that reason will\n\njustify us in hoping for, can equal in utility the rail road. It is a never failing\n\nsource of communication, between places of business remotely situated from each other.\n\nUpon the rail road the regular progress of commercial intercourse is not interrupted\n\nby either high or low water, or freezing weather, which are the principal difficulties\n\nthat render our future hopes of water communication precarious and uncertain. Yet,\n\nhowever, desirable an object the construction of a rail road through our country may\n\nbe; however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of it—there is always\n\na heart appalling shock accompanying the account of its cost, which forces us to shrink\n\nfrom our pleasing anticipations. The probable cost of this contemplated rail road\n\nis estimated at $290,000;—the bare statement of which, in my opinion, is sufficient\n\nto justify the belief, that the improvement ofSangamo riveris an object much better suited to our infant resources. Respecting this view, I think I may say, without the fear of being contradicted, that\n\nits navigation may be rendered completely practicable, as high as the mouth of the\n\nSouth Fork,3or probably higher, to vessels of from 25 to 30 tons burthen, for at least one half\n\nof all common years, and to vessels of much greater burthen a part of that time.\n\nFrom my peculiar circumstances, it is probable that for the last twelve months I have\n\ngiven as particular attention to the stage of the water in this river, as any other\n\nperson in the country. In the month of March, 1831, in company with others, I commenced\n\nthe building of a flat boat on the Sangamo, and finished and took her out in the course\n\nof the spring.4Since that time, I have been concerned in the mill at New Salem. These circumstances\n\nare sufficient evidence, that I have not been very inattentive to the stages of the\n\nwater.—The time at which we crossed the mill dam, being in the last days of April,\n\nthe water was lower than it had been since the breaking of winter in February, or\n\nthan it was for several weeks after. The principal difficulties we encountered in\n\ndescending the river, were from the drifted timber, which obstructions all know is\n\nnot difficult to be removed. Knowing almost precisely the height of water at that\n\ntime, I believe I am safe in saying that it has as often been higher as lower since.5 From this view of the subject, it appears that my calculations with regard to the\n\nnavigation of the Sangamo, cannot be unfounded in reason; but whatever may be its\n\nnatural advantages, certain it is, that it never can be practically useful to any\n\ngreat extent, without being greatly improved by art. The drifted timber, as I have\n\nbefore mentioned, is the most formidable barrier to this object. Of all parts of\n\nthis river, none will require so much labor in proportion, to make it navigable, as\n\nthe last thirty or thirty-five miles; and going with the meanderings of the channel,\n\nwhen we are this distance above its mouth, we are only between twelve and eighteen\n\nmiles above Beardstown, in something near a straight direction; and this route is\n\nupon such low ground as to retain water in many places during the season, and in all\n\nparts such as to draw two-thirds or three-fourths of the river water at all high stages. This route is upon prairie land the whole distance;—so that it appears to me, by removing\n\nthe turf, a sufficient width and damming up the old channel, the whole river in a\n\nshort time would wash its way through, thereby curtailing the distance, and increasing\n\nthe velocity of the current very considerably, while there would be no timber upon\n\nthe banks to obstruct its navigation in future; and being nearly straight, the timber\n\nwhich might float in at the head, would be apt to go clear through. There are also\n\nmany places above this where the river, in its zig zag course, forms such complete\n\npeninsulas, as to be easier cut through at the necks than to remove the obstructions\n\nfrom the bends—which if done, would also lessen the distance. What the cost of this work would be, I am unable to say. It is probable, however,\n\nit would not be greater than is common to streams of the same length. Finally, I\n\nbelieve the improvement of the Sangamo river, to be vastly important and highly desirable\n\nto the people of this county; and if elected, any measure in the legislature having\n\nthis for its object, which may appear judicious, will meet my approbation, and shall\n\nreceive my support.6 It appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of interest, has\n\nalready been opened as a field for discussion; so I suppose I may enter upon it without\n\nclaiming the honor, or risking the danger, which may may await its first explorer. It seems as though we are never to have an end to this\n\nbaneful and corroding system, acting almost as prejudicial to the general interests\n\nof the community as a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on each\n\ncounty, for the benefit of a few individuals only, unless there be a law made setting\n\na limit to the rates of usury. A law for this purpose, I am of opinion, may be made,\n\nwithout materially injuring any class of people. In cases of extreme necessity there\n\ncould always be means found to cheat the law, while in all other cases it would have\n\nits intended effect. I would not favor the passage of a law upon this subject, which\n\nmight be very easily evaded. Let it be such that the labor and difficulty of evading\n\nit, could only be justified in cases of the greatest necessity.7 Upon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting\n\nit, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we as a people\n\ncan be engaged in. That every man may receive at least, a moderate education, and\n\nthereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries, by which\n\nhe may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object\n\nof vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the advantages\n\nand satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the scriptures and other\n\nworks, both of a religious and moral nature, for themselves. For my part, I desire\n\nto see the time when education, and by its means, morality, sobriety, enterprise and\n\nindustry, shall become much more general than at present, and should be gratified\n\nto have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which\n\nmight have a tendency to accelerate the happy period. With regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be necessary. Many\n\nrespectable men have suggested that our estray laws—the law respecting the issuing\n\nof executions, the road law, and some others, are deficient in their present form,\n\nand require alterations. But considering the great probability that the framers of\n\nthose laws were wiser than myself, I should prefer meddling with them, unless they\n\nwere first attacked by others, in which case I should feel it both a privilege and\n\na dnty to take that stand, which in my view, might tend most to the advancement of justice. But, Fellow-Citizens, I shall conclude.—Considering the great degree of modesty which\n\nshould always attend youth, it is probable I have already been more presuming than\n\nbecomes me. However, upon the subjects of which I have treated, I have spoken as\n\nI thought. I may be wrong in regard to any or all or them; but holding it a sound\n\nmaxim, that it is better to be only sometimes right, than at all times wrong, so soon\n\nas I discover my opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them. Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or not, I can\n\nsay for one that I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow\n\nmen, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem. How far I shall succeed in gratitying this ambition, is yet to be developed. I am young and unknown to many of you. I\n\nwas born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy\n\nor popular relations to recommend me. My case is thrown exclusively upon the independent\n\nvoters of this county, and if elected they will have conferred a favor upon me, for\n\nwhich I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate. But if the good people in\n\ntheir wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the back ground, I have been too familiar\n\nwith disappointments to be very much chagrined.8",

A meeting has been held of the citizens ofJacksonville, and the adjacent country, for the purpose of deliberating and enquiring into the\n               expediency of constructing a rail road from some eligible point on theIllinois river, through the town of Jacksonville, in Morgan county, to the town of Springfield,\n               in Sangamo county.2This is, indeed, a very desirable object.  No other improvement that reason will\n               justify us in hoping for, can equal in utility the rail road.  It is a never failing\n               source of communication, between places of business remotely situated from each other.\n               Upon the rail road the regular progress of commercial intercourse is not interrupted\n               by either high or low water, or freezing weather, which are the principal difficulties\n               that render our future hopes of water communication precarious and uncertain.  Yet,\n               however, desirable an object the construction of a rail road through our country may\n               be; however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of it—there is always\n               a heart appalling shock accompanying the account of its cost, which forces us to shrink\n               from our pleasing anticipations.  The probable cost of this contemplated rail road\n               is estimated at $290,000;—the bare statement of which,  in my opinion,  is sufficient\n               to  justify the belief, that the improvement ofSangamo riveris an object much better suited to our infant resources."

In the month of March, 1831, in company with others, I commenced\n               the building of a flat boat on the Sangamo, and finished and took her out in the course\n               of the spring.4Since that time, I have been concerned in the mill at New Salem.  These circumstances\n               are sufficient evidence, that I have not been very inattentive to the stages of the\n               water.—The time at which we crossed the mill dam, being in the last days of April,\n               the water was lower than it had been since the breaking of winter in February, or\n               than it was for several weeks after.  The principal difficulties we encountered in\n               descending the river, were from the drifted timber, which obstructions all know is\n               not difficult to be removed.  Knowing almost precisely the height of water at that\n               time, I believe I am safe in saying that it has as often been higher as lower since.5"

The drifted timber, as I have\n               before mentioned, is the most formidable barrier to this object.  Of all parts of\n               this river, none will require so much labor in proportion, to make it navigable, as\n               the last thirty or thirty-five miles; and going with the meanderings of the channel,\n               when we are this distance above its mouth, we are only between twelve and eighteen\n               miles above Beardstown, in something near a straight direction; and this route is\n               upon such low ground as to retain water in many places during the season, and in all\n               parts such as to draw two-thirds or three-fourths of the river water at all high stages."
