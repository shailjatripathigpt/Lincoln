Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. In his opening speech at the Ottawa debate, Douglas charged Lincoln with having\n                  helped to draft an antislaveryRepublican Partyplatform at a meeting inSpringfieldin October of 1854. In making this allegation, Douglas mistakenly quoted a more radical\n                  platform passed at a Republican meeting inAurorathat same year rather than the actual Springfield platform. Douglas also posed a\n                  series of questions to Lincoln in Ottawa aimed at forcing Lincoln to endorse or repudiate\n                  the antislavery positions of the Aurora platform. In his response at Ottawa, Lincoln\n                  denied having assisted in drafting the Springfield platform, not realizing that Douglas\n                  was quoting the incorrect platform.First Debate with Stephen A.

Despite Whitney’s advice in this letter, Lincoln began his opening speech at the\n                  Freeport debate by responding point by point to Douglas’ questions, then elaborated\n                  on his positions. At Freeport Lincoln also pointed out that the platform Douglas challenged\n                  him on was from the Republican meeting in Aurora in 1854 and not that held in Springfield\n                  the same year, and stated that he had failed to realize this because he had  not been\n                  involved with either meeting.Abraham Lincoln to Ebenezer Peck; Joseph Medill to Abraham Lincoln; Second Debate with Stephen A.

Toombs, and that he had done so in a manner that denied popular sovereignty to the people\n                  ofKansas Territory. Toombs’ bill provided for a path to a state constitutional convention for Kansas.\n                  When the bill was reported by the U.S. Senate Committee on Territories, of which Douglas\n                  was chairman, it no longer included a provision for any proposed constitution to be\n                  submitted to the residents of Kansas for  a vote, and Trumbull alleged that Douglas\n                  had removed this provision. In the fourth Lincoln-Douglas Debate inCharlestonon September 18, 1858, Lincoln shifted tactics on this subject from simply attesting\n                  to Trumbull’s honesty to arguing that Douglas had made the change.Ralph J.
