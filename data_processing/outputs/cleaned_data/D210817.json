In June,\n                  during the1858 Illinois Republican Convention, the Illinois Republican Party had nominated Lincoln as their candidate to replace\n                  incumbent Democrat Stephen A. Douglas in theU.S. Senate.Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458."

        "text": "6Frink references Douglas’ attacks of Lincoln’s criticism of the U.S. Supreme Court’s\n                  decision inScott v. Sandford. After Lincoln’s “House Divided” speech at the 1858 Illinois Republican Convention\n                  on June 16, Douglas had attacked Lincoln publicly and appealed to Illinoisans’ racism,\n                  claiming that Lincoln criticized theDred Scott decisionbecause Lincoln favored full social and political equality between the races. Douglas\n                  had also denounced Lincoln and his fellow Republicans’ criticism of the decision as\n                  disloyal, arguing that law-abiding U.S. citizens were obligated support all U.S. Supreme\n                  Court decisions. Douglas made this argument despite the fact that he had previously\n                  praised PresidentAndrew Jacksonfor defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the 1819 caseMcCulloch v. Maryland, when the court declared that theU.S. Congresshad the power to create a national bank. In his July 17 speech in Springfield, Lincoln\n                  asserted that, “Judge Douglas isfor[sic] Supreme Court decisions when he likes and against them when he does not like them.\n                  He is for the Dred Scott decision because it tends to nationalize slavery.”Frink also references the creation of the Illinois Supreme Court, recommending that\n                  Lincoln raise Douglas’ role in the creation of this court during thecampaign of 1858. During the 1840-41 winter session of theIllinois General Assembly, Democratic leaders in Illinois—including Douglas—lobbied hard for a reorganization\n                  of the Illinois Supreme Court in the hopes of breaking theWhig Party’s hold on the bench. Lincoln, a member of theIllinois House of Representativesat the time, vigorously protested this politically-based reorganization of the court.\n                  Nevertheless, in February 1841, the General Assembly passed abill, abolishing the existing state circuit courts, enlarging the state supreme court\n                  by adding five judges to its bench, and having the nine judges of the newly-reorganized\n                  Illinois Supreme Court hold sessions for circuit courts. Democratic GovernorThomas Carlinthen nominated Douglas for a seat on the court, and, also in February 1841, the members\n                  of the Illinois General Assembly elected Douglas to the seat. Douglas held the position\n                  for three years.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:163-64, 468, 470; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Henry M.

        "text": "7If Lincoln replied to this letter, his response has not been located. Frink wrote Lincoln one more letter related to the elections of 1858. Both Lincoln and Douglas\n                  continued discussing the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision throughout the campaign\n                  of 1858.In the race for the state’s Sixth Congressional District seat in the U.S. House of\n                  Representatives, Matheny lost to Harris with 41.4 percent of the vote to Harris’ 57.6\n                  percent.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:464-69, 501, 503, 510, 556-57; Howard W.
