Ficklin\n                  or Abraham Lincoln sometime during the 30th Congress. Although the petition is located\n                  in a collection of petitions presented to the U.S. House of Representatives that were\n                  committed to committees, editors could find no evidence of it having been introduced\n                  or referred to the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, of which Lincoln was\n                  a member."
