        "text": "2In his June 16, 1858, “House Divided” speech, Abraham Lincoln asserted regarding the\n                  Dred Scott decision that while the, “Constitution of the United States neither permits\n                  Congress nor a Territorial Legislature to exclude Slavery from any United States Territory,\n                  they all omit to declare whether or not the same Constitution permits a State, or\n                  the people of a State, to exclude it.” He went on to argue that this omission left\n                  room for anotherSupreme Courtdecision declaring that the U.S. Constitution does not permit a state to exclude\n                  slavery from its limits.Steven A. Douglasresponded in his July 9, 1858, speech inChicagothat he took issue with any criticism of a Supreme Court ruling, and opined that\n                  once a Supreme Court decision was issued, “all other opinions must yield to the majesty\n                  of that authoritative adjudication.”Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided: Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Robert W.

        "text": "3Before 1857, Douglas believed that the Supreme Court had the authority to decide if\n                  the people of a territory could exclude slavery. In his July 9, 1858 speech, Douglas\n                  expounded on his belief in the doctrine that states and territories should be governed\n                  by popular sovereignty, meaning that the said states or territories were free to choose\n                  their status in regard to slavery.  Lincoln disagreed, stating in debate between the\n                  two men on August 21 inOttawa, “my understanding is that Popular Sovereignty, as now applied to the question of\n                  Slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have Slavery if they want to, but\n                  does not allow them not to have it if they do not want it.”Robert W.

        "text": "5Lincoln believed that the passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actin 1854, establishing  popular sovereignty as a means of deciding slave status for\n                  southwestern territories,  was part of a larger conspiracy to make slavery perpetual\n                  and national. In the Freeport debate on August 27, Lincoln asked Douglas, “Can the\n                  people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen\n                  of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a\n                  State Constitution?” Douglas responded by establishing what became called his “Freeport\n                  Doctrine.” The central belief he espoused stated that slavery could not exist without\n                  “friendly legislation” to  protect it. Therefore, Douglas argued, the people of a\n                  territory, prior to establishing a state constitution, could determine their slave\n                  status by either passing legislation to protect it or by passing legislation “unfriendly”\n                  to slavery. In the same debate, Lincoln stated, “I am impliedly, if not expressly,\n                  pledged to the belief in therightanddutyof Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States Territories.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:513-14; Second Debate with Stephen A.
