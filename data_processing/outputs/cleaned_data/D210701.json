        "text": "2The man who had pled guilty to stealing from the American Express Company was namedOrin F. Jones, not J. O. Jones. Orin F. Jones was an agent of the company inTolono, Illinois, in 1857 when a package containing $509.15 which had been consigned to the company\n                  was stolen. At the time, Jones was living with a woman who those involved in the case\n                  were uncertain was his legal wife. It was suggested  that this woman had either stolen\n                  the property or influenced Jones to do so, and that in pleading guilty Jones was protecting\n                  her. Jones entered his plea at the April 1858 term of theChampaign County Circuit Courtand was sentenced by JudgeDavid Davisto one year in prison.The identity of Orin F. Jones’ brother who presented this letter to Abraham Lincoln\n                  is unknown. One brother of Jones’ who intervened in his case was  George O. Jones,\n                  who lived in Onondaga County, New York and was assistant sergeant-at-arms of the New York State Assembly in 1858. George O. Jones wrote to Illinois GovernorWilliam H. Bissellon his brother’s behalf in February, 1859.Newspaper Report, Document ID: 130501; Letter, Document ID: 130505,McKinley requested Lincoln’s assistance in obtaining pardon, Martha L.

Lamon, who had served as the prosecuting attorney on the case. Bissell ultimately waited\n                  until Jones had served almost his entire sentence before pardoning him, thus restoring\n                  his rights of citizenship without shortening his sentence.McKinley requested Lincoln’s assistance in obtaining pardon, Martha L.
