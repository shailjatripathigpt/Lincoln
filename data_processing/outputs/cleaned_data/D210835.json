        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln was prompted towriteBurton C. Cook on August 2, 1858, by aletterdated July 31, 1858 that was written to him andWilliam H. HerndonbyHenry C. Whitney. Whitney’s letter reported a rumor of a movement to challengeRepublicancandidates inBureauandLa Sallecounties in the state andfederal election of 1858. The two counties were in the Third Congressional District of Illinois, whereChurchill Coffingwas being recruited to run as an independent candidate to draw votes away from incumbent\n                  RepublicanOwen Lovejoyin the race for theU.S. House of Representatives.Lincoln himself had been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentDemocratStephen A. Douglas to represent Illinois in theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.Howard W.

Attempts from conservative Republicans and Democrats to either\n                  replace Lovejoy as the Republican candidate or challenge him with an independent opponent\n                  continued to be a concern throughout the campaign of 1858.Abraham Smith to Abraham Lincoln;Stephen G.

        "text": "4Despite Whitney’s and Lincoln’s concerns, the Republican candidates for U.S. House\n                  of Representatives and Illinois General Assembly in Bureau and La Salle counties were\n                  ultimately successful in the election of 1858. In the race for the U.S. House of Representatives\n                  in the Third Congressional District of Illinois, Coffing was indeed put forward to\n                  challenge Lovejoy. Coffing, however, withdrew from the race in October, 1858 and Lovejoy\n                  won his reelection bid, defeating Douglas Democrat George W. Armstrong andBuchananDemocrat David Le Roy.Republican candidates also won the three seats in the Illinois General Assembly that\n                  were up for election in these counties in 1858. Bureau and La Salle counties were\n                  both in the Seventh Illinois Senate District, where Republican Burton C. Cook held\n                  over in the election of 1858. Bureau County comprised the Forty-Seventh Illinois House\n                  District, where RepublicanJohn H. Bryantwon the election with 2,570 votes, while his opponents, Buchanan Democrat Thomas\n                  Tustin (Tusten) and Douglas Democrat Benjamin L. Smith received 786 and 611 votes\n                  respectively. No evidence has been found of an independent candidate running in the\n                  Forty-Seventh House District. La Salle County was in the Forty-Third Illinois House\n                  District, in which RepublicansAlexander CampbellandRichardson S. Hickearned 4,139 and 4,089 votes respectively, defeating Democratic candidates Samuel\n                  C. Collins and William Cogswell, who earned 3,383 and 3,412 votes respectively. Two\n                  other unidentified candidates named McBurney and Hoffman appeared in the election\n                  returns for the Forty-Third House District in this race. Their party affiliations\n                  are not indicated, and they received only 29 and 22 votes respectively.Like Glover, Owen Lovejoyrespondedto Lincoln that he was unconcerned when informed of the rumored threat to Republican\n                  candidates in the region.The Ottawa Free Trader(IL), 30 October 1858, 2:1; 6 November 1858, 3:2;The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 13 September 1858, 2:1-2; 9 October 1858, 2:2;The Belvidere Standard(IL), 21 September 1858, 3:1;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 21 October 1858, 2:5; 11 November 1858, 2:5; Howard W.
