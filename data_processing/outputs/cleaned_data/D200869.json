Loughborough purchased around 3,000 acres in the western portion\n                  of   Champaign County, Illinois. In 1845, Loughborough conveyed the majority of that\n                  land to J. Graves ofKentuckyand the remainder to Lawrence Young.  Loughborough did not record either deed at\n                  the time.  Laurence Young’s deed, dated March 10, 1845, was for 480 acres. Speed requested\n                  that Lincoln have it recorded and search for tax-titles.  In 1873, Young still owned\n                  400 acres in that county, which he directed to be sold in his will.Urbana Union(Urbana, IL), 11 March 1858, 3:1;Abraham Lincoln to James M.
