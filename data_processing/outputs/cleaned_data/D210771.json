        "text": "2Stephen A. Douglas had commenced his 1858 campaign for reelection to theU.S. Senatewith a speech in Chicago on July 9, 1858, in which he criticized the so-called “House\n                  Divided” speech delivered by Lincoln on June 16, 1858, at theIllinois Republican Conventionin Springfield. Lincoln followed with a speech in Chicago on July 10 in which he\n                  rebutted Douglas’ characterization of the language he used in describing the United\n                  States as a “House Divided” and denied that he advocated sectional division or that\n                  he desired that the federal government have power over individual state matters. Lincoln\n                  also explained in his Chicago speech that he felt Douglas misrepresented his opposition\n                  to the decision in the case ofScott v. Sandfordas resistence to the enforcement of the law. Although he argued for the overturning\n                  of the case, Lincoln stated he still intended to abide by it while it was law.Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided: Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Robert W.
