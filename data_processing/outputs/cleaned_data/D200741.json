Mason Brayman\n                  was an attorney for theIllinois Central Railroad, which, by the time of this telegram, may have hired Lincoln to represent it. Although\n                  it is unclear precisely when Lincoln was initially hired by the railroad, he represented\n                  it in theChampaign County Circuit Courtin May 1853 in the caseIllinois Central Railroad v. McGinnis. Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, speculates that this telegram may have been related to this case in some way.On October 7, 1853, BraymanwroteLincoln to officially retain his services on behalf of the Illinois Central Railroad,\n                  enclosing a retainer fee of $250 for Lincoln.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 4 May 1853,http://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1853-05-04; Sandra K.
