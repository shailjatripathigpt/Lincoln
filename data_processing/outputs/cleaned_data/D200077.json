That I once had the confidence of the people ofSangamon; is sufficiently evident, and if\n\nI have since done any thing, either by design or misadventure, which if known, would\n\nsubject me to a\n\nforfeiture of that confidence, he that knows of that thing,\n\nand conceals it, is a traitor to his country's interest. I find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or facts, real or\n\nsupposed, you spoke;\n\nbut my opinion of your veracity, will not permit me, for a moment, to doubt, that\n\nyou at least believed\n\nwhat you said. I am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me, but I do hope that,\n\non more mature\n\nreflection, you will view the public interest as a paramount consideration, and, therefore,ldetermine to\n\nlet the worst come. I here assure you; that the candid statement of facts, on your\n\npart, however low it\n\nmay sink me, shall never break the tie of personal friendship between us. I wish an answer to this, and you are at liberty to publish both if you choose3",
