He attempted to make the farmer believe that the high pressure\n\ntariff made every thing they bought cheaper, but said also he could not tell the reason,\n\nbut that it was so, and I suppose that is enough for the huge farmer to know. Now,\n\nthe little boys who Mr. Lincoln enlightened as to what the tariff was, could have\n\ntold him better than to make such a statement. He then proceeded along very calmly,\n\nuntil Mr. Baker handed him aState Register, containing some extracts from the papers ofAlex. Hamilton; then he rolled his eyes and shook his head, as if he had seen an Irishman. I think\n\nI never saw such a stew as that piece threw them into; Lincoln came near having a\n\nchicken fit, and a choking to death; but fortunately some water was proeured and he got over it.",
