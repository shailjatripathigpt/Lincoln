    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to Andrew Johnston, 18 April 18461 Yourletter, written some six weeks since, was received in due course, and also the paper with\n\nthe parody.2It is true, as suggested it might be, that I have never seenPoe’s “Raven”; and I very well know that a parody is almost entirely dependent for its\n\ninterest upon the reader’s acquaintance with the<Page 2>original.3Still there is enough in the polecat, self-considered, to afford one several hearty\n\nlaughs. I think four or five of the last stanzas are decidedly funny, particularly\n\nwhere Jeremiah “scrubbed and washed, and prayed and fasted.” I have not yourletternow before me; but, from memory, I think you ask me who is the author of the piece\n\nI sent you, and that you do so ask as to indicate a slight suspicion that I myself\n\nam the author.4Beyond all question, I am not the author. I would give all I am worth, and go in\n\ndebt, to be able to write so fine a piece<Page 3>as I think that is. Neither do I know who is the author. I met it in a straggling\n\nform in a newspaper last summer, and I remember to have seen it once before, about\n\nfifteen years ago, and this is all I know about it. The piece of poetry of my own\n\nwhich I alluded to, I was led to write under the following circumstances. In the fall\n\nof 1844, thinking I might aid some to carry the State ofIndianafor Mr.Clay, I went into the neighborhood in that State in which I was raised, where my mother\n\nand only sister were buried, and from which I had been absent about fifteen years.5That part of the country is, within itself, as unpeotical as any spot of the earth;\n\nbut still, seeing it and its objects and inhabitants aroused feelings<Page 4>in me which were certainly poetry; though whether my expression of those feelings\n\nis poetry is quite another question. When I got to writing, the change of subjects\n\ndivided the thing into four little divisions or cantos, the first only of which I\n\nsend you now and may send the others hereafter.6 My childhood’s home I see again,And sadden with the view; And still, as memory crowds my brain,There’s pleasure in it too. O Memory! thou midway world‘Twixt earth and paradise, Where things decayed and loved ones lostIn dreamy shadows rise, And, freed from all that’s earthly vile,Seem hallowed, pure, and bright, Like scenes in some enchanted isleAll bathed in liquid light. As dusky mountains please the eyeWhen twilight chases day; As bugle-notes that, passing by,In distance die away; As leaving some grand waterfall,We, lingering, list its roar— So memory will hallow allWe’ve known, but know no more. Near twenty years have passed awaySince here I bid farewell To woods and fields, and scenes of play,And playmates loved so well. Where many were, but few remainOf old familiar things; But seeing them, to mind againThe lost and absent brings. The friends I left that parting day,How changed, as time has sped! Young childhood grown, strong manhood gray,And half of all are dead. I hear the loved survivors tellHow nought from death could save, Till every sound appears a knell,And every spot a grave. I range the fields with pensive tread,And pace the hollow rooms, And feel (companion of the dead)I’m living in the tombs.7",
