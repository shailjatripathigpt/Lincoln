Whereas, the principle of size and weight is now adopted in the laws of the United\n\nStates as the basis of post-office charges; and, whereas, newspapers not exceeding\n\n1900 square inches are chargeable at the rate of 1 cent for 100 miles, and 1½ cents\n\nfor all greater distances, if without the state in which they are published; your\n\npetitioners would urge the importance of reducing said charges at leastone halfon all papers not containing more than 500 square inches.2 Your petitioners represent that, within a few years past, numerous juvenile papers\n\nhave sprung up in different sections of the United States, for the instruction of\n\nthe young in science, morals, and religion, which papers are now extensively patronized\n\nby children, who, notwithstanding these papers are usually notone quarterthe size or weight allowed by law, have to pay on them the same postage that is charged\n\non the largest sheets that pass through the mails. Besides the manifest injustice\n\nof this regulation, your petitioners represent that many thousands of children and\n\nyouth are deterred from subscribing to these useful papers solely by the comparatively\n\nexcessive postage chargeable on the small sheets they desire to obtain. A reduction, therefore, of postage, in favor of juvenile newspapers of small dimensions,\n\nwould not only tend greatly to diffuse knowledge and piety, the bulwarks of our national\n\nprosperity, but would increase the revenues of thepost-office department. For an immediate and proportionate reduction of postage, therefore, on all newspapers\n\nnot containing more than 500 square inches, your petitioners respectfully and urgently\n\npray.",
