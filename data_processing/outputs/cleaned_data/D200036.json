That notation was an error, as\n                  Township 17 North is south of Athens, rather than north as Lincoln’s map indicates.\n                  Lincoln’s map actually shows the location of the road from Athens northward to the\n                  boundary line of Township 18 North, rather than 17 North.On December 1, the Sangamon County Commissioners’ Court accepted the report and survey,\n                  ordered the road to be opened, and allowed Lincoln $3.50 for his services as surveyor.Sangamon County Commissioners Court Record Book D (1833-1840), 101-102, Manuscripts\n                     Division, Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Springfield IL."
