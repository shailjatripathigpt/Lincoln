        "text": "3This is a reference to evidence used in the caseParker v. Hoyt, in which Lincoln was an attorney for the defendant, along withGrant GoodrichandGeorge W. Meeker. In the case,Zebulon ParkersuedCharles Hoytin theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinois, for violating Parker’s patent, which he secured in October 1829.In the initial trial, the jury found for Parker. However, Hoyt motioned for a new\n                  trial, which the court granted. During the second trial, which took place July 9-24,\n                  1850, the defense provided evidence via experiments conducted on Hoyt’s water wheels.\n                  These experiments demonstrated that the modifications Hoyt had made to his water wheels\n                  produced no effect on the movement of water through them. This called into question\n                  Parker’s fundamental claim that Hoyt’s modifications to his water wheels represented\n                  an infringement upon Parker’s patent. When Parker’s legal team conducted their own\n                  experiments, they only bolstered the defense team’s evidence by demonstrating that\n                  the technology Parker patented did not actually function. The jury found for Hoyt.\n                  Parker then motioned for a new trial, which the court granted, and the case lingered\n                  on through the early 1850s. In July 1855, Lincoln succeeded in having the case dismissed\n                  in theU.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois.Parker v. Hoyt, Martha L.

        "text": "4On March 3, 1851, theU.S. Congresspassed an act that, among other things, set new terms for theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinoisin Chicago. The court had previously met annually on the first Monday in June and\n                  the first Monday in December but would thereafter meet annually on the first Monday\n                  in July and the third Monday in December. The act also added additional terms, on\n                  the first Tuesday of October and third Tuesday of April each year.Lincoln appears to have interpreted the section of the act that discusses “return\n                  of process” to mean that lawsuits originating in Springfield would remain there for\n                  trial and could not be transferred to Chicago, even if the volume of lawsuits meant\n                  that they would be pushed to a later court session for trial.“An Act Providing for an Additional Term of the United States Circuit and District\n                     Courts at Chicago, in the District of Illinois,” 3 March 1851,Statutes at Large of the United States9 (1862):636-37."
