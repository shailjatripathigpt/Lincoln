In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Mercer Countywas part of the Fourth Illinois Congressional District in 1858.  A Republican stronghold,\n                  Mercer County helpedWilliam Kelloggwin reelection to theU.S. House of Representativesrepresenting the Fourth District.  In state electoral politics, Mercer County belonged\n                  to the Ninth Illinois Senate District and the Forty-Eighth Illinois House District\n                  in 1858.Thomas J. Henderson, a Republican and hold over from the 1856 state election, continued to represent\n                  Mercer County in the Illinois Senate in 1858.  Republicans in the Forty-Eighth District\n                  nominatedEphraim Gilmore, Jr., for the Illinois House of Representatives in the state elections of 1858. Gilmore\n                  defeated his Democratic opponent for the seat.  Both Henderson and Gilmore voted for\n                  Lincoln in the contest for U.S. Senate.Allen C.
