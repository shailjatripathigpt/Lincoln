Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, dated this declaration February 14, 1852. The editors have retained Basler’s dating\n                  of this document, since it is likely that Lincoln wrote the declaration at the same\n                  time as his notice to Henry Prather.

        "text": "2In American law, “trespass” refers to  an action to obtain compensation for a forcible\n                  wrong against the plaintiff. Such wrongs could have been directed against the plaintiff\n                  personally (a lawsuit known as “Trespass Vi Et Armis”), against his or her land (a\n                  suit known as “Trespass Quare Clausum Fregit”), or against his or her personal property.\n                  The plaintiff was entitled to damages if he or she could prove that the defendant\n                  used force or violence with immediate and direct consequences. If the plaintiff sustained\n                  a delayed injury, the court would not award damages in a trespass action.“Ejectment” relates to an action to recover land or other real property and to collect\n                  damages. Originally, in the English common law, only tenants could use this action\n                  to recover possession of land from which they had been unlawfully ousted. Because\n                  of the simplicity and swiftness of the ejectment procedure, landowners began to use\n                  this action to recover land. To do so, the landowner, on behalf of a fictitious tenant\n                  (John Doe), sued a fictitious defendant (Richard Roe) for ousting the fictitious tenant.\n                  The court titled such cases John Doe ex dem. “Landowner” v. Richard Roe. When the\n                  defendant appeared in court, the clerk sometimes replaced “Richard Roe” with the defendant’s\n                  real name. In anactpassed in March 1839, theIllinois General Assemblyabolished the need for the fictitious names. The losing party in an ejectment case\n                  was entitled by law to one new trial simply by paying the court costs.“Ejectment;” “Trespass,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

Prather, a case which was tried in the Macon County Circuit Court and in which Lincoln represented\n                  the plaintiffs. In the case, Thomas Johnston and Jonathan Brown  bought land from\n                  the trustees of schools of Macon County’s township 16N, range 1E on August 31, 1837.\n                  Johnston and Brown also mortgaged the land to secure payment and gave their mortgage\n                  notes to the school commissioners. When they failed to pay taxes on the land, it was\n                  put up for sale in 1843 in order to recover the taxes due. Prather purchased the land\n                  during this sale, securing a tax deed for the purchase. A tax deed is a form of conveyance\n                  (transfer of property ownership between people via written instrument) in which a\n                  sale of lands is made for non-payment of taxes. An officer of the law, such as a sheriff,\n                  uses a tax deed to convey the title of the proprietor of the land to the purchaser\n                  of the land at the tax sale.The trustees of the township believed that they still owned the land due to the mortgage\n                  that Johnston and Brown had obtained on it.  The trustees retained Lincoln as their\n                  attorney, and sued Prather in an action of ejectment.Illinois Public Domain Land Tract Sales, Macon County, 818:105, Illinois State Archives, Springfield, IL ; Henry Campbell\n                     Black,A Dictionary of Law(St. Paul, MN: West, 1891), 1154; “Conveyance,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

However, per the laws related to ejectment action, Prather\n                  was entitled to a new trial once he paid the court fees. He paid the fees, and Judge\n                  Davis granted him a new trial  in October 1854, but no new trial occurred.
