    "full_text": "Anson G. Henry and Others to the Readers of The Old Soldier, 12 October 18401 This number of the “Old Soldier,” closes the period for which it was originally designed\n\nto be published. Should any important event transpire, which would render it necessary\n\nthat we should again address you before theElection; we shall do so through an “Extra-Old Soldier.” The present is a most befitting time, on our part, to address you. The solicitude\n\nwe feel in the answer to that question—“FOR WHOM WILL ILLINOIS VOTE AT THE COMING\n\nELECTION?” impels us to make to you a most earnest appeal; and in making that appeal,\n\nwe would so represent the importance of the coming election, as to arouse the slumbering\n\nenergies of our people into action, and insure the exercise of the right of suffrage\n\nby every freeman within the bounds of our State. Butthree weeksmore, and the greatest political battle is to be fought that has convulsed this Nation\n\nfrom the hour the Declaration of Independence was made, down to the present day.The resultis to be, either a continuation of those embarrassments, wrongs and oppressions,\n\nunder which this whole Union has been groaning during the entire existence of thepresent Administration;—or a speedy return to those happy days of prosperity, with which, as a People, we\n\nwere blessed before theelectionofMartin Van Buren. That the latter will be the result of the coming struggle, we entertain not a reasonable\n\ndoubt; but,to us, the great question is,—“Shall the name ofIllinoisbe inscribed upon the pages of history as among those States which in 1840, succeeded\n\nin banishing from the highest place of Trust known to the People of this Republic,\n\nan individual who had secured that station without merit of his own, and who sought\n\nto retain it, by usurping to himself, the control ofCongress, and of the Sword and the Purse of the Nation; or, shall our beloved State be the\n\nbiographer of her own disgrace, in being numbered amongst the five or six States,\n\nwho ingloriously sought to continue him in power?” This question, fellow countrymen, is an important one. Its answer affects our reputation—our\n\nmoral and intellectual advancement—and our future prosperity;—and as you value all\n\nthese, so let us entreat you, at the approaching election, to exercise the inestimableRight of Suffrage. TheEnemies of Powerand theFriends of the People, are sufficient in number to carry the State for thePatrioAllt Harrison, if they will but be vigilant, and active, from this time to the Election. The numerical\n\nstrengthwe have, ifallwill but go to the ballot boxes and deposit their votes. It isour own supineness and indifference to the result of the contest in this State, that we haveto fear and guard against—not the numbers of our untiring opponents. But one feeling should animate the bosom\n\nof everyHarrison manin the State,—that upon ☞HIS VOTE☜ depends the contest;—and then, whether blessed\n\nwith health in the vigor of manhood, or laboring under the infirmities of age—or palsied\n\nby the hand of disease;—no manwithin our borders wouldlose his vote!This donetheVictory is ours!—and Illinois will have cast off the chains of Despotism that Martin Van Buren is\n\nattempting to rivet upon her; and will proudly take her stand among theRedeemed Statesof the Union—striptof her Regal robes, but arrayed in the plain and imposing garb ofAmerican Liberty!We are not unconscious of the vile and despicable means that are daily employing\n\nto defeatthe People, and ensure success on the part of thosein Power. The entire control of thepurse stringsof the nation now vestedin thePresident—theone hundred thousand office-holders dependent on his will and pleasure for official\n\nexistence!are, to a man, against us! ThePost-Office Department—that great medium for thefreedissemination of information, political and religious, throughout our land—controlled\n\nby one of his mostfawning and pliant sycophants,—daily scattering through the country “thousands and tens of thousands” of the “Extra Globe,” filled with the most barefaced falsehoods and misrepresentations—appealing to the\n\nbasest passions of the human heart—and charging upon theVeteranHarrison the most groundless andblackest calumniesthe human mind can invent—allemanating from the pen of that modernRobespiere, ☞Amos Kendall; while the Harrison papers containing their refutations,are withheld, until the poison, in their opinion, has had timeto take effect;—are, indeed,formidable weapons,against which thePeoplehave to contend:—But formidable as they may appear, and as successful as Martin Van\n\nBuren, the author of them, may hope they will prove, he will find to his discomfiture\n\nand dismay, that he has mostgrossly misjudged the American People. In the States ofConnecticut—Rhode Island—Virginia—Louisiana—North Carolina—Alabama—Kentucky—Indiana—VermontandMaine—where elections have already been held,—he has been stricken withthe lightning of public opinion,and while he now stands a notable testimony of its power, ere the Ides of November\n\nhave passed, he will find that he cannotagain bear its visitation without being utterly consumed.2 Rally, then, Freemen of Illinois! under the banner of the Constitution—of Harrison\n\nand Liberty! Rekindle in your own breasts the fire of Patriotism that animated those\n\nof your Forefathers in the glorious struggle for Independence; and from this time\n\nuntilthe battle is ended, devote your time—your exertions—and every energy of your mindin the cause of your country;and in the attempt now making to rescue her violated Constitution and Laws from the\n\nhands ofMartin Van Buren. Between him anddespotic power, there is butone more stride.—Re-elect him, and that will soon be taken. Re-elect him, and therequiem of our departed liberty, will be chaunted byevery despotic nation upon earth. Defeat him, and the pure principles ofWashington,JeferrsonandMadison, and their illustrious compeers, will again control our National Councils—the blighting\n\ninfluence of bad counsel and bad government will pass away—and Internal Peace, and\n\nNational and Individual prosperity, will again bless a smiling, united and happy land.3",
