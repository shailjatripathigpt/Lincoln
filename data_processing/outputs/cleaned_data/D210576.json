Lincoln wrote several letters to political allies  in November and December of 1854,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats.Abraham Lincoln to Hugh Lamaster;Abraham Lincoln to Joseph Gillespie;Abraham Lincoln to Horace W.

        "text": "4Archibald Williams had run againstDemocratincumbentWilliam A. Richardsonto represent Illinois’ Fifth Congressional District in theU.S. House of Representatives.  Richardson retained his seating, winning 52.4 percent of the district’s votes to\n                  Williams’ 47.6 percent.Similarly, Richard Yates had sought reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives\n                  as the representative for Illinois’  Sixth Congressional District.Thomas L. Harris, Yates’ Democratic opponent, defeated him by 200 votes. Harris garnered 50.5 percent\n                  of the vote to Yates’ 49.5 percent.Despite these losses, the state’s voters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the U.S.\n                  House of Representatives and the Illinois General Assembly. Boal and Lincoln both\n                  won seats in the Illinois House of Representatives. In late-November 1854, however,\n                  Lincoln declined to serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Boal wrote Lincoln\n                  anotherletteron December 7, 1854 on the subject. Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election to\n                  the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Boal cast his vote for Lincoln on nine ballots before switching to Trumbull\n                  in the final ballot. See the1854 Federal Election.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.
