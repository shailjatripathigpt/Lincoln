He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats.

        "text": "3DemocraticIllinois state Senator James M. Campbell ofMcDonough Countywas concerned with the  political balance in the Illinois General Assembly because\n                  that body was to elect the state’s next U.S. senator in a joint ballot during their\n                  approaching session.After Lincoln resigned his seat in the Illinois House of Representatives, a special\n                  election was held on December 23, 1854 to select a replacement representative forSangamon County. Instead of electing another Whig to replace Lincoln, Sangamon County voters elected\n                  DemocratJonathan McDaniel. McDonough County was also facing a special election for the Illinois House of Representatives\n                  scheduled for Saturday, December 30, 1854. In the regular McDonough County election\n                  for the Illinois House of Representatives in November 1854, WhigLouis H. Watershad defeated his Democratic opponent, John E. Jackson, by a single vote, causing\n                  Jackson to contest the outcome. Campbell was apparently attempting to capitalize on\n                  the Democratic victory in Sangamon County to encourage a similar upset in McDonough\n                  County and increase the chances that the General Assembly would elect apro-NebraskaU.S. senator. Despite Campbell’s efforts, Waters won the seat by nineteen votes in\n                  the special election which seems to have ultimately been held on Monday, January 1,\n                  1855.When the Illinois General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to\n                  elect Illinois’s next U.S. Senator both McDaniel and Waters voted with their respective\n                  party. McDaniel voted forJames Shieldsin the first six rounds of voting, and forJoel A. Mattesonin the final four rounds. Waters switched his allegiance back and forth between Lincoln,Archibald Williams, andOrville H. Browning. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of\n                  contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Trumbull won the Senate\n                  seat on the tenth ballot with the addition of Lincoln’s erstwhile supporters, but\n                  Waters cast his in the tenth round as the sole vote  for Williams, becoming the only\n                  Whig not to unite on Trumbull’s candidacy.

In the case of the U.S. Senate campaign of 1854-55, Douglas worked to gain support\n                  for the Democratic Party by linking opposition to the reelection of Irish-born James\n                  Shields to nativism.Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.

Campbell\n                  broke with his fellow Democrats to vote against the resolutions. Perhaps because of\n                  this, when Lincoln made lists early in 1855 of the political affiliations of the members\n                  of the upcoming Nineteenth General Assembly with an eye towards support for his Senate\n                  candidacy, he described Campbell as an anti-Nebraska Democrat. Local newspapers, however,\n                  reported in December 1854 that Campbell claimed he had approved of the resolutions\n                  of support, but voted as he did because he disagreed with the timing of  their introduction.\n                  In the General Assembly’s joint ballot for U.S. senator on February 8, 1855, Campbell\n                  voted for Shields for the first six rounds and Matteson for the final four, rather\n                  than supporting any of the anti-Nebraska candidates under consideration.Arthur Charles Cole,The Era of the Civil War 1848-1870, vol. 3 ofThe Centennial History of Illinois(Springfield: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1919), 121–22;Weekly Rock Island Republican(IL), 8 March 1854, 2:5;List of Members of the Illinois Legislature in 1855; List of Members of the Illinois Legislature in 1855;The Ottawa Free Trader(IL), 23 December 1854, 2:4; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
