        "text": "2In May 1858, Hay wrote Lincoln two letters. No responses from Lincoln to either letter\n                  have been located.Abraham Lincoln was rarely at home because, throughout the summer and fall of 1858,\n                  he  was canvassingIllinoisdelivering speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. He was the  Illinois Republican Party’s candidate to replaceDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senate. Since members of the Illinois General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the1858 Federal Election.

        "text": "4If Lincoln wrote a response to this letter, it has not been located.Southern Illinois was a Democratic stronghold and northern Illinois was a Republican\n                  stronghold; therefore, Lincoln and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts on\n                  central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest. The only exceptions\n                  were the thirdLincoln-Douglas Debate, which was held inJonesboro, in far southwestern Illinois, and Douglas’s visits toChester,Cairo, andBenton—in west central Illinois,  deep southern Illinois, and central southern Illinois,\n                  respectively. Lincoln did not deliver a public address in Jasper County, Illinois,\n                  or any other county in southern Illinois during the 1858 campaign season. In some\n                  notes he wrote about campaign strategy in 1858, he concluded that the majority of the Illinois\n                  House and Illinois Senate districts in southern Illinois were not, in a political\n                  and strategic sense, worth fighting for.In Illinois’s local elections of 1858, voters elected Democrats as their representatives\n                  in the Illinois Senate and the Illinois House in each county Hay discusses in this\n                  letter with the exception of voters in Illinois’s Eighteenth Senate district, who\n                  elected RepublicanThomas A. Marshallto office. (The Eighteenth Illinois Senate district included Cumberland County at\n                  the time, as well asColes,Edgar, andVermilioncounties.) Edward Kitchell of Olney in Richland County was a candidate for the Illinois\n                  House, but lost to Democrat William J. Stephenson.Republicans ultimately won a majority of all votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas\n                  Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly and Douglas won reelection\n                  to the U.S. Senate. Marshall was the only state representative elected from the counties\n                  that Hay mentions in this letter that voted for Lincoln; all the other representatives\n                  cast their ballots for Douglas. Although Lincoln’s attempt to unseat Douglas was \n                  unsuccessful, his involvement in thecampaign—particularly the Lincoln-Douglas Debates—catapulted him to national prominence.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 219-20, 222;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 November 1858, 2:4;Olney Times(IL), 29 October 1858, 2:2; 6 November 1858, 2:2; Illinois HouseJournal. 1859. 21st G.
