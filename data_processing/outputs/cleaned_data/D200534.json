Before you pay it, it would be well to be sure you have\n\nnot paid it or, at least that you can not prove you have paid it– Give my love toMother, and all the connections– Your request for eighty dollars, I do not think it best to comply with now– At the\n\nvarious times when I\n\nhave helped you a little, you have said to me \"We can get along very well now\" but\n\nin a very short time\n\nI find you in the same difficulty again– Now this can only happen by some defect in\n\nyourconduct– What\n\nthat defect is, I think I know– You are notlazy, and still youareanidler–<Page 2>I doubt whether\n\nsince I saw you, you have done a good whole days work, in any one day– You do not\n\nvery much dislike to\n\nwork; and still you do not work much, merely because it does not seem to you that\n\nyou could get much for\n\nit– This habit of uselessly wasting time, is the whole difficulty, and it is vastly\n\nimportant to you,\n\nand still more so to your^children^that you should break this habit– It is more important to\n\nthem, because they have longer to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they\n\nare in it; easier\n\nthan they can get out after they are in– You are now in need of some ready money; and what I propose is, that you shall go\n\nto work \"tooth and\n\nnails\" for some body who will give you money for it– Let father, and your boys take\n\ncharge of things at\n\nhome— prepare for a crop, and make the crop; and you go to work for the best money\n\nwages, or in\n\ndischarge of any debt you owe, that you can get– And to secure you a fair reward for\n\nyour labor, I now\n\npromise you that for every dollar you will, between this and the first of next May,\n\nget for your own\n\nlabor, either in money, or in your own indebtedness, I will then give you one other\n\ndollar– By this, if\n\nyou hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty\n\ndollars a month\n\nfor your work– In this I do notmeanyou shall go off toStLouis, the lead mines, or the gold mines inCalifornia, but I mean for you to go at it, for the best\n\nwages you<Page 3>can get close to home — inColes county. Now if you will do this you will soon be out\n\nof debt and what is better you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in\n\ndebt again– But if I\n\nshould now clear you out, next year you will be just as deep in as ever– You say you\n\nwould almost give\n\nyour place in Heaven for $70 or $80– Then you value your place in Heaven very cheaply\n\nfor I am sure you\n\ncan^with the offer I make you^get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months work– You\n\nsay if I furnish you the money you will deed me the land; and if you dont pay the\n\nmoney back, you will\n\ndeliver possession— Nonsense! If you cant now livewiththe\n\nland, how will you then live without it? You have always beennd to me; and I do\n\nnot now mean to be unkind to you– On the contrary, if you will but follow my advice\n\nyou will find it\n\nworth more than eight times eighty dollars to you–",

This error prompted Lincoln biographer Albert\n                  J. Beveridge to claim that Lincoln ignored Johnston’s plea for funds.Roy P.
