In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering\n                  speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.

Lincoln and his fellow Republicans sought to prevent\n                  the spread of slavery into federal territories, therefore placing slavery back where\n                  the founders intended it.  This meant fighting against the concept of popular sovereignty.\n                  Lincoln defined popular sovereignty as the right to allow people of a territory to\n                  have slavery if they wanted it, but it did not allow them not to have it if they did\n                  not want it.
