    "full_text": "Fragment of Speech regarding Sectionalism, 1 Sectionalism.2 It is constantly objected toFremont&Dayton, that they are supported by asectionalparty, who, by theirsectionalism, endanger the National Union– This objection, more than all others, causes men, really\n\nopposed to slavery extension, to hesitate– Practically, it is the most difficult objection\n\nwe have to meet–3 For this reason, I now propose to examine it, a little more carefully than I have\n\nheretofore done, or seen^it^done by others–4 First, then, what is thenakedquestion between the parties, respectively represented byBuchananand Fremomont? Simply this: “Shall slaverybe allowed to extend into U.S. teritories,now legallyfree?”5Buchanan says itshall; and Fremont says it shallnot– That is thenakedissue, and thewholeof it– Lay the^respective^platforms side by side; and the difference between them, will be found to amount\n\nto precisely that–6 True, each party charges upon the other,designsmuch beyond what is involved in the issue, as stated; but as these charges can not be fully proved either way, it is probably better to reject them on both sides, and\n\nstick to the naked issue, as it is clearly made up on the record. And now, to restate the question “Shall slaverybe allowedto extend into U.S teritories,now legallyfree? I beg to knowhowoneside of that question is more sectional than the other? Of course I expect to effect<Page 2><Page 3>nothing with the man who makes this charge of sectionalism, without caring whether\n\nit is just or not– But of thecandid,fair, man^who has been puzzled with this charge,^I do ask “how isoneside of this question, moresectional, than the other? I beg of him to consider well, and answer calmly–7 If one side be as sectional as the other, nothing is gained, as to sectionalism, by\n\nchanging sides; so that each must choose sides of the question on some other ground—\n\nas I should think, according, as the one side or the other, shall appear nearest right– If he shall really think slaveryoughtto be extended, let him go to Buchanan; if he think it oughtnotlet go to Fremont– But, Fremont and Dayton, are both residents of the free-states; and this fact has\n\nbeen vaunted, in high places, as excessivesectionalism–8 While interested individuals becomeindignantandexcited, against this manifestation ofsectionalism, I am very happy to know, that the Constitution remains calm— keeps cool— upon the\n\nsubject– It does say that President and Vice President shall be resident of different\n\nstates; but it does not say one must live in aslave, and the other in afreestate–9 It has been acustomto take one from a slave, and the other from a free state; but the custom has not,\n\nat all been uniform– In1828Gen. Jacksonand MrCalhoun, both from slave-states, were placed on the same ticket; and MrAdamsand DrRush10were pitted<Page 4><Page 5>both from the free-states, were pitted against them. Gen. Jackson and MrCalhoun were elected; and qualified and served under the election; yet the whole\n\nthing never suggested the idea of sectionalism– In 1841, the president,Gen. Harrison, died, by which MrTyler, the Vice-President^& aslave stateman,^became president– MrMangum, anotherslave-stateman, was placed in the Vice Presidential chair, served out the term, and no fuss\n\nabout it— no sectionalism thought of–11 In 1853 the presentpresidentcame into office– He is afree-stateman– MrKing, the new Vice President elect, was aslave stateman; but he died without entering on the duties of his office– At first, his vacancy\n\nwas filled byAtchison, anotherslave-stateman; but he soon resigned, and the place was supplied byBright, afree-stateman– So that right now, and for the year and a half last past, our president andvice-presidentare both actually free-state men–12 But, it is said, the friends of Fremont, avow the purpose of electing him exclusively\n\nby free-state votes, and that this is unendurablesectionalism– This statement of fact, is not exactly true– With the friends of Fremont, it is anexpectednecessity, but it is not an “avowedpurpose,” to elect him, if at all, principally, by free state votes; but it is, with equal\n\nintensity, true<Page 6><Page 7>that Buchanan's friends expect to elect him, if at all, chiefly by slave-state votes– Here, again, the sectionalism, is just as much on one side as the other– The thing which gives most color to the charge of Sectionalism, made against those\n\nwho oppose the spread of slavery into free teritory, is the fact thattheycan get no votes in the slave-states, while their opponents get all, or nearly so,\n\nin the slave-states, and also, a large number in the free States– To state it in another\n\nway, the Extensionists, can get votes all over the Nation, while the Restrictionists\n\ncan get them only in the free states– This being the fact,whyis it so? It is not because onesideof the question dividing them, is more sectional than theother; nor because of any difference in the mental or moral structure of the people North\n\nand South– It is because, in that question, the people of the South have an immediate\n\npalpable^and immensely great^pecuniary interest; while,in^with the people of^the North, it is merely an abstract question of moral right, with onlyslight, andremotepecuniary interest added– The slaves of the South, at a moderate estimate, are worth a thousand millions of\n\ndollars–13Let it be permanently settled that this property may extend to new teritory, without restraint, and it greatlyenhances, perhaps quitedoubles, its value at once– This immense, palpable pecuniary interest, on the question of\n\nextending slavery, unites the Southern people,asas one man– But it can not be demonstrated that theNorthwill gain a dollar by restricting it– Moral principle is all, or nearly all, that unites us of the North– Pity ’tis, it is so, but this is a looser bond, than pecuniary interest. Right here is the plain cause oftheirperfectunion andourwantof it–^And see how it works–^If a Southern man aspires to be president, they choke him down instantly, in order\n\nthat the glittering prize of the presidency, may be held up, on Southern terms, to\n\nthe greedy eyes of Northern ambition– With this they tempt us, and break in upon us– Thedemocratic party, in1844, elected a Southernpresident– Since then, they have neither had a^Southern^candidate forelection, ornomination– Their Conventions of 1848–1852and1856, have been struggles exclusively amongNorthernmen, each vieing to outbid the other for the Southern vote— the South standingacalmly by to finallysay^cry^going, going, gone, to the highest bidder; and, at the same time, to make its power\n\nmore distinctly seen, and thereby to secure a still higher bid at the next succeeding\n\nstruggle–14 “Actions speak louder than words” is the maxim; and, if true, the South now distinctly\n\nsays to the North “Give us themeasures, and you take themen” The total withdrawal of Southern aspirants,^for the presidency,^multiplies the number of Northern ones– These last, in competing with each other,\n\ncommit themselves to the utmost verge that, through their own greediness, they have\n\nthe least hope their Northern supporters will bear,– Having got committed, in a race\n\nof competetion, necessity drives them into union to sustain themselves. Each, at first secures all\n\nhe can, on personal attach-<Page 12><Page 13>ments to him, and throughhopesresting on him personally– Next, they unite with one another, and with the perfectly\n\nbanded South, to make the offensive position they have got into, “a party measure”–\n\nThis done, large additional numbers are secured– When the repeal of theMissouri Compromisewas first proposed, at the North there was litterally “nobody” in favor of it– In February 1854 ourLegislaturemet in call- or extra, session– From themDouglassought an indorsement of his then pending measure of Repeal–InIn our Legislature were about 70 democrats to 30whigs– Theformerheld a caucus, in which it was resolved to give Douglas the desired indorsement– Some of the members of that caucus bolted— would not stand it— and they now divulge\n\nthe secrets– They say that the caucus fairly confessed that the Repeal was wrong;\n\nand they placed their determination to indorse it, solely on the ground that it wasnecessaryto sustain Douglas– Here we have the direct evidence of how theNebraska-billobtained it’s strength inIllinois– It was given, not in a sense of right, but in the teeth of a sense of wrong, tosustain Douglas–15So Illinois was divided– SoNew England, forPierce;MichiganforCass,andPensylvaniafor Buchan, and all for the Democratic party– And when, by such means, they have got a large portion of the Northern people into\n\na position contrary to their own honest impulses, and sense of right; they have the\n\nimpudence<Page 14><Page 15>to turn upon those who do stand firm, and call themsectional– Were it not too serious a matter, this cool impudence would be laughable, to say the\n\nleast– Recurring to the question \"Shallslaverybeallowed to extend into U.S. teritorynow legalfree? Thisisa sectional question— that is to say, it is a question, in its nature calculated\n\nto divide the American people geographically– Who is toblamefor that?whocan help it? Either sidecanhelp it; but how? Simply byyieldingto the other side– There is no other way– In the whole range ofpossibility, there is no other way– Then, which side shall yield? To this again, there can be\n\nbut one answer— the side which is in thewrong– True, we differ, as to which sideiswrong; and we boldly say, let all who really think slavery ought to spread into free\n\nteritory, openly go over against us– There is where they rightfully belong– But why should any go, who really think slavery ought not to spread? Do they really\n\nthink therightought to yield to thewrong? Are they afraid to stand by theright? Do they fear that the constitution is too weak to sustain them in the right? Do\n\nthey really think that by right surrendering to wrong, the hopes of our constitution,\n\nour Union, and our liberties, can possibly be bettered?",

He was aiming\n                  for additional support for John C. Fremont in thepresidential election of 1856.

The U.S.\n                  Constitution was ambiguous over presidential succession, and the judiciary had never\n                  issued an official pronouncement on the issue. Article two, section one of the Constitution\n                  stated that upon the death of a president, the duties and powers of the office devolved\n                  upon the vice president, so Vice President John Tyler assumed the office of the president.\n                  Tyler’s ascendancy to the presidency left the vice-presidency vacant, leaving the\n                  U.S. Senate without a president.
