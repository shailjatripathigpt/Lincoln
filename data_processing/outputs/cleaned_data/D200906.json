Although he\n                  had declined other requests to speak outside Illinois during the 1856 campaign, Lincoln\n                  delivered anaddressin Kalamazoo on August 27. He was the only person from outsideMichiganto speak at the event.Ultimately, the Republican Party in Illinois failed to win the support of American\n                  Party voters, and Buchanan won the presidency. In Illinois, Buchanan won 44.1 percent\n                  of the vote to Republican Party candidate John C. Fremont’s 40.2 percent and American\n                  Party candidate Millard Fillmore’s 15.7 percent.  See the1856 Federal Election.Abraham Lincoln to James W. Grimes;Abraham Lincoln to Joel B.
