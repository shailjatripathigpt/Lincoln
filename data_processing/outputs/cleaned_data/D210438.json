Associated with a single rattlesnake, use of the phrase and the rattlesnake image\n                  became so widespread that its exact origin is unknown.  It is most often connected\n                  with the Gadsden Flag, which South Carolinian Christopher Gadsden designed in 1775\n                  for the Continental Navy.  Gadsden’s flag had a yellow background with a rattlesnake\n                  coiled in the middle and with the motto underneath.David Hackett Fischer,Liberty and Freedom(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 77-78."
