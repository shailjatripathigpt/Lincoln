        "text": "3Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, dated this bill by the date that it was first introduced in theIllinois Senate—February 5, 1853. TheLincoln Logclaims that the bill was written February 4, 1853. As he noted in a February 15,\n                  1853letterto John A. Rockwell, Lincoln was busy in court when Rockwell’s request to write the\n                  bill reached him. Rockwell’s letter to Lincoln making this request has not been located,\n                  and it is unclear when Lincoln received it. However, Lincoln was busy with work on\n                  various legal cases from at least January 25-29, 1853 and from February 1-3, 1853.\n                  Therefore, he most likely wrote this bill either January 30, January 31, or February\n                  4, 1853.Asahel Gridleyintroduced the bill in the Illinois Senate on February 5, 1853.  The Senate referred\n                  the bill to its Committee on Incorporations. On February 9, the committee reported\n                  back the bill with amendments, to which the Senate concurred. It passed the bill as\n                  amended, then referred it to theIllinois House of Representativesfor consideration.On February 10, 1853, the House was informed of the Senate’s passage of the bill,\n                  but no further action was taken before the House session ended. In hisletterto Rockwell, Lincoln promised to get the bill passed “at the next Session.” However,\n                  the bill did not come before theIllinois General Assemblyagain until 1857.On January 15, 1857,Burton C. Cookreintroduced the bill in the Senate, under the revised title “An Act to Incorporate\n                  the Big Vermilion Coal Company.” The Senate referred the bill to its Committee on\n                  Banks and Corporations. On January 17, the committee reported back the bill without\n                  amendment and recommended its passage. The Senate passed it and sent it to the House\n                  for consideration.The House took up the bill on January 21 and referred it to its Committee on Banks\n                  and Corporations. On January 23, the committee reported back  the bill without amendment\n                  and recommended its passage.  On February 12, the House passed it and informed the\n                  Senate. The bill was signed into law under its new title in February 1857.The 1857 law differed from Lincoln’s 1853 bill in several ways. First, Rockwell was\n                  no longer associated with it. The law instead named Orville N. Adams, James C. Brown,\n                  David Evans, James Strain, and their associates as constituting the company, and specified\n                  that Adams was empowered to organize it. The law also did not specify the land or\n                  lands to be mined other than to note that they were owned by Adams, Brown, Evans,\n                  and Strain. Finally, the law awarded the incorporation for a term of 100 years and\n                  authorized the company to engage in the transportation of mineral products—including\n                  via boat—but made no mention of the construction of any railroad.Roy P.
