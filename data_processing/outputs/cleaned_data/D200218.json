A history ofSangamon Countypublished in 1881, however, had a Joseph Whitney serving in 1839, andJonas Whitneyas serving  in 1840.  Seeing that he was a large land owner in Sangamon and surrounding\n                  counties, Jonas seems most likely to have been on the board both in 1839 and 1840.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 10 April 1840, 2:1;Proceedings of the Springfield Board of Trustees;History of Sangamon County, Illinois(Chicago: Inter-State, 1881), 565."
