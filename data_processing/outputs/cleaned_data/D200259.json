In February 1839, the General Assembly\n                  enacted anotherlaw, as thePanic of 1837enveloped thestate, stipulating that if the state owed the State Bank of Illinois more than $10,000,\n                  the auditor of public accounts was to  issue, upon the return of warrants by the bank,\n                  certificates in favor of the bank for payment of the balance due.  These certificates\n                  were to bear six percent interest annually from the time of issuance to payment. On\n                  December 23, 1840,William J. Gatewoodfrom the Senate Committee on Finance, to which theSenatehad referred a resolution regarding the deposit of public money in the State Bank\n                  of Illinois, introduced a bill in the Senate that would have repealed the1837and1839acts and authorized the state treasurer and auditor of public accounts to neither\n                  deposit public money in the State Bank or draw warrants on public money in the Bank.\n                  The Senate passed thebillon January 5, 1841. On January 15, the House of Representatives referred thebillto the Committee on the Judiciary. The Committee on the Judiciary reported back thebillon January 23 with amendments, in which the House concurred.  On February 11, the\n                  House again took up thebill. After a lengthy debate, The House refused to vote on thebillas amended by a vote of 42 yeas to 43 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.Illinois SenateJournal. 1840. 12th G.

        "text": "2Section twenty-five of the bank’sincorporation actstipulated that if the bank refused or neglected to redeem, for ten days after demand,\n                  its notes or evidence of debt in specie, the bank would discontinue operations and\n                  its charter would be forfeited.  Anact supplementaryto the incorporation act gave the bank an additional fifty days to suspend specie\n                  payments. Under provisions of the incorporation act and an act supplementary thereto,\n                  if the bank did not resume specie payments within sixty days after suspension, it\n                  would lose its charter. In May 1837, the bank suspended specie payments in response\n                  to the Panic of 1837.  In July, a special session of the legislature commenced to\n                  deal with the banking crisis.  On July 21, the General Assembly passed anactsuspending until the end of the next general or special session of the legislature\n                  provisions of the law requiring the bank to forfeit its charter for refusing to redeem\n                  its notes in specie for sixty days.  In December 1839, the state’s debt crisis forced\n                  the bank to again suspend specie payments.  GovernorThomas Carlincalled the legislature into special session to deal with the crisis.  In hismessageto the General Assembly,  Carlin attacked the bank and demanded an investigation\n                  of its affairs.  The legislators complied by establishing a joint select committee.\n                  Despite Carlin’s hostility, the legislature  passed anacton January 31, 1840, resuscitating the bank with, as Lincoln described in alettertoJohn T. Stuart, “some trifling modifications.”  The act revived the bank’s charter and suspending\n                  stipulations on specie payments until the end of the next legislative session. On\n                  December 5, 1840,  the Whigs, hoping to protect the bank againstDemocratdemands that it resume specie payments by the end of the special session or forfeit\n                  its charter, boycotted the General Assembly, thereby preventing the necessary two-thirds\n                  quorum for adjournmentsine die.  When the situation became acute, Abraham Lincoln,Joseph Gillespie, andAsahel Gridley, occupying their seats  as a token representation of Whigs for procedural votes,\n                  exited the House chamber through windows to prevent a quorum and frustrate plans of\n                  the Democrats.Illinois HouseJournal. 1839. 11th G.

As the Senate was deliberating\n                  thisbill, the House of Representatives was considering anotherbill, which was similar in content.
