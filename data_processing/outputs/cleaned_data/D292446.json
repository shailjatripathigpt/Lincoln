        "text": "5Despite his concerns, Lincoln pursued a plan for fusion.  In September 1856, he wrote\n                  to several of his connections asking for the names of Fillmore supporters. He then\n                  sent lithographed form letters to the names provided. The form letters informed the\n                  Fillmore supporters that every vote for their candidate in Illinois lessened his chance\n                  of becoming president.Lincoln and his fellow Republicans failed to convince Fillmore’s supporters to unite,\n                  allowing Democrats  to label their opponents as both nativists and worshippers of\n                  African Americans.  Lincoln’s prediction proved prophetic: Buchanan captured Illinois\n                  with 44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont and 15.7 for Fillmore, and\n                  Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore to become fifteenth president of the United\n                  States. Indeed, if the votes received by Fremont and Fillmore in Illinois had been\n                  combined, Buchanan’s vote would not have been sufficient to carry the state.
