        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Talcott of December 6, 1854, has not been located, but\n                  was likely similar to others he wrote around that time requesting his allies’ help\n                  in canvassing theirIllinois General Assemblymembers for support of his potential candidacy for a seat in the U.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.

        "text": "3Thomas B. Talcott’s brother, Wait Talcott, had recently been elected state senator\n                  forBoone,Carroll,Ogle, andWinnebagocounties as a fusion candidate. Fusion tickets became common during the1854 electionas disaffected Whigs and Democrats banded together withFree Soilers,Nativists, and temperance advocates. Many Whigs also fused with Democrats who shared their\n                  distaste for the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the extension of slavery. In Illinois’s First\n                  Congressional District, the fusion ticket was formed by Democrats, Whigs, and Free\n                  Soilers who held a district-wide anti-Nebraska convention inRockfordon August 30, 1854, at which they crafted a platform that called for the repeal of\n                  the Kansas-Nebraska Act and theFugitive Slave Lawand for a limit to the expansion of slavery. Convention attendees also resolved to\n                  call themselvesRepublicans. Wait Talcott served as vice president for Winnebago County at this convention. Following\n                  his November 1854 election as state senator, Talcott was listed in newspaper election\n                  returns for Winnebago County as a fusion candidate, while his opponent was described\n                  as a Whig or independent. “Abolitionist of the Lovejoy stamp” suggests that Wait held\n                  similar views to the Lovejoy brothers, Elijah P., Joseph C., and Owen Lovejoy.The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate.  Wait Talcott voted for Lincoln through the first six rounds\n                  of balloting. He did not vote in the seventh round, but in the eighth round voted\n                  forWilliam B. Ogdenbefore switching his vote to anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullin the ninth vote. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln\n                  dropped out of contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for Trumbull\n                  to ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Talcott voted for Trumbull\n                  again in the tenth round of voting, at which point Trumbull won a majority of votes\n                  and was elected Illinois’ next senator.Neither Owen Lovejoy nor Ichabod Codding were nominated for senator in the election\n                  held in the joint General Assembly session in February 1855. Lovejoy was himself a\n                  member of the Illinois House of Representatives at that session.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac, 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 219, 221; Michael F.
