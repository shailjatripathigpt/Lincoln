        "text": "2The letters of December 15, 1854 and March 5, 1855 have not been located. Sandford,\n                  Porter, and Striker sent Lincoln a $2,000 bond for collection.  Samuel A. Clift had\n                  made a bond with one Mr. Pray’s for $2,000.  Clift had failed to pay the bond, and\n                  Pray had commenced an attachment suit to collect the debt.   Attachment involved a\n                  legal action through which a plaintiff could have the court seize the defendant’s\n                  personal or real property pending the outcome of a case involving a debt of $20 or\n                  more; creditors frequently used attachment against debtors.  Although both Clift and\n                  Pray were residents ofNew York, Clift had a 330-acre farm one mile from Rushville, out of which Pray, in his attachment\n                  suit, wished the collection be made.Abraham Lincoln to Henry Dummer; “Attachment” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

        "text": "3Lincoln had failed to collect the debt and had neglected other legal business because\n                  he was occupied with an unsuccessful bid to becomeIllinois’ next U.S. Senator.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened his Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into theelection campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, his name\n                  began to circulate as a possible candidate for U.S. Senator. Although he won election\n                  to theIllinois House of Representatives, on November 25, 1854 he officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for theU.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, however,\n                  Lincoln did not win election to the U.S. Senate; on February 8, 1855 the General Assembly\n                  selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
