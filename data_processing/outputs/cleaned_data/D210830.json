        "text": "2William H. Herndon responded to Grigsby on behalf of Lincoln & Herndon on July 29,\n                  1858, stating that the office was full, but that Grigsby would be welcome as a student\n                  if a position opened. Abraham Lincoln alsowroteGrigsby on August 3, when Grigsby simultaneously wrote this letter. Lincoln advised\n                  Grigsby that he would become a lawyer more quickly by studying on his own. In an 1861\n                  letter to Lincoln, Grigsby mentioned that he came to Springfield in the autumn of 1858 hoping\n                  to speak with either Lincoln or Herndon, but that neither was in town. Herndon wrote\n                  Grigsby a further letter on April 23, 1859, in response to another unlocated letter\n                  from the hopeful student, in which he reiterated that the office was full and had\n                  no room for an additional law student. The two letters to Grigsby in Herndon’s hand\n                  on behalf of Lincoln & Herndon are docketed by Grigsby at head of text with notes\n                  that appear to be addressed to Lincoln and which narrate the history of his correspondence\n                  with the firm. This suggests that Grigsby may have at some time enclosed or intended\n                  to enclose Herndon’s correspondence in a letter to Lincoln, but no such covering letter\n                  has been identified.Letter, Document ID: 124908; Letter, Document ID: 131067,Lincoln & Herndon declined Grigsby as legal apprentice, Martha L.

        "text": "3Grigsby’s quoted phrases appear to be allusions to the Bible. For example, a version\n                  of the phrase “verily ye shall not lose your reward” is found in Mark 9:41 as “For\n                  truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong\n                  to Christ will by no means lose his reward.” “Glad tidings” of salvation, redemption,\n                  and great joy are found throughout the Bible, examples including Psalms XLV, Colossians\n                  II, and John IV. The phrase “and the praise shall be thine” is seen in a reflection\n                  on final line of John 7:1-27, “...we may all at last come, in the unity of the faith,\n                  in the bond of love, to serve thee in thy kingdom of glory, and the praise shall be\n                  thine forever, throughJesus Christ, our strength  and our Redeemer.”Family Worship.

        "text": "4Grigsby continues to allude to Bible verses. The wilderness of Sin references a location\n                  between Elim and \tSinai where the Israelites rested during their exodus. The \"lamp\n                  of Human Rights\" may be based upon Proverbs, “The human spirit is the lamp of the\n                  LORD that sheds light on one’s inmost being.” Grigsby’s reference to the fatal cup’s\n                  dregs may be his refusal to give up on his goal of studying law. The \"fatal cupsdregs\" alludes to the cup of God's fury and judgment in Psalm 75 and Isaiah 51. \n                  Similarly, Jesus references the cup of God's anger and wrath in his prayer in the\n                  Garden of Gethsemane as recorded in three of the four Synoptic Gospels.Exodus 16:1; Psalms 75:8; Proverbs 20:27; Isaiah 51:17, 22; Matthew 26:36-46; Mark\n                     14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46 ."

When David expressed outrage at the\n                  actions of the rich man, Nathan used this phrase to point out that David had committed\n                  a similar crime by killing Bathsheba’s husband so that he could marry her himself.2 Samuel 12:1-10."
