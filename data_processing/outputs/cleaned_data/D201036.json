        "text": "3Although no additional correspondence between Lincoln and Whitney regarding this matter\n                  has been located after this June 24 letter, they exchanged at least eight more letters\n                  related to theelection of 1858.In this letter, Lincoln is discussing charges that the editors of theDaily Chicago Timesmade regarding his actions in theU.S. House of Representativesrelated to a bill providing for supplies for U.S. military personnel serving in\n                  theMexican War. The editors claimed that Lincoln, whom theRepublican Partyhad recently nominated as their candidate for theU.S. Senate,  voted against the bill in an effort to deny food, clothing, medicine, and medical\n                  care to U.S. soldiers and officers serving at the front. This was not true. Although\n                  Lincoln opposed the Mexican War and questioned its constitutionality during his time\n                  in the U.S. House, he nevertheless voted in favor of supplies for U.S. troops on at\n                  least two occasions: February 17, 1848 and March 8, 1848. In both instances, the bills\n                  Lincoln voted for passed the U.S. Senate and became law, funneling aid in the form\n                  of money, food, clothing, medical supplies, and the like to U.S. military personnel\n                  serving in Mexico.Joseph MedillandJohn L. Scrippsalso wrote to Lincoln to inform him of theDaily Chicago Times' attacks on his congressional record related to the Mexican War and asked Lincoln\n                  for a response. Lincolnrepliedto Medill on June 25, asserting that he never \"gave any vote for withholding any\n                  supplies whatever, from officers or soldiers of the Mexican war.\" Despite publication\n                  of the facts surrounding Lincoln's voting record in the U.S. House in theIllinoispress as early as June 25, 1858—including by  Democratic newspapers,Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln's opponent for the U.S. Senate,  repeated theDaily Chicago Times' claims during the election campaign of 1858. In speeches he delivered during the\n                  campaign, including during theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln repeatedly refuted the charges and cited congressional records to back up\n                  his voting record in the U.S. House.In the end, Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however,\n                  and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln\n                  gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Daily Chicago Times(IL), 23 June 1858, 2:1-2;Henry C.
