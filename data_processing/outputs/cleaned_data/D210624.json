He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S.\n                  Senate seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate.

In a December 22letterto Lincoln, Swett noted that he visited several men who lived in both Will andLa Sallecounties.

Both Strunk and Gavion D. A. Parks cast their votes for Lincoln for six\n                  ballots, then Strunk switched his vote toJoel A. Matteson. Parks switched his vote to Trumbull on the eighth ballot. Alanson K. Wheeler voted\n                  for Lincoln for eight ballots, then switched his vote to Trumbull. See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;Leonard Swett to Abraham Lincoln;Leonard Swett to Abraham Lincoln;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;David Davis to Abraham Lincoln; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:401-2; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
