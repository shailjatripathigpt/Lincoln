        "text": "2Hesing,Henry Wendt, andAnthony Fischercomprised the festival committee for the Fourth of July celebration of Chicago’s\n                  German-Americans, which was held on Monday, July 5, 1858, and raised funds to benefit\n                  the German Aid Society. In addition to speeches in English and German, the event featured\n                  gymnastics and games.As part of the festivities, the German Republicans of Chicago’s Seventh Ward were\n                  presented a banner in recognition of their efforts in securing victory in the March\n                  2, 1858, Chicago municipal election for the Republican Party. Samuel L. Baker having\n                  been detained by business inNew York,Charles L. Wilsonread a letter from him and presented the banner on his behalf. In the latter half\n                  of the 1850s, the Seventh Ward of Chicago was referred to as the “Bloody Seventh”\n                  due to the political clashes between Irish residents who supported theDemocratic Partyand German residents who increasingly supported the Republican Party. The outcome\n                  of the 1858 Chicago municipal election was that the entire Republican ticket was elected.\n                  In addition, following the election the Chicago city marshall, city clerk, and five\n                  aldermen were all of German origin, and the Germans of the Seventh Ward were celebrated\n                  for their role in the Republican victory. While in the 1856 mayoral election the Seventh\n                  Ward had given a 790-vote margin of victory to DemocratThomas Dyer, in the 1858 mayoral race the ward gave Republican victorJohn C. Hainesa 158-vote advantage. The ward was lauded by theChicago Tribune, which wrote that it had “been redeemed, regenerated and disenthralled! The great\n                  Irish citadel has been stormed–the black flag of Ruffianism has been hauled down,\n                  and the bright banner of Freedom waves in glorious triumph.”In its coverage of the 1858 Chicago municipal election, theDaily Chicago Tribunereferred to Democrats and the Democratic Party as “Border Ruffians” and “Border Ruffianism”\n                  in reference to the skirmishes along the border ofMissouriandKansas Territoryduring the events of “Bleeding Kansas”.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 2 July 1858, 1:2; 7 July 1858, 1:3-4; Raymond Lohne, “‘Five Times as Enthusiastic’:\n                     Abraham Lincoln and the Bloody Seventh of Chicago,”Yearbook of German-American Studies50 (2015), 105-28; Christina Bearden-White, “Illinois Germans and the Coming of the\n                     Civil War: Reshaping Ethnic Identity,”Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society109 (Fall 2016), 236-37;Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 1 March 1858, 1:1-2; 3 March 1858, 1:1-2; 4 March 1858, 1:2; 5 March 1858,\n                     2:1; 6 March 1858, 1:3; 11 March 1858, 2:1;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 4 March 1858, 3:1."
