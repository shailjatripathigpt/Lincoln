In his speech,Taylortook credit for the prosperity ofSangamon Countyduring his time in thestate legislaturefrom 1830 to 1836, and he boasted that he wished to return to the legislature to\n                  bring the county out of the economic difficulty it has suffered since he had left\n                  office. In his response,William L. Mayattacked Taylor’s “vanity and egotism” and, according to theWhig newspaper, left Taylor in tears.  In thestate election,Edward D. Bakerwould defeat Taylor by a narrow margin, 2600 votes to 2009 votes.  In the contest\n                  for representatives, the Whigs would win all five seats.Theodore C.
