Hendersonmet Lincoln in Kewanee, Illinois, on October 27 and escorted him to the Virginia Hotel inToulon. Lincoln spoke in the town square that afternoon. Douglas spoke in Toulon the previous\n                  day.Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate from Illinois for theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  In local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but Pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection.
