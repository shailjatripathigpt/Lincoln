At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted were those who had moved into the\n                  American Party following the dissolution of the Whig Party.TheIllinois State Journalof the day after this letter published the schedule of the upcomingLincoln-Douglas Debates, as well as a list of Lincoln’s speaking appointments between August 12 and September\n                  13, 1858, including his scheduled speech in Carlinville.Lincoln traveled to Carlinville by train on August 31 and gave a speech in the afternoon,\n                  followed by a speech by Palmer himself.Macoupin County ultimately electedDemocratsto the Illinois General Assembly in 1858.

Burke,Republicanor opposition candidate John I. Rinaker, and American Party or independent candidate\n                  Henry Fishback.
