At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the former Whig stronghold\n                  of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest. In local\n                  elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but Pro-Douglas Democrats retained\n                  control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection.

        "text": "3In his “House Divided” speech of June 16, 1858, Lincoln had charged Douglas with working\n                  to nationalize slavery.  In a speech at Beardstown on August 11, Douglas denied this\n                  charge, calling it, according to the crowd at Lincoln ‘sBeardstown speech, “an infamous lie.”  In his Beardstown speech, Lincoln focused on renewing his charge\n                  against Douglas of conspiring to nationalize slavery. He emphasized Douglas’s refusal\n                  to deny the evidence Lincoln presented and insisted that he would continue to charge\n                  Douglas with conspiracy. Lincoln’s evidence included Douglas helping to vote down\n                  a clause in the early version of the Kansas-Nebraska bill that would have given the\n                  people of the territories the right to exclude slavery if they chose.  Lincoln also\n                  cited Douglas’s Senate report of  March 12, 1856, in which he proposed denying territories\n                  the right to exclude slavery until they became a state.Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided: Speech at Springfield, Illinois; U.S. SenateJournal. 1856. 34th Cong., 1st sess., Rep. com., no. 34, 39; U.S. SenateJournal. 1856. 34th Cong., 1st sess., 408-9."

        "text": "4In his July 9 speech inChicago, Douglas accused Lincoln of fomenting a sectional war to achieve political and social\n                  equality between whites and blacks.  Douglas disavowed racial equality, declaring,\n                  “this government was made by the white man, for the benefit of the white man, to be\n                  administered by white men... I am opposed to negro equality.” This ran in opposition\n                  to Lincoln, according to Douglas, who wanted to afford  “the negro of the privileges,\n                  immunities and rights of citizenship.” Douglas then detailed the rights that only\n                  white men should hold, including the right to vote, hold office, or serve on a jury.\n                  In his response to Douglas in Chicago on July 10, Lincoln denied Douglas’s charge,\n                  arguing “against that counterfeit logic which presumes I because I did not want a\n                  negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her for a wife.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 468;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 10 July 1858, 1:4; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois."
