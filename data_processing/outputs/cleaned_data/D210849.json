        "text": "6John Durham ran unsuccessfully for the Illinois Senate in1856in the Seventeenth Illinois Senate District, which includedCass,Logan,Mason,Menard, and Tazewell counties. DemocratSamuel W. Fullerwon the race with 4,814 votes, Durham came in second with 4,488 votes, and Richard\n                  N. Cullom garnered 195 votes. Durham and Cullom were both Whigs who ultimately became\n                  Republicans, but no record of a party nomination for either in the election of 1856\n                  has been located. It seems probable that Durham ran as a candidate of the American\n                  Party, and Cullom as a Republican since Durham acted as a presidential elector for\n                  American Party candidateMillard Fillmorein that year and Cullom supported Republican presidential nomineeJohn C. Fremont. The 1856 election returns from Cass County seem to support this conclusion. These\n                  returns list the candidates, unnamed, by party, with a Democratic candidate who is\n                  presumably Fuller, a Republican candidate who received no votes in that county, and\n                  an American Party candidate, apparently Durham, who received 704 votes in the county,\n                  well over Cullom’s total for the entire district. Lincoln was himself a presidential\n                  elector for Fremont in 1856, and actively campaigned on Fremont’s behalf, focusing\n                  especially on winning over disaffected former Whigs.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968, 219, 221; Lawrence B.

John Durham was one such acquaintance who  Lincoln\n                  reportedly inquired after for this purpose when he arrived inPeoriato speak during the campaign, likely during his visit of August 18 and 19, 1858.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 4 October 1856,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-10-04; 18 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-18; 19 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-19; Jeriah Bonham,Fifty Years’ Recollections with Observations and Reflections on Historical Events\n                        Giving Sketches of Eminent Citizens—Their Lives and Public Services(Peoria, IL: J.

Without consideration, an agreement is unenforceable.In March of 1856 Parker had given Gridley two notes; one note was made out to the\n                  Illinois Central Railroad Company for $300 in exchange for the tract of land that\n                  Parker was then purchasing, and the second note was made out to Gridley for $300.\n                  Parker claimed that his understanding was that this note to Gridley was also made\n                  in consideration for the purchase of the land, as he understood Gridley to be an agent\n                  of the railroad. Gridley maintained that he had not claimed to be an agent of the\n                  railroad, but was instead acting on behalf of Parker and that the $300 note from Parker\n                  to him represented his commission for handling the transaction.Lincoln provided legal opinion to Parker, Martha L.
