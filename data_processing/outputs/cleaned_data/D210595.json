He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  The state’s voters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  in which Lincoln also won a seat. However, in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln did not win election\n                  to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.  See1854 Federal Election.Lincoln and Washburne carried on an extensive correspondence during the senatorial\n                  campaign and exchanged numerous letters related to Lincoln’s candidacy for the U.S.\n                  Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.
