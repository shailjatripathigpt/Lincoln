ScrippsandHenry C. Whitneyalso wrote Lincoln informing him of theDaily Chicago Times’ attacks on his congressional record related to the Mexican War  and asked him to\n                  supply a response. Lincolnrepliedto Whitney on June 24, but no reply to the letter from Scripps has been located.\n                  Lincoln corresponded with Medill several more times after this letter regarding various\n                  aspects of theelection campaign of 1858.Medill’sChicago Daily Tribunepublished a general defense of Lincoln in its June 24 edition, while also admitting\n                  that the editors did not then know whether Lincoln “did or not vote against that war.”\n                  The paper published a thorough refutation of theDaily Chicago Times’ attack upon Lincoln in its June 26 issue. Despite publication of the facts surrounding\n                  Lincoln's voting record in the U.S. House in the Illinois press as early as June 25,\n                  1858—including by Democratic newspapers—Douglas repeated theDaily Chicago Times' claims throughout the election campaign of 1858. In speeches he delivered during\n                  the campaign, including during theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln repeatedly refuted the charges and cited congressional records to back up\n                  his voting record in the U.S. House.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and, in the1858 Federal Election, Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through\n                  his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well\n                  as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:458, 526-28, 554-56;John L.
