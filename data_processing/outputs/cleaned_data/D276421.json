        "text": "5At the outbreak of theBlack Hawk War, Lincoln volunteered for theIllinois State Militia. On April 21, 1832, Lincoln and other men from theNew Salemarea were mustered into a company in the4th Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers, and the members of the company elected Lincoln as their captain. When his month\n                  of service ended, Lincoln re-enlisted twice, for twenty and thirty days respectively,\n                  serving as a private both times. He was finally discharged on July 10, 1832.On September 28, 1850, theU.S. Congresspassed an act granting certain groups who had served in the United States military\n                  during theWar of 1812, any of “the Indian wars” since 1790, and theMexican Warparcels of public land. Per this act, the amount of land that veterans (or their\n                  legal heirs) were entitled to depended upon the length of engagement and actual time\n                  served. As his land warrant and this certification demonstrate, Lincoln was entitled\n                  to forty acres of public land for the time he served as captain of the Fourth Regiment\n                  of Illinois Mounted Volunteers. After his land warrant was certified by the land office\n                  in Iowa and filed with the U.S. General Land Office inWashington, DC,  a patent for land inTama County, Iowawas issued to him.Lincoln  eventually received another 120 acres of land for his service during the\n                  Black Hawk War after a federal law passed in 1855 declared that all who had served\n                  in any U.S. war since 1790 were entitled to 160 acres of land in total. This 120 acres\n                  of additional land Lincoln received was located in Crawford County, Iowa, 144 miles\n                  west of the forty acres he held in Tama County. There is no evidence that Lincoln\n                  ever received any revenue from any of these bounty lands. After his assassination,\n                  since he did not leave a will, the forty acres of Tama County land passed in one-third\n                  equal divisions toMary Lincoln,Robert T. Lincoln, andThomas “Tad” Lincoln. The Crawford County land also passed to the remaining Lincoln family.Muster Roll of Abraham Lincoln’s Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Captain Elijah Iles’ Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Captain Jacob M.
