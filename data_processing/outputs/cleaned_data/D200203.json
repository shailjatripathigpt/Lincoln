It will be recollected, that, during the session of 1836-7, a joint select committee\n\nwas appointed by the\n\nLegislature of Illinois, to examine into the condition of the State Bank, with a view\n\nof ascertaining,\n\namong other things, whether said said institution would constitute a safe depository for the funds of the\n\nState—4 On the 18thday of February 1837, that committee submitted a\n\nreport to theHouse of Representatives, and about the same time a report was also submitted to the\n\nSenate, which reports occupied most of the ground, from the organization of the Bank\n\nin 1835 to the then present time— Yourcommittee^The undersigned^deemed it an act of\n\ninutility, not\n\nto say of supererogation, to re-investigate and\n\nre-examine the same charges, examined and reported upon by the former committee: and\n\nhave therefore\n\ndirected their attention more particularly to the actings and doings of the Bank since\n\nFebruary 1837. After a labourus and attentive investigation, theCommittee^undersigned^have prepared the following report, which they beg leave to submit— Asyour Committee^the undersigned^believed, that the Legislature wished information, to enlighten their\n\njudgment; and to assist them in coming to a conclusion, as to the propriety of renewing\n\nthe forfeited\n\ncharter of the Bank, they deemed it not improper to bestow\n\nmost of their attention upon the following inquiries– 1. Whether there had been any circumstances of mismanagement of the affairs of the\n\nBank, or mal-practices\n\non the part of her officers, or any of them, against which future legislation might guard, or which would render the institution unworthy of\n\npublic confidence? 2. Whether the stock in said Bank,ownedowned by thestate, is safe: and, whether the interest of the State, and the interests of the\n\npeople, would be consulted, by a renewal of the charter of\n\nthe Bank? On the first ground, By5reference to theanswer of thethe joint resolution of both houses, it will be seen, that the first inquiry\n\nis, \"whether the Bank has forfeited its charter?\" The 25thsection of thecharter, as amended,\n\nprovides—That if the Bank shall, for sixty days after demand, neglect or refuse to\n\npay its\n\nevidences of debt in specie, it shall forthwith close all its business, except the\n\ncollecting and\n\nsecuring its debts, and the charter shall be forfeited. More than sixty days have elapsed, since the Bank announced that it had suspended\n\nspecie payments, and,\n\nas applications for the specie redemption of its liabilities have doubtless since\n\nbeen made and refused,\n\nthecommittee^undersigned^have no doubt, that the charter of the Bank would be declared forfeited by the\n\nproper court, on proof of such demand and refusal— The forfeiture, they believe, would\n\ndate^on the sixtieth day^from the day of refusal— The charter, therefore, although not yet\n\nadjudicated upon, must certainly be forfeited, when the subject is brought before\n\nthe proper tribunal—6 The next inquiry, which the committee is directed to make, is—\"What rates, of the\n\ndiscounts of the\n\nBank, have been to persons living out of the State?\" The examination of the Statements of the Bank has produced in our minds some\n\nsurprize, at the smallness of the business, which the Bank has done with non-residents—\n\nThe amount, now\n\ndue the Bank, on loans and discounts to non residents, amounts to but 4 per cent of\n\nthe whole sum of the\n\ndebt due the Bank. The documents, which form a part of this report, give information,\n\nas to the\n\ndistribution and character of this debt— The committee are next instructed to inquire, as to the character of the transactions\n\nof the Bank, with the\n\nHouse ofNevins, Townsend & Co, of New York. The object of the inquiries on this subject appears to be, to ascertain, if the Bank,\n\nin its transactions\n\nwith thisHouse, has loaned them money, either without, or at a low rate of, interest; or has suffered\n\nany\n\nportion of the stock, which they own in the Bank, to remain unpaid; and, whether the\n\nBank did not keep in\n\ntheir hands, for their advantage, large sums of money, while our citizens, who applied\n\nto the Bank for\n\nfunds inNew York, were refused them— A full examination of the accounts of this house, with the Bank, has assured theCommittee^undersigned^, that none of these abuses have existed— This house has been employed by the Bank, as its agent in New York, for the transaction\n\nof most, if not all,\n\nof its business, to be done through an agent in that City. Their agency commenced,\n\nas appears from the documents herewith\n\nsubmitted, by the transfer to them from thePhenix Bank of\n\nNew York, out of the funds received by that bank, in payment of the Capital Stock of the State\n\nBank,\n\npaid in by individuals, of One Hundred Thousand Dollars: which they were instructed\n\nto vest in Gold Coin\n\nfor the use of the Bank, and one half of which they shortly afterwards forwarded to\n\nthe Bank in gold. The\n\nfunds of the Bank having accumulated at this time in New York, from the paying in\n\nof the capital stock,\n\nand the Phenix Bank having refused to allow any Interest\n\nthereon, a portion of it was deposited with Nevins, Townsend & Co, who gave security,\n\nand\n\nallowed six per cent interest on it— It did not remain long in their hands, however—a\n\ndemand for eastern exchange\n\narising at home, which occasioned its withdrawal— For some time past, this House has\n\nconstantly been the\n\ncreditor of the Bank, for large sums of money paid on the checks of the Bank; and,\n\nat the present time, the Bank is their debtor in the sum of\n\n$150.000— TheCommittee^undersigned^have not been able to discern any thing objectionable in these transactions— It\n\nwould seem that thishousewas not only able, but willing, to make large advances to the Bank, and that\n\nsome advantage must have resulted to those, whom the Bank was, by these means, enabled\n\nto accommodate\n\nwith checks on New York— The necessity of some agency of the Bank in New York is obvious:\n\nand no reason\n\nis seen, for the preference of a Bank over private bankers, if they<Page 6>are able to give\n\nsatisfactory security, as is the case with the house of Nevins, Townsend & Co, who\n\nare bankers\n\nof high character— The committee are next instructed to inquire, if the Capital Stock, subscribed bySamuel WigginsofCincinnati, has been paid in? In prosecuting this inquiry, they have ascertained, that Samuel Wiggins was the original\n\nholder of the\n\nstock of the Bank, to the amount of nearly $200,000; on which he paid several of the\n\nearlier\n\ninstalments: but, that, being disappointed in the sale of his stock, he applied to\n\nthe Bank, and\n\nobtained loans to the amount of $108,000,7for the refunding of which he pledged his Bank stock: which\n\nmoney, so obtained, was applied in paying up the calls made by the Bank, on the purchasers\n\nof its stock—\n\nThis is said to be the only instance^except an amt of about $3000. to other individuals^in\n\nwhich this odious practice has been resorted to— A subterfuge and evasion of the law\n\nof this character\n\nhas been practised in other states to an alarming extent, so as to make the capital\n\nof particular banks\n\nrest upon a paper, instead of a metallic, basis— Whileyour^the^committee^undersigned^regret, that any, even a solitary, case of this sort, should have been tolerated\n\nby the Directors of the State Bank, and do not incline to offer for it any palliation\n\nwhatever, they at the same time feel highly gratified, that this practice, so obnoxious\n\nto well founded objection, has not been general; but that all the other payments of\n\nsubscriptions upon\n\nstock have been made in gold and silver, or in such funds as were authorized to be\n\nreceived by the\n\ncharter of the Bank It has also been made the duty of the committee to ascertain, the nature of the transactions\n\nof the Bank\n\nwith the house ofDenmanofPhiladelphia— whether any loans were made them, whether they were permitted\n\nthe free use of money, collected by the falling due of bills drawn on them, on account\n\nof pork,\n\nbacon, lard & lead, shipped them by the Bank— and whether any bills, drawn on them,\n\nhave\n\nbeen renewed to prevent protest— TheCommittee^undersigned^have not been able, in their examination, to find the slightest trace of any\n\nconnexion between the Bank and the house in question, other than that, which has grown out\n\nof the\n\npurchase, by the Parent Bank andAltonBranch, from our citizens, of bills of exchange drawn on said\n\nhouse.MrDenmanis believed, by theCommittee^undersigned^, to be a^responsible^respectableand wealthy commission merchant, a part of whose business is, dealing in western\n\nproduce as agent for the shippers, and they feel it is due to him to state—that all\n\nthe bills\n\non him, held by the bank, have been fully paid, when due— The next subject of enquiry is the transaction of the Bank with the house ofGrigg & WeldofBoston— It appears that the bank was the holder of about 70.000 $ of the\n\nacceptance\n\nof this House of Dfts drawn on them at Alton and negotiated by the Branch of the bank\n\nthere when they failed and since that time this debt\n\nhas been reduced to $23000 which Sum is considered\n\nby the offices of the bank as being pretty<Page 8>well secured. Intimately connected with this branch of^the^inquiry is the transactions of the bank with the house ofGodfrey Gilman\n\n& Coof Alton, The tabular statement of theCashiershews the amounts of the liabilities of this house, as drawers\n\ndiscounts and endorsers, to have swolen to the immense amount of $800.748.00 which has since been\n\nreduced to the sum ofThree hundred^$419.358.00^Dollars— This debt also is considered to besoundmade safe by collateral security ^The undersigned^YourCommitteefeel less reluctance in introducing the names of these\n\nindividuals, and their private accounts with the Bank from the fact that public rumor\n\nwas rife with\n\nreports and Charges against them, and had not failed to set forth the facts in as\n\nglowing colors at\n\nleast as they\n\nmeritted These two cases are deemed sufficient, to demonstrate the impolicy, of the bank extending\n\nsuch large\n\naccomodations to individuals or firms— many objections might be urged to this course,\n\ntheCommittee^undersigned^however will proceed to notice only a few of them 1stIt deprives the bank of the power of fulfiling one of its important functions towit the extending its accomodations\n\nto\n\nthe Community generally 2d. It is exceedingly hazardous to risk so much upon\n\nthe Solvency of a single individual or firm, as a single failure may result in the\n\nloss of the entire\n\ndebt 3d. The individual or firm having access to the Bank\n\nand being permitted the free use of its funds may monopolize the trade in any speculation\n\nor enterprise in\n\nwhich he chooses to embark 4thNothing is better calculated to\n\nengender\n\nheartburnings and to enlist enemies of the most hostile character against a bank than\n\nfor\n\nthe Community to entertain the belief that the institution is used for the benefit\n\nof the few to the\n\nexclusion of the many— It will be recollected that a charge similar to this— was made\n\nagainst\n\nthe latebank of the United Statesand to sustain that charge it was urged that MrT Biddlein Oct. 1830 was indebted to that institution in\n\nthe sum of $1.120.000— if the objection had any weight in it as applied to the United\n\nStates\n\nBank with its immense capital and circulation with how much greater<Page 10>force does the objection apply to our Bankwithhaving a circulation less than $3,000,000 It is understood that the Directors of theParent houseaware of the impropriety of this course have adopted measures\n\nto restrain directors of branches in again making such excessive loans— whileyourCommittee^the undersigned^decidedly disapprobate this practice of extending such large accomodations to\n\nindividuals or firms, they are gratified to have the opportunity to hear testimony\n\nthat the bank^in\n\na large\n\nmajority of cases^has made\n\nher discounts to\n\ndealers\n\nwanting small sums for immediate use, as will be seen by reference to a tabular statement\n\nfurnished by the Bank and herewith presented For the nature and extent of the loan to theBank of Missouri— reference is made to the Copy of\n\nContract, between the two banks which is herewith submitted The transaction was not fully carried out and the amount loaned was soon returned The arrangement seems to have been made from a desire on the part of thisBankto Cultivate friendly\n\nrelations with a neighboring institution which was about to go into operation It was a part of the Contract with the missouri bank that she should redeem<Page 11>in specie if\n\nnecessary the paper of the State Bank loaned to her, TheCommittee^undersigned^see nothing objectionable in this transaction TheCommittee^undersigned^hasis also charged with the enquiry whether the Bank has dealt or\n\nspeculated in leadlands or other Com^m^odity—\n\nSo far asyour^the undersigned^committeehave been able to learn and ascertain the facts the bank has\n\nnot engaged in speculating in lead, lands or any other commodity. In relation to this\n\ncharge theCommittee^undersigned^have availed themselves of the testimony of the officers of the Bank of the\n\ncorrespondence touching these transactions and of the testimony of respectable gentlemen\n\nresiding at the\n\npoint where these abuses are said to have occured The bank professing to be desirous to enhance the price of lead, in the hand of the\n\nminer or smelter and\n\nto give the profits incident to its reshipment, to the Commission merchants of Alton\n\nrather than to\n\nthose ofSaint Louis, who had hitherto monopolized the trade, made arrangments to have the lead shipped\n\ntoJamesG. Lambof Alton— who was to act as the mutual agent\n\nof the owner of the lead<Page 12>and the Bank in its reshipment and Sale upon the Sale of the lead\n\nafter refunding the money advanced, when the shipment was first made to the Agent,\n\nsay about three\n\nfourths of the market price of the lead together with interest commissions and other\n\ncosts— and charges\n\nincident\n\nto the operation, the overplus accruing from the Sale thereof, was to be paid to the\n\nformer\n\nowner thereby making the bank neither gaining or looser by the fluctuation in price\n\nof the articlesoso shipped— The statement of the officers of the bank is coroberated by the testimony of the other\n\nwitnesses\n\nexamined as to this point as will more fully appear by the accompaning depositions Whileyour^the undersigned^committeefully acquit the bank of the charge of speculating or dealing in lead, they\n\nare constrained to animadvert\n\nupon this course as being unwise and improper on the part of the Bank— It is most\n\nobvious\n\nthat so soon as the arrangement above aluded to was made public, (and its publicity\n\ncould not easily be\n\nprevented) the Commission merchants of Saint Louis and the Keen eyed speculator of the mineral region whose interesthad been^would be^affected injuriously by this operation of the Bank, would wage a simultaneous war\n\nagainst the institution, and prompted by the ever living principle of cupidity each\n\nwould try to excell the other in the malignity of the attack, and in the ferocity\n\nof its procecution— Experience has shewn us that such was the result of this enterprise and the avowed\n\ngood intentions of the\n\nBank have not only been thwarted but much odium has been brot to bear against that\n\ninstitution in\n\nconsequence of the lead operation ^The undersigned^Your Committeebelieves that a Bank should pursue the \"even tenor of her\n\nway\" without lending her influence and her funds to stimulate any particular individual,\n\nin any\n\nparticular branch of business, and whenever she departs from her plain path of duty,\n\nshe is likely to\n\nawaken the vigilant jealousy of the people, and bring upon her own head either ruin\n\nor a loss of\n\nConfidence, which to a Bank is infinitely worse In relation to the charge of the Bank dealing in PorkYour committee^the undersigned^would saythatthey that they have no evidence of that fact, but on the contrary if such has been the\n\ncase,\n\nthose cognisant of it have failed to make the proof, there is one circumstance however\n\nconnected with\n\nthis charge to which theCommittee^undersigned^will advert The cashier of theChicagoBranch with a view ofenteringengaging\n\nin the purchase of pork with MrE K Hubbardand MrDoleprocured their note to be discounted and obtained funds for that purpose aforesaid. Althoyour Committee^the undersigned^do not deny the right of any officer of the Bank in common with other\n\nCitizens to receive accomodations yet they deem it imprudent to embark in speculations\n\nof the staple\n\ncommodities of the Country. and more especially so when the Bank is not prepared to\n\naccomodate all who\n\nmight desire to obtain its paper If the Bank at the time refered to had been prepared to discount the notes of all\n\nwho applied this\n\ncircumstance would probably have excited no remark, but so soon as the notes of others\n\nwere rejected the\n\ndisappointed applicants bitterly complain of favoriteism being extended to bank officers If there is any one subject of which the people are more easily excited than any other\n\nand in regard to\n\nwhich their jealousy never slumbers, it is as to the privileges and powers of Banks therefore every precaution should be used by those institutions to guard against such\n\ncharges or at least to furnish them no foundation to rest upon— ^The undersigned^Your Committeehave not been able to asscertain that the bank has dealt\n\nor speculated in lands further than was absolutely necessary for the erection of her\n\nBanking houses The next enquiry relates to the suspended debts of the Bank at the branches of alton,Galenaand Chicago,\n\nas the examination^in prosecution^of this enquiry necessarily involves an exhibition toyour Committee^the undersigned^of the transaction of the bank with a number of private individuals and as a\n\npublication of their names and accounts would effect no public good they have declined\n\ndoing so\n\n& will only state the general results of the examination A Considerable amount of debt exists at these Branches which at the present is unproductive\n\nand must\n\nrequire much time in the collection— although a proportion of this debt will in all\n\nprobability be\n\nlost it is not believed that the loss will be sufficiently heavy to empair eventually\n\nthe Capital stock of the Bank It will be seen by a refference to an exhibit furnished by the Bankitappearsthat a^contingent^fund of about 170.000$ has been set\n\napart whichyour Committee^the undersigned believe^will indemnify the Bank in any losses on her suspended debt and the\n\nother debts due the bank and branches are believed to be well secured In answer to the enquiry what portions of the loans of the bank have been made to\n\nbank directors theCommittee^undersigned^refer to a statement made by the officers of the Bank and accompanying this\n\nreport althoThe amount due from\n\nbank directors was heretofore larger than it^now^is, and has been reduced by the going out of\n\noffice of some who were largely indebted,your Committee^the undersigned^do not believe that the liability of the present directors is greater than\n\nmight be safely extended to other individuals of equal number andwealth^responsibility^not connected with the Bank The Committee next proceeded to investigate the charge contained in the following\n\nportion of the\n\nresolution to wit \"also the character of the transaction between the acting fund Commissioner\n\nand thePresidentof the Bank\" in the\n\nnegociation\n\nof the Bonds sold to constitute the stock owned by the^State^in that\n\ninstitution and if the Bonds at or since the time of their purchase by the Bank could\n\nnot have been sold\n\nfor Cash at or above par and whether any money has been paid in to represent the stock of the State The answer of the officers of the Bank to this enquiry is that after fruitless efforts\n\nto sell the stock\n\nat par it was offered to the bank in payment of the subscription of the state stock\n\nand was accepted by\n\nthat institution and that the Bonds have ever since been offered at par but have not\n\nbeen sold The amount of stock so sold to the Bank was $1765.000 and the sum of 335.000 Dollars\n\nwas paid in Cash\n\nmaking in all $2,000,000. While it is granted that the sale of the state bonds owned by the bank would have\n\nenabled that\n\ninstitution to enlarge her circulation and thereby accomodate more persons it is deemed very\n\nquestionable whether in the present crisis the stockholders and note holders of the\n\nbank are not in a\n\nbetter condition than if the state bonds had been sold for the reason that they can\n\nbe used to obtain\n\nfunds either by sale or legal\n\nhypothecation The next enquiry is \"whether the bank has not dealtin funds^unfairly^in declaring dividends and reporting means as available which are in reality\n\nunavailable and in bad Debts\" The question of the propriety or impropriety of dividends of the bank must depend\n\non the amount of its bad\n\ndebts as compared with its surplus<Page 18>fund and reserved profits— These latter the officers of the bank have stated on their\n\noaths they believe to equal or exceed the former & thecommittee^undersigned^have no reason to differ from them in opinion on this subject Some of the Committee are aware that there has been a great anxiety with some persons\n\nconnected with the\n\npublic works that the dividends should be as large as possible and were fearful thatthese works^this influence^might have operated on the directors but they have no evidence of such a\n\nresult The last enquiry which the committee are directed to make is \"whether houses connected\n\nwith some of the\n\nprinciple officers of the Bank have not been accomodated largely to the exclusion of others equaly\n\nsolvent\" TheCommittee^undersigned^feel it to be their duty to state without hesitation that there is not the\n\nslightest evidence to support a charge of this character TheCommittee^undersigned^before passing on will offer some reflections upon^the causes of^the\n\nsuspension of specie payments by the bank. It will be recollected that when the Banks\n\nofPhilaand New York suspended specie payments in 1837. that the\n\nwestern and Southern Banks almost simultaneously followed in their train When the Philabanks suspended specie payments last fall, many of the\n\nWestern and Southern banks also found it necessary to close business— There is a chain\n\nof connexion\n\nbetween the banks of the interior and those of the Atlantic Cities which obliges the\n\nformer to follow\n\nthe course of the latter and the suspension of the banks located at the center of\n\ntrade is felt by all\n\nthe banks in the union This is not attributable to any organic defect of the institutions themselves but\n\nto the irresistable\n\nlaw of trade and exchange which cannot be controuled by country banks The position of our banksas^are^^is^doubly unfortunate they have not only to guard against the accumulation of their\n\npaper in\n\nthe Eastern cities but have also to keep an eye upon Saint Louis, at which point much\n\nof the trade of\n\nthe west centers When we\n\nsuper-add to thosetothosecauses the fact, that the funds (mostly gold and silver) of the\n\nGeneral Government collected in the land offices in this State have (with the exception\n\nof a limited\n\ndeposite in the branch at chicago) been transported to and deposited in the banks\n\nofKentuckyand<Page 20>^the Bank of^Missouri. It must therefore be admitted that the banks of this State have had a particularly\n\ndifficult task to\n\nperform in keeping up the credit of their paper Under this view of the subject unless it is first shewn that our banks had some agency\n\nin bringing about\n\nthe suspension by the Banks of the Atlantic Cities in 1837 & '39 Your committee perceives but\n\nlittle cause to visit any very heavy denunciations upon\n\nour institutions for doing an act which they were urged to by the most imperious necessity(and the\n\nperformance of which was a benefit rather than an injury to the Citizens of our own\n\nState) Our opinion as to the solvency of the Bank to meet and to pay all demands against\n\nit, will no doubt be\n\nexpected from the committee. It will be perceived from the Statements of the condition of the bank filed herewith,\n\nthat her entire\n\ncirculation amounts to $2,786.315 and that her whole liabilities are $3.924.002.84/100while she has on hand $2,464,750 of Illinois State Bonds—$2.710,47676/100of notes Discounted and due from individuals to the Bank 440,13210/100Dollars of money loaned to individuals by the Bank and secured by mortgage on real estate— Bills of Exchange $786.97489/100Real Estate 72600.33/100Dollars—due from other Banks. 435,624.27/100dollars^due by state of Illinois 141.08946/100^notes of other Banks 152.275 dollars—of Gold and Silver Coin 473.86932/100dollars making in all 7,677.79413/100Dollars this sum your committee deems amply sufficient to indemnify not only note\n\nholders\n\n& other creditors of the bank but also to secure the State for all the Stock which\n\nshe owns in\n\nthe institution and in the event of the bank not being rescusitated your committee\n\napprehends no damage of the State sustaining any loss upon its bank\n\nStock Before closing thisbranch^report^oftheSubjectit is but an act of justice due from thecommittee^undersigned^to the officers of the parent bank to state, that they afforded the committee\n\nevery facility in their power to aid them in a free & full investigation into the\n\ncondition of\n\nthe bank and into the conduct of its various officers B Monroe}of theSenJno.

      "of the Bank, with the",
      "House ofNevins, Townsend & Co, of New York. The object of the inquiries on this subject appears to be, to ascertain, if the Bank,",
      "with thisHouse, has loaned them money, either without, or at a low rate of, interest; or has suffered",
      "portion of the stock, which they own in the Bank, to remain unpaid; and, whether the",
      "Bank did not keep in",
      "their hands, for their advantage, large sums of money, while our citizens, who applied",
      "funds inNew York, were refused them— A full examination of the accounts of this house, with the Bank, has assured theCommittee^undersigned^, that none of these abuses have existed— This house has been employed by the Bank, as its agent in New York, for the transaction",
      "of most, if not all,",
      "of its business, to be done through an agent in that City. Their agency commenced,",
      "as appears from the documents herewith",
      "submitted, by the transfer to them from thePhenix Bank of",
      "New York, out of the funds received by that bank, in payment of the Capital Stock of the State",

      "This is said to be the only instance^except an amt of about $3000. to other individuals^in",

Anact supplementaryto the incorporation act gave the bank an additional fifty days to suspend specie\n                  payments. Under provisions of the incorporation act and an act supplementary thereto,\n                  if the bank did not resume specie payments within sixty days after suspension, it\n                  would lose its charter. In May 1837, the bank suspended specie payments in response\n                  to thePanic of 1837. In July, a special session of the legislature commenced to deal with the banking\n                  crisis. On July 21, the General Assembly passed anactsuspending until the end of the next general or special session of the legislature\n                  provisions of the law requiring the bank to forfeit its charter for refusing to redeem\n                  its notes in specie for sixty days. In December 1839, the state’s debt crisis forced\n                  the bank to again suspend specie payments. GovernorThomas Carlincalled the legislature into special session to deal with the crisis. In hismessageto the General Assembly, Carlin attacked the bank and demanded an investigation of\n                  its affairs. The legislators complied by establishing the joint select committee.Illinois HouseJournal. 1839. 11th G. A., special sess., 30, 51, 69, 219-20, 221, 222; Illinois SenateJournal. 1839. 11th G.
