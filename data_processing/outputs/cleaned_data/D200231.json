Mr. KITCHELLhoped the House would first take up thebillrelating tointernal improvements. Mr. PECK thought no measure more important than the present. He hoped the House would\n\ngo into Committee forthwith, and decide upon this question. Mr. LINCOLN considered the question of the higest importance, whether an individual had a right to sit in this House or not. The course\n\nhe should propose would be to take up the evidence and decide upon the evidence and\n\ndecide upon the facts seriatim: Mr. DODGEcould see no reason for delay. He hoped the question would be taken up. Mr. CAVARLYapproved of the course proposed by thememberfromSangamon. Mr. GRIDLEYdid not fear the result: though the testimony was voluminous, it had been arranged\n\nin reference to each vote, he hoped it would be taken up and each vote decided upon\n\naccording to the evidence singly.

It could not be properly\n\ndecided on the spur of the moment, and in heat of debate. He wished for time calmly\n\nand dispassionately to examine into the evidence before being called upon to decide\n\nas a judge or as a juror; for this purpose he hoped that the whole evidence as well\n\nas the reports made by the committee would be printed, to afford the House time and\n\nopportunity to examine into this most important subject. Mr. LINCOLN thought that the question had better be gone into now. In courts of\n\nlaw Jurors were required to decide on evidence without previous study or examination.\n\nThey were required to know nothing of the subject untill the evidence was laid before them for their immediate decision. He thought that the\n\nheat of party would be augmented by delay. TheSpeakercalledMr. L.to order as being irrelevant no mention had been made of party-heat.— Mr. DRUMMOND said he had spoken only of debate. Mr. LINCOLN asked what caused the heat, if it was not party?Mr. L.concluded by urging that the question would be decided now better than hereafter,\n\nand he thought with less heat and excitement. Mr. DRUMMOND replied: he disclaimed all party feeling, his object was to have time\n\nto examine the subject fairly. Mr. PECK moved that the House do now go into committee of the whole, which motion\n\nafter some animated discussion between Messrs Peck, Hardin and Kitchell was agreed\n\nto.

In thestate election of August 1840, Phelps, theWhigcandidate, had defeated Purple, theDemocrat, by a meager seven votes in the race to represent Peoria County, and Purple had contested\n                  the canvass, claiming that fifteen voters had cast illegal ballots for Phelps, whereas\n                  he had only received eight illegal votes. Purple also purported that election officials\n                  had rejected two of his supporters at the polls without cause. On November 25, the\n                  House appointed a select committee to investigate Purple’s contentions.  This select\n                  committee had five Democrats and four Whigs.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G. A., 7, 8, 59-61; Theodore C.
