        "text": "2Lincoln is discussing what ultimately became the caseIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parke. The Illinois Central Railroad owned 118 acres of land in McLean County, Illinois.\n                  The county assessor levied a $428.57 tax on the railroad's property.  The railroad\n                  claimed that theIllinois General Assemblyact incorporating the railroad exempted the railroad from taxes. In September 1853,\n                  the railroad sued McLean County in theMcLean County Circuit Courtfor an injunction to stop the county from selling railroad land to pay taxes. In\n                  late-September 1853, the parties reached an agreement, in which the circuit court\n                  would dismiss the bill, thus ruling for McLean County, and the railroad would appeal\n                  the case to theIllinois Supreme Court, where the only question would be whether the county had a lawful right to tax the\n                  Illinois Central Railroad’s property.In September 1853,Thomson R. Webberhad expressed interest in having Lincoln represent him against the railroad, but\n                  ultimately did not retain him.Illinois Central RR v.

        "text": "3Lincoln was traveling to circuit courts throughout theEighth Judicial Circuitfor nine weeks. He departedSpringfieldduring the second week in September and did not return until November 10.Mason Braymanrepliedto this letter on  October 7, 1853, offering Lincoln a retainer fee of $250 on behalf\n                  of the railroad company, which he enclosed. Lincoln represented the railroad in its\n                  Illinois Supreme Court case, which began in December 1853. In December 1855, the Illinois\n                  Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the McLean County Circuit Court, and  JusticeWalter B. Scatesruled that the Illinois General Assembly could exempt property from taxation.  Therefore,\n                  the Illinois Central Railroad’s charter was constitutional.  Lincoln received $5,000\n                  for his legal services, although he had to sue the railroad in 1857 to collect the\n                  fee.At the request of Brayman, Lincoln declined new cases against the railroad that came\n                  his way between 1853 and 1855, passing at least some on toJohn T. Stuartand therefore lost opportunities to earn legal fees as a direct result of his employment\n                  for the railroad.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 7 September 1853,http://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1853-09-07; 10 November 1853,http://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1853-11-10;Illinois Central RR v.
