        "text": "2At this time Abraham Lincoln was running against incumbent senator Stephen A. Douglas\n                  to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. In addition to their extensive campaigning throughout the state in the summer and\n                  autumn of 1858, the two men were also facing off in theLincoln-Douglas Debates. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.The first Lincoln-Douglas Debate was held inOttawaon August 21, 1858. On the following day, Douglas purportedly wrote Usher F. Linder\n                  requesting his help in campaigning, in light of prominentRepublicanshaving  been enlisted to speak at the second debate inFreeporton August 27. Linder’s neighbor, Jacob I. Brown, also wrote to Douglas on August\n                  26 to suggest that Linder help Douglas campaign. Douglas responded to Brown on August\n                  29, agreeing that it was “important that Gen. Linder should take the stump immediately.”\n                  On September 7, theChicago Tribunepublished what it claimed was an extract of a recent letter from Douglas to Linder.\n                  This supposed letter, which may have been Douglas’ unlocated letter of August 22,\n                  reportedly included the plea “For God‘s sake, Linder, come up into the Northern part\n                  of the State and help me. Every dog in the State is let loose after me--from the bull-dogTrumbullto the smallest canine quadruped that has a kennel in Illinois.” By September 11,\n                  1858, Linder was with Douglas inSt. Louis, where the pair made speeches together.Allen C.
