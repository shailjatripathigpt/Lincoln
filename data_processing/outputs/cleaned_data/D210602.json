Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.

He likely wrote such a letter to\n                  Paine, although no correspondence between Lincoln and Paine has been located in all\n                  of 1854 prior to this letter.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.
