Land claims came under provisions of section nine of an act passed byCongresson February 11, 1847.  Section five of anactpassed on July 19, 1848 gave three-months extra pay to all soldiers who engaged in\n                  military service during the Mexican War who completed their term of enlistment or\n                  had been honorably discharged.

        "text": "3Barnburners” wereDemocratswho supportedMartin Van Buren.  Lincoln was no doubt referring to anti-slavery and some regular Whigs who condemned\n                  the nomination ofZachary Taylor, a southern slaveholder with no previous affiliation with the Whigs, as the party’s\n                  candidate in thepresidential campaign of 1848.  Many Whigs viewed Taylor’s nomination as an abandonment of Whig principles and,\n                  as an act of protest,Henry Clayand many others refused to endorse Taylor and participate in the campaign.  Accusations\n                  that Taylor was not a Whig plagued his campaign, and Lincoln and other Taylorite Whigs,\n                  lead byJohn J. Crittenden, spent the summer and fall of 1848 working to convince party faithful and neutrals\n                  of the general’s Whig bona fides.\n                  Lincoln was also referring to disgruntled Democrats who opposed the nomination ofLewis Cassas the Democratic Party standard bearer.  For some “Conscience” Whigs and disaffected\n                  Democrats, these nominations proved the last straw, and they began making plans for\n                  an anti-slavery party. Conscience Whigs and Van Buren Democrats came together to form\n                  theFree Soil Party. The party held a convention inBuffaloin August and nominated Van Buren for president.Michael F. Holt,The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of\n                        the Civil War(New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 333-39; K.

        "text": "4Lincoln proved prescient regarding New York: Taylor won the state and its vital thirty-six\n                  electoral votes with 47.9% of the popular vote, to 25.1% for Cass and 26.4% for Van\n                  Buren.Lincoln’s forecast for Ohio and New England proved less accurate.  Ohio followed most\n                  of the Old Northwest and went for Cass, giving him  47% of the vote to Taylor’s 42.1%\n                  and Van Buren’s 10.8%.In New England, Taylor won inMassachusetts,Connecticut,Rhode Island, andVermont, with Cass winning inMaineandNew Hampshire. Taylor only received an absolute majority, however, in Rhode Island, and Cass only\n                  in New Hampshire. The Free Soil Party made significant inroads in their respective\n                  majorities, indicating the growing influence of anti-slavery rhetoric in the region.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:280-84; John L.
