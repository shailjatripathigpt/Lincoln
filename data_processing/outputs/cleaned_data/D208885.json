        "text": "3Roughly one month before writing this endorsement on behalf of Francis, Lincoln sent\n                  Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing atelegramrecommending Francis for appointment as surveyor general of the Oregon Territory.\n                  In the end, however, the first person appointed to this position was John B. Preston,\n                  who was appointed by PresidentMillard Fillmore.Prior to recommending Francis for this position Lincoln had recommended him for secretary\n                  of the Oregon Territory, a position PresidentZachary Taylorawarded Lincoln on August 9, 1849, but which Lincoln declined. OtherIllinoisWhigs had also pressed for Francis to receive the appointment, but Taylor ultimately\n                  awarded the position to Edward Hamilton ofOhio.Francis’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did\n                  not receive any other appointment during this period. The 1861 official register shows\n                  Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment either, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Appointment of Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Territory of Oregon;Abraham Lincoln to John M.
