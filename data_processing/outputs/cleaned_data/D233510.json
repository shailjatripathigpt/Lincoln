        "text": "4During the campaign of 1858, the Democratic Party faced a split between pro-Douglas\n                  and pro-James Buchananfactions. The split occurred after Douglas, in December 1857, spoke out against theLecompton Constitution, and criticized President Buchanan for supporting it. Although Douglas later denied\n                  it, he intimated in correspondence and in meetings that he was finished with the Democratic\n                  Party and courted political support from Republicans in an effort to bolster his chances\n                  of reelection to the U.S. Senate. Some Republicans, excited by Douglas’ repudiation\n                  of the Lecompton Constitution, considered supporting him as well as local anti-Lecompton\n                  Democratic candidates. Douglas met in person with prominent Republicans such asHorace Greeley, who, via theNew York Tribune, urged voters in Illinois to support Douglas’ reelection bid.Anson Burlingame, another prominent Republican, agreed with Greeley and delivered an address in theU.S. House of Representativesurging voters to support both Douglas and his political allies.Throughout the 1858 campaign Lincoln discouraged Republican involvement in Democratic\n                  factional disputes and urged loyalty to the Republican Party in the impending election.\n                  Lincoln had also expressed doubt at least as early as 1856 about the wisdom and efficacy\n                  of political parties interfering in the electoral campaigns of other states. TheChicago Daily Tribunehad previously published articles noting how pleased some Democrats were with Greeley’s\n                  support for Douglas and criticizing Republicans in other states—including Burlingame—for\n                  urging Republicans in Illinois to unite with anti-Lecompton Democrats in order to\n                  aid Douglas’ efforts to secure reelection to the U.S. Senate. At the time, members\n                  of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore,\n                  the local races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the state’s U.S. Senate race.The Douglas/Buchanan conflict extended to local political campaigns for the U.S. House\n                  of Representatives in 1858.  In the Indiana Seventh Congressional District, pro-Lecompton\n                  Democrat Henry Secrest challenged Anti-Lecompton Democrat John G. Davis, the incumbent,\n                  for the seat.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445-48, 453-54;Abraham Lincoln to James W. Grimes;Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 31 December 1857, 1:2; 28 April 1858, 2:1; Allen C.

        "text": "5This is a reference to the administration of President Buchanan and to a congressional\n                  bill proposed byWilliam H. Englishand others in the spring of 1858. The so-called English bill proposed sending the\n                  Lecompton Constitution back to the voters of theKansas Territorywith a modification to the territory’s request for a federal land grant—reduced to\n                  4 million acres from the requested 23 million acres. In essence, the bill offered\n                  Kansas voters statehood in exchange for accepting slavery. If Kansas voters rejected\n                  the offer, the English bill stipulated that the territory could not reapply for statehood\n                  until a census showed it possessed a population of at least 90,000 people. Douglas\n                  considered supporting the bill, but ultimately opposed it.  The bill passed both the\n                  U.S. Senate and the U.S. House on April 30, and President Buchanan signed it into\n                  law. On August 2, Kansans overwhelmingly rejected this Lecompton Constitution-cum-land\n                  grant by a vote of 11,300 to 1,788.David M. Potter and Don E. Fehrenbacher,The Impending Crisis, 1848-1861(New York: Harper & Row, 1976), 323-25."

Davis lost the Democratic\n                  Party’s nomination for the district by a similar margin, but later joined the race\n                  as an independent anti-Lecompton candidate.

In Illinois’ local elections of that year, Republicans won\n                  a majority of the votes cast, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and, in the end, Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate in the\n                  1858 Federal Election. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his\n                  participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.Lincoln and Ray exchanged at least eleven additional letters during 1858 related to\n                  the local and federal elections of that year. Despite the dissatisfaction he voices\n                  in this June 27 letter, Lincoln remained on good terms with Ray and, in June 1859,\n                  while renewing his subscription to theChicago Press and Tribune, expressed gratitude for the paper’s “devotion to our cause always, and to me personally\n                  last year.”Seymour Times(IN), 2 December 1858, 3:1;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 13 November 1858, 2:3; Allen C.
