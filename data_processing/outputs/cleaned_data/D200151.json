        "text": "2In January 1839, theHouse of Representativesreceived several petitions for and against the division of Sangamon County.  The\n                  House referred these petitions to the Committee on Counties, on which satAbraham Lincoln.  In response to these petitions, Lincoln of the Committee on Counties introduced\n                  this  bill in  the House  on January 16, 1839.  The House referred it to a select\n                  committee that included Lincoln. The committee reported back the bill on January 18\n                  with amendments. Lincoln called for the House to vote on each amendment separately.\n                  The House rejected amendments to sections 1,2, and 8 but approved amendments to sections 3, 4, and 13. The House then passed an\n                  additional amendment, adding a section fifteen. Lincoln made a motion to add “Newton”\n                  to section four, and the House concurred. The House passed two additional amendments,\n                  adding “April” to section ten and “first” to section twelve. The House further amended\n                  the bill by, on Lincoln’s motion, filling in the blank in section seven with the word\n                  “$3,000.”   The House passed the bill as amended on January 21. TheSenatereferred the bill to a select committee on February 5. The committee reported back\n                  the bill  on February 6 withseveral amendments, in which the Senate concurred.  The Senate passed the bill as amended. That same\n                  day the House, on Lincoln’s motion,  amended the Senate’s amendment to the fourth\n                  section by changing the word “two” to “three.” The House concurred in the Senate amendments\n                  as amended.  Still later that day  the House, on Lincoln’s motion,  reconsidered its\n                  previous vote and adopted anamendmentto the Senate’s amendment to  section four.  The House concurred in the Senate amendments\n                  as amended.   The Senate concurred in the House amendment to its amendments on February\n                  7. TheCouncil of Revisionapproved the bill on February 15, and theactbecame law.Illinois HouseJournal. 1838.  11th G.

        "text": "6On February 6, the Senate passedamendmentsstriking out reference to Richard Wariner and Achilles Morris and adding two provisos\n                  to the end of the section dealing with the boundaries of Menard County if said commissioners\n                  selected a site for the county seat on the west or left side of the Sangamon River.\n                  Later that same day, the House of Representatives passed anamendment, authored and moved by Lincoln,  to the Senate amendment, modifying the proposed\n                  Senate boundaries if the commissioners selected a county seat on the west side of\n                  the Sangamon.  Both provisos and Lincoln’s proposed boundaries would be included in\n                  theact.The first proviso shifted a portion of the boundary between Sangamon and Menard counties\n                  further north and west, leaving more territory to the north and west ofAthens.  On May 18, 1839, the commissioners appointed for the task located the county seat\n                  atPetersburg, on the western side of the river, activating the proviso.  The status of approximately\n                  22 sections west and north of Athens, however,  remained in question.    The affected\n                  area did not include the town of Athens, which remained in Sangamon County.  In 1840,Thomas J. Nanceunsuccessfully attempted to address the confusion by introducing abillthat repealed this proviso and designated this area as part of Menard County.  A\n                  year later,John Bennettintroduced  abillto settle the boundary between Sangamon and Menard counties.  After the House refused\n                  to engross it, Bennett tried again unsuccessfully to enact its main provisions in\n                  anotherbill. The General Assembly did not resolve the issue until it passed an act in 1843 adding\n                  land west of the Sangamon River to Menard County and an additional act in 1847 adding\n                  land east of the Sangamon River, including Athens, to Menard County.Illinois HouseJournal. 1838. 11th G.

Using\n                  his position on the Committee on Counties, Lincoln hoped to divide the county in such\n                  a manner that Sangamon would not be disadvantaged.
