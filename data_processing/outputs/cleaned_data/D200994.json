        "text": "3Lincoln is discussing the caseSprague v. Illinois River RR et al. In August 1857,Charles Sprague, a resident ofCass County, Illinois, retained Lincoln and Dummer and sued for an injunction to prevent the county from\n                  paying theIllinois River Railroad Company$50,000 in stock subscriptions approved by the voters. TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in 1853 to build a road fromJacksonville, Illinois, through Cass County toLa Salle, Illinois.  In 1854, however, the General Assembly amended the charter to allow the railroad\n                  to build a road fromVirginia, IllinoistoPekin, Illinois. The railroad also held the option of extending the route north from Pekin to La\n                  Salle. Sprague, who also was president of the Rock Island and Alton Railroad Company,\n                  claimed that he had consulted engineers who stated that part of the railroad’s route\n                  was an “absurd proposition” due to rough terrain and the presence of three other railroads.\n                  Sprague also believed that the alteration of the railroad’s charter constituted a\n                  breach of contract and voided the county stock subscription.  TheCass County Circuit Courtdisagreed, and dismissed the injunction.  Sprague appealed to theIllinois Supreme Court, which, in January 1858, affirmed the lower court’s ruling.  Chief JusticeJohn D. Catondeclared that the Illinois General Assembly’s 1854 amendment of the railroad’s charter\n                  was “in the highest degree promotive of the interests of the company” and not a major\n                  deviation from the charter's original intent. Lincoln charged Sprague $50.00 for his\n                  legal services.Lincoln and Dummer exchanged at least three more letters related to this case.Newton Bateman and Paul Selby, eds.,Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of Cass County, ed. by Charles Æ.
