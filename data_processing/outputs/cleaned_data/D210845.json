        "text": "3Stephen A. Douglas was one of the Democratic Party’s primary proponents of popular\n                  sovereignty—the concept that each states’ voters had the right to determine whether\n                  or not that state would allow slavery. Under theKansas-Nebraska Act, the status of slavery within theNebraskaand Kansas territories was to be determined through popular sovereignty. In 1857,\n                  however, the Democratic Party split into pro-Douglas and pro-James Buchananfactions over theLecompton Constitutionand popular sovereignty after President Buchanan supported passage of the Lecompton\n                  Constitution and Douglas criticized Buchanan, asserting that the Lecompton Constitution\n                  undermined popular sovereignty. See theKansas-Nebraska ActandBleeding Kansas.At the time of this letter, Douglas was running for reelection to theU.S. Senateand Lincoln was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace him. Douglas and Lincoln debated the concept\n                  of popular  sovereignty repeatedly throughout thecampaign of 1858, including during theLincoln-Douglas Debates.  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445, 458; David Herbert\n                     Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 201-4."

Lincoln’s letter\n                  to Judge Kellogg has not been located.On August 19, 1858 attendees of the Fourth Illinois Congressional District Republican\n                  Convention nominated Judge Kellogg to run for reelection to theU.S. House of Representatives.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 21 August 1858, 2:5; Howard W.

        "text": "5According to an 1857 law, the Fulton County Circuit Court met on the fourth Mondays\n                  of February, the fourth Mondays of May, and the second Mondays of November. No additional\n                  laws changing the meeting times of the court could be located between this 1857 law\n                  and the date of this letter.  However, theChicago Daily Press and Tribunestated in an article that the court met during the third week in August, which matches\n                  what Proctor states above.Douglas delivered his campaign speech in Lewistown on August 16, and Lincoln delivered\n                  an address in Lewistown the next day. Judge Kellogg introduced Lincoln to the assembled\n                  crowd. Douglas’ audience on August 16 was estimated at 3,000; Lincoln’s was estimated\n                  at 2,000.In the end, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas ultimately won reelection. Through\n                  the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas\n                  Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican\n                  Party.In the1858 Federal Election, Judge Kellogg won reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives, garnering 52.8\n                  percent of the vote to his Democratic opponent,James W. Davidson’s, 45.7 percent.\"An Act to Change the Fifth and Tenth Judicial Circuits, and Fix the Time of Holding\n                     Courts Therein,\" 29 January 1857,Laws of Illinois(1857), 5;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(Illinois), 20 August 1858, 2:4; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:482-83, 556-57; Allen C.
