Carroll County,  a Republican-leaning\n                  northern county, belonged to the Third Illinois Senate District, which also includedOgle,Winnebago, andBoonecounties, and the Fifty-First Illinois House District with Jo Daviess County. In\n                  elections for the Illinois General Assembly in 1858, Republican Zenos Applington \n                  of Ogle won the seat in the Third Illinois Senate District.

        "text": "5Lincoln  and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted were those who had moved into the\n                  American Party following the dissolution of the Whig Party. Former members of the\n                  American Party, often referred to colloquially as \"Fillmore Men\" because the national\n                  party backedMillard Fillmorein thepresidential election of 1856, were an important source of votes for both Democrats and Republicans in the state\n                  and federal elections of 1858, and both Lincoln and Douglas worked hard to garner\n                  their support.In thepresidential election of 1856, Carroll County split 1,551 total votes—1,161 (74.9 percent) Republican, 237 (15.3\n                  percent) Democrat and 153 (9.9 percent) American Party.  The Republican majority was\n                  771.  In the congressional election, the county split 1,546 total votes—1,182 (76.5\n                  percent) Republican, 237 (15.3 percent) Democrat, and 127 (8.2 percent) other, which\n                  mainly consisted of American votes. Republicans’ majority stood at 818 votes. In1858 congressional election, Carroll County split 1,446 votes; similar to 1856, Republicans captured 1,137  (78.6\n                  percent), Democrats captured 256 (17.7 percent), and Americans captured 53 (3.7 percent)\n                  votes. The Republicans’ majority in 1858 stood at 828 votes.In the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won\n                  reelection.Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.
