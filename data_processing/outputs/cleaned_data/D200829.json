        "text": "1Abraham Lincolnwrote this document.Curators at the Library of Congress assigned 1849 as the date for these notes, but\n                  there is no evidence to support this contention.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, inferred the date of January 4, 1855.  He derived this date from the fact that Lincoln\n                  addressed the  Illinois State Colonization Society on that date.   He had been announced as\n                  speaker  for the society’s annual meeting the year before, on January 12, 1854, but\n                  was prevented from attending on account of illness in his family.Lincoln had also spoken on colonization on August 30, 1853.  Neither a handwritten\n                  or published version of this speech has been located.  Although this outline might\n                  conceivably have been prepared for either the 1853 or 1854 occasions, the editors\n                  agree with Basler that it seems in appearance to belong to the period of theresolutionsthat Lincoln penned recommending amendment of theKansas-Nebraska Act.Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 30 August 1853, 3:1; 14 January 1854, 2:1;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 30 August 1853,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1853-08-30; 12 January 1854,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1854-01-12; Roy P.
