William Wernwag, the bridge’s contractor, failed to pay some of his sub-contractors,\n                  which spurred several lawsuits in which Abraham Lincoln and his partnerJohn T. Stuartrepresented the creditors seeking payment. During those legal proceedings, Wernwag\n                  died, and then Lincoln initiated this legislation on behalf of his clients and others\n                  who may have lost money in the construction of the bridge.An Act for the Relief of the Creditors of the Late William Wernwag;An Act to Authorize and Require the County Commissioners' Court of Sangamon County\n                        to Build a Bridge over the Sangamon River; Chapter 4:Hoffman v.
