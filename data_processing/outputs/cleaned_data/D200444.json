On April 21, 1836, Texas forces routed Santa Anna and his army at the Battle\n                  of San Jacinto, and on April 22, the Texans took Santa Anna prisoner.  On May 14,\n                  Santa Anna signed two treaties, one public and one private, which together became\n                  known as the Treaty of Velasco.  In the public treaty, Santa Anna agreed to end hostilities,\n                  and in the private and confidential agreement he agreed to work to persuade the Mexican\n                  government to accept Texan independence.  In exchange for these treaties, the Texans\n                  agreed to free Santa Anna and allow him to return to Mexico.  The Mexican Government,\n                  however, repudiated the public agreement, arguing that it was invalid because Santa\n                  Anna was a prisoner when it was concluded.Lincolntranscribedthe public portion of the Treaty of Velasco for inclusion in thepamphletandCongressional GlobeAppendix versions of his speech.Internal evidence from both the handwritten and printed versions of Lincoln’s speech\n                  suggests that he copied this treaty fromNiles’ Weekly Register.

        "text": "22President Polk and General Winfield Scott had a contentious and tenuous relationship\n                  from the beginning of Polk’s administration.  A protégé ofAndrew Jackson, Polk shared his mentor’s distrust of the army officer corps, seeking it as a bastion\n                  of Whiggery.  Scott’s feud with Jackson, which stretched back to theWar of 1812and intensified during Jackson’s presidency, pushed Scott into the Whig camp, and\n                  his presidential ambitions further increased Polk’s suspicions of his senior general.\n                  Nevertheless, on May 13, 1846, the day he signed the declaration of war, Polk asked\n                  Scott to command the army in Mexico.  Scott accepted the assignment, but Polk immediately\n                  became unhappy with Scott’s plan for equipping, training, and transporting 20,000\n                  volunteers to the front, which he believed could not be accomplished until September\n                  1846.  Needing a quick victory in a controversial war, Polk felt that at best Scott\n                  was dragging his feet or at worst was sabotaging the war effort for political purposes.\n                  For his part, Scott believed that Polk was set on discrediting him and the army in\n                  the eyes of the public by advocating action before preparations were complete.  The\n                  conflict came to a head when Scott wrote numerous inflammatory letters, which Polk\n                  used as a pretext to remove him from command.  Scott remained inWashington, DC, whileZachary Taylorled the U.S. forces in Northern Mexico.Reprimanded and consigned to administrative duties, Scott was unfazed, and he began\n                  drawing up an ambitious strategy to end the war by capturingMexico Cityby way ofVeracruz.  By November 1846, it had become clear that Taylor’s offensive in Northern Mexico\n                  would not be decisive, and Polk recalled Scott to execute his plan.  Scott launched\n                  the invasion in February 1847, and captured Mexico City in September 1847.  Scott\n                  became embroiled, however, in a conflict with subordinate officers Gideon Pillow,\n                  an old friend of President Polk, andWilliam   J. Worth, resulting in Scott having both arrested.  Polk and Secretary of WarWilliam L. Marcybacked Pillow and Worth, and Polk used this as a pretext to relieve Scott from command.\n                  On January 3, 1848, Polk recalled Scott from Mexico and ten days later Secretary Marcy\n                  replaced him with GeneralWilliam O. Butler.   On January 31 and April 17, Lincoln voted for resolutions calling upon President\n                  Polk to explain Scott’s removal from command.U.S. HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 331, 689-90; Walter R.
