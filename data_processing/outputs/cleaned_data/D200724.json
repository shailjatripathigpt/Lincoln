        "text": "3Abraham Lincoln wrote and signed this endorsement.  The document has a hole cut out,\n                  rendering some of Lincoln’s text missing.  The supplied text comes from the reconstruction\n                  inThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln.Anson L. Brewer and Lincoln reference a lawsuit involvingJames KellyandJesse D. Blackledge.  In August 1838, Kelly sold his share of a mill in Columbiana County, Ohio, to Nathan\n                  Harris, who financed the transaction with a series of promissory notes, with Blackledge\n                  as security.  Harris and Blackledge did not redeem the notes upon their maturity,\n                  and in August 1845, Kelly brought suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Columbiana\n                  County to recover the debt.  In June 1847, the court rendered a judgment against Blackledge\n                  and Harris for $632.59.  Blackledge failed to satisfy the judgment and moved toLogan County, Illinois.  Brewer, Kelly’s attorney inOhio, traced Blackledge to Logan County.  In October 1852, Kelly retainedLincoln & Herndonand sued Blackledge in theLogan County Circuit Courtto recover the debt.  Blackledge died, and Kelly dismissed the case in order to file\n                  a claim against the Blackledge’s estate.  Kelly continued to employ Lincoln & Herndon,\n                  and in 1854, he filed a claim againstDavid G. Evans, the executor of Blackledge's estate, in the Logan County Court.  In April 1855,\n                  the court refused the claim because Kelly had not filed the claim in time.  In September\n                  1855, Kelly appealed the judgment to the Logan County Circuit Court.  The court ruled\n                  for Kelly and awarded him the judgment award from Ohio.In 1855, Lincoln wrote Brewer three additional letters about this case, and Brewer\n                  wrote one additional letter.Henry C.
