        "text": "2Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Abraham Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored\n                  over Morrison and Edwards. Lincoln summarized his objections to Butterfield’s appointment\n                  as commissioner in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston.In early June 1849, Lincoln sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting\n                  letters in support of his candidacy. Although no such letter from Lincoln to Henry\n                  has been located, it is likely Lincoln made a similar request of him. Henry wrote\n                  Lincoln several other letters on this topic. Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards,\n                  nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job went to Butterfield instead. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B.
