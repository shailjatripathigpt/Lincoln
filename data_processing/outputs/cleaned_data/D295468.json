Ruckelon September 28, 1857 in connection with a mortgage on four lots of land in Springfield,\n                  Illinois that they wished to purchase. Jacob had acquired the east parts of lots thirteen,\n                  fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen in block four of theElijah Illes’ addition to Springfield from the estate of his brother,Daniel E. Ruckel(whom Lincoln had also loaned money in August 1851 and whose estate Jacob helped\n                  administer). Jacob and Laura agreed to repay the $500 mortgage to Lincoln, plus ten\n                  percent interest for the year, within one year. The mortgage was extended multiple\n                  times, but eventually paid in full in January 1864.Harry E.
