        "text": "2Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to political allies\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. When the General\n                  Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, ten rounds of voting were needed\n                  to finally determine a victor. Lincoln received a majority of the anti-Nebraska votes\n                  until the tenth and final ballot, when he withdrew and urged his supporters to vote\n                  for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With the votes\n                  of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See1854 Federal Election.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

        "text": "4In an October 16, 1854, speech inPeoria,  Lincoln had articulated his views on the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Missouri Compromise,\n                  and the Compromise measures of 1850.  He declared the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\n                  as “wrong” and argued that it “ought to be restored”--repudiating the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act, which in effect repealed it.  He also asserted his objection to the further spread\n                  of slavery outside of its current environs.  However, Lincoln acknowledged the constitutional\n                  right of southerners to federal legislation to reclaim runaway slaves, though he believed\n                  that law should not, “in its stringency, be more likely to carry a free man into slavery,\n                  than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.” He was also unwilling\n                  to assert that no additional slave states would be added to the Union.According toThomas J. Henderson, Lincoln followed a middle course, telling legislators that, if elected to the Senate,\n                  he would not vote against the Fugitive Slave Act, but would vote to remove its more\n                  odious features.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:396."
