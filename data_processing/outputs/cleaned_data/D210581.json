He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run forU.S. Senate.

        "text": "4The Illinois General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make\n                  their selection for the U.S. Senate. In the first round of voting, representatives\n                  David Strawn and Frederick S. Day both voted for Lincoln, who received forty-five\n                  of the ninety-nine votes cast. As no candidate received a majority of votes, nine\n                  more rounds of balloting ensued.  Neither Strawn nor Day voted for Lincoln again in\n                  the subsequent rounds of voting. Strawn divided his votes betweenLyman TrumbullandWilliam B. Ogden, and Day voted for Martin P. Sweet in the second and third rounds before switching\n                  his support to Trumbull. With his own share of votes declining Lincoln dropped out\n                  of contention in the tenth round and urged his supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska\n                  Democrat Trumbull in order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat.\n                  Both Strawn and Day voted for Trumbull in the tenth round of voting during which he\n                  gained a majority of votes and was elected Illinois’ next U.S. senator.
