        "text": "2The author is likely using the term “Arab” as a pejorative, perhaps to accuse the\n                  pro-Stephen A. Douglasjournalists as being homeless or shiftless. In addition,Little Egyptwas a popular nickname for southernIllinoisand a particular stronghold of the Democratic Party. Denizens of  areas in portions\n                  of the Ottoman Empire, includingEgypt, were referred to colloquially as Arabs.  As such, the author may be referencing\n                  Douglas’s supporters in the press from southern Illinois, labeling them “Arab,” while\n                  simultaneously accusing them of inflating crowd numbers at Douglas’s speeches.Lincoln had been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Democrat Douglas to represent Illinois in theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  efforts during thecampaign of 1858on the formerWhig Partystronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.

        "text": "3In his July 9 speech inChicago, Douglas accused Lincoln of fomenting a sectional war, declaring, “this government\n                  was made by the white man, for the benefit of the white man, to be administered by\n                  white men... I am opposed to negro equality.” This ran in opposition to Lincoln, according\n                  to Douglas, who wanted to afford “the negro of the privileges, immunities and rights\n                  of citizenship.” Douglas then detailed the rights that only white men should hold,\n                  including the right to vote, hold office, or serve on a jury.In the firstdebatebetween Douglas and Lincoln on August 21, Lincoln argued, \"I have no purpose directly\n                  or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it\n                  exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do\n                  so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white\n                  and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which in my judgment\n                  will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality,\n                  and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference. I, as well\n                  as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong, having the superior position.\n                  I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that notwithstanding all this,\n                  there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights\n                  enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty and the\n                  pursuit of happiness.\"Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 468;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 10 July 1858, 1:4; First Debate with Stephen A.

During his nomination at the 1858 Illinois Republican Convention, Lincoln\n                  delivered an address—widely known as his “House Divided” speech—in which he charged\n                  that Douglas was part of a plot or conspiracy to nationalize slavery. Lincoln argued\n                  that the plot began with Douglas’ Kansas-Nebraska bill, which PresidentFranklin Piercesupported, then was advanced by both theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Dred Scott case—handed down byRoger B. Taney—and by President James Buchanan’s call to support the court’s decision. Lincoln warned\n                  his audience that, if Douglas were not defeated and the slave power not overthrown,\n                  another Supreme Court ruling could build upon the Dred Scott decision and proclaim\n                  that the U.S. Constitution prohibited states from excluding slavery within their own\n                  borders.Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 206-9."
