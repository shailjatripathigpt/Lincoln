        "text": "2Dubois references the movement to draft Abraham Lincoln for a seat in the U.S. Senate\n                  in the aftermath of the1854 congressional elections.  Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into the election\n                  campaign in the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee to supplantJames Shields, the incumbent senator running for reelection. Lincoln began quietly seeking support\n                  for a Senate candidacy, writing confidentially to Dubois and other political allies\n                  and friends.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

Richardson, and Yates toThomas L. Harris.The state’s voters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  in which Lincoln also won a seat. However, in late-November 1854, he declined to serve\n                  in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election to\n                  the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Thomas R. McClure cast his ballot for Lincoln until the ninth ballot, when\n                  he switched to Trumbull.  Raymond Heath did not cast any ballots in the senate election.\n                  See the1854 Federal Election.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.
