The\n                  pair had earlier exchanged letters onJuly 20andJuly 25, 1858 on the subject of arranging a speech by Lincoln in Tremont during the1858 election campaignand on the importance of Tazewell County to the election. Lincoln had been nominated\n                  at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.
