    "full_text": "Henry C. Whitney to Abraham Lincoln, 23 June 18581 The attack upon you in todays “Chicago Times” is far more dangerous than many persons might suppose:= the charge of your refusal\n\nto vote for the appropriation Bill is the most potent & dangerous weapon that can\n\nbe used against you in the rural districts:= of course (even if true) it would have\n\nno effect with men of sense but it is true andDouglassand his yelpers know it in all its breadth & depth that it is the very thing to take\n\nin the byeways & hedges:=2When I was stumping withSomers&Coler2 years since they took especial pains to try it in every speech they made until\n\nI spoke to you about it and you pronounced it false & I made them eat the statement:=\n\nI saw MessrsScripps&Arnoldabout it this morning & they neither one knew anything about its falsity:=C L Wilsonis not here^nor isJudd^:= Scripps agrees with me in the importance of an early refutation and is quite anxious\n\nto present the facts & figures in the morning butBrossis away & he can't leave the office:= I consumed the morning in finding the “Globe” & finally succeded in finding one at the Historical Society from whichifit is possible I propose to obtain some statistics this P.M.:= I suppose of course\n\nthe papers will refute it unless indeed they are as Scripps & myself were impressed\n\nwith the belief that it is true; but then<Page 2><Page 3>it behooves all of us to see our Editorial friends & see to it that such refutation\n\nis full clear & distinct and that the charge of lying is retorted on them with a vengeance:=\n\nthe little gentleman Johnson (I believe)3would be an excellent hand to take the “Globe” & collate all the statistics relative\n\nto the appropriations bills & shew how you voted & how others (nowdemocrats) voted on the same questions:= they think they have made a terrible onslaught we\n\nought to return the charge equally as effective:= the devil ought to be fought with\n\nfire:=4Scripps says that neitherSheahannorDouglaswrote it:=5I did not go toWentworthfor his Globe as I was advised thatJohnis willing to see the attack & would not lend his Globe to refute it:= don't let\n\nus lose ground by inattention to these apparently trifling but really formidable matters:=\n\nthe fight is as effectually between you & Douglas as if you were in the field for\n\na popular vote:= “Happy Comparison ARepublicaneditor writing from theSpringfield Republican Conventionto his own paper, described the speech of the Hon. A. Lincoln as abounding in strong\n\narguments, great research, and “happy comparisons.” We know Mr. Lincoln personally,\n\nand have no disposition to say one word having the slightest approach to disrespect,\n\nbut as he has set himself before the people ofIllinoisas the competitor of Senator Douglas, and has not only invited, but actually made\n\ncomparisons between himself and his opponent, we feel warranted in taking notice of\n\nwhat he has said in this particular.7 There are a number of Republicans (as well as several Republican newspapers) who think\n\nthat in a struggle for the defence of theState, and of the Constitution, and of the North, good sense would dictate that a Senator\n\nwho can command support and power with the entire people of the Union, would be of\n\nmore service than a mere individual whose influence would be confined to his own\n\nperson, and whose power would be exhausted by the casting of his own vote. Mr. Lincoln,\n\nin his speech, after pointing out to the Republicans of Illinois the reasons why he,\n\nLincoln, should be elected, turns to the question of whether he or Mr. Douglas would\n\nprove the most serviceable representative in the councils of the nation, and he says\n\n(we give the extract,italics and all, just as we find it published in theSpringfieldJournal:) “There are those who denounce usopenlyto theirownfriends, and yet whisperus softly, thatSenator Douglasis theaptestinstrument there is, with which to effect that object.Theydonottell us, nor hashetold us, that hewishesany such object to be effected. They wish us toinferall, from the facts, that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the\n\ndynasty; and that he has regularly voted with us, on a single point, upon which, he\n\nand we, have never differed. They remind us thatheis a verygreat man, and that the largest ofusare very small ones. Let this be granted. But ‘aliving dogis better than adead lion.8’ Judge Douglas, if not adeadlion,for this work, is at least acagedandtoothlessone. How can he oppose the advances of slavery? He don’tcareanything about it. His avowedmission is impressingthe “public heart” tocarenothing about it.” Mr. Lincoln thinks proper to speak of his competitor as a “dead lion,” and to hold himself up to the people of Illinois as a “living dog.” We have no right to question Mr. Lincoln’s estimation of himself, he has applied\n\nit to himself, and has, to give it stronger significance, italicised the expression in his printed speech. We think that for a “dead lion,” or even a “agedandtoothless” one, Senator Douglas possesses and displays considerable vitality. To kill adeadlion, all the ‘living dogs’ of Illinois have been let loose with sharpened fangs.\n\nTo fight a ‘toothless’ lion all the living dogs from Cairo toChicagohave been lashed and whipped into the hunt. And yet there is not a ‘living dog’\n\nin the entire pack that does not tremble and quake, lest that dead and toothless animal,\n\neven in death, may rise and put him in jeopardy. Was the lion who stood in the pathway\n\nofLecomptonismdead when he bid the entire power and patronage of the Government defiance, and forbid\n\nthe consumation of that iniquity? Was that the voice of a dead lion, which has been heard in the\n\nmountains and valleys ofPennsylvania, upon the streams ofOhio, all over the prairies of the Northwest, even now finds a responsive echo throughout\n\nthe State ofVirginia? Was that the struggle of a dead lion which forced a proud and overbearing majority\n\nin both houses ofCongress, backed by all the power and appliances of the Federal Government, to abandon after\n\na four months’ struggle, their infamous measure, and send theLecompton Constitutionback toKansasto be buried beyond all hope of resurrection by the people of thatTerritory? If that was the power of a dead lion, we would like to know whether there is a\n\n‘living dog’ in Illinois who could have done the same deed! Suppose that Douglas\n\nhad not been in the Senate, and his place had been occupied by a ‘living dog’ in the\n\nperson of Abraham Lincoln, wouldLecomptonhave been delayed one hour in its triumphant passage? Who else than Douglas could have arrested that measure when he did, and as he did?\n\nA new and popular Administration majority in both branches of Congress, the entire\n\npatronage of the Government undisposed of, and yet a man arose up there and bid that\n\nmajority and that Administration to stop in the prosecution of an unjust measure.\n\nCall you, Mr. Lincoln, the man who did that successfully a dead lion—a toothless animal?\n\nAnd pray, when do you ever expect to be able, in the Senate or out of it, any where,\n\nat home or abroad, to approach in power and influence the achievement of a dead lion?\n\nIn that hour, of what avail would have been the barking of a ‘living dog?’9 We remember that on one occasion, some years ago, a bill was pending in theHouse of RepresentativesatWashingtonfor the purchase of medicines and the employment of nurses to attend the sick and\n\ndying American soldiers in the hospitals and camps of hot and burningMexico; when our suffering soldiers—the volunteers of Illinois andIndiana—the men who atBuena Vistahad followedHardinandBissell, and who through the desert had accompaniesShieldsand Foreman—were crying out in their fever for cooling drinks and kind hands to minister to their\n\ndying wants; we know that when the bill to purchase these medicines, and furnish necessaries\n\nfor the American soldiers who were sick and dying was pending, a ‘living dog’ reared\n\nhis ungainly person in the national councils, an din a yelping, barking tone, refused\n\nthem succor! Let them die—let them die, the men of Illinois, who fought over and\n\nrescued the dead body of Hardin, who echoed back the cheering call of Bissell, ofRichardson, ofMoore, ofHarris, let them die. I, a ‘living dog,’ from the state of Illinois, refuse to send these\n\nmen food, clothing or medicine. I, Abram Lincoln. ofSangamon county, refuse to vote one dollar to feed, cloth, or minister to the wants of the sick and\n\ndying volunteers from my own State, who are suffering in Mexico. Let them die like\n\ndogs! Let them die for want of medicine! Let the fever-parched lips of my Illinois\n\nneighbors crack in painful agony—not one drop of cooling liquid shall soothe them\n\nif I can help it. What if they have served their country; what if they have encountered\n\nand beaten back an enemy thrice their own number; what if they do lie on damp grounds\n\nby night, and march in blistering sunlight by day; what if they have proved, every\n\nman of them, to be aLionin his country’s cause, I, Abram Lincoln, am a living dog, and ‘a living dog is\n\nbetter than a dead lion.’ Oh, Mr. Lincoln, the living dog at that day tried his powers with the man who is now\n\nstyled a ‘dead lion;’ you then refused succours to your countrymen in Mexico, but the ‘living dog’ was powerless even for evil.\n\nThe money was voted, and the living dog skulked back into obscurity. Was not that\n\na deed worthy of \"a living dog;\" would not even a dead lion be ashamed that his memory\n\nshould be stained by the record of such an act? Democrats of Illinois, Republicans of Illinois! the man who styles himself a ‘living\n\ndog asks you to support him for the United States Senate. The man who aspires to\n\nbe your representative in the Senate, who offers himself to fill the place heretofore\n\nfilled with such world-wide distinction by Douglas, tells you that he will go there\n\nas a living dog. He has been in Congress before, but who is there outside of the\n\nold settlers of Illinois has any recollection of his service there? What did he do?\n\nWhat did he say? What act is there which has rendered his service or his presence\n\nthere memorable? Who is there in Illinois or in the Union that can remember any act\n\nor speech (other than the one we have mentioned) by Lincoln in the Congress of the\n\nUnited States. He asks you to send him there because he is better than a dead lion.\n\nBut is the lion dead? Why the hostile array then that has been prepared to kill the\n\nlion who is already dead? People of Illinois Mr. Lincoln has stated the issue—‘a living dog’ or a ‘lion’ not\n\ndead, nor wounded, nor toothless, nor caged, but free, bold, firm, strong, and more\n\npowerful than ever. Choose you, as your representative, the man who claims no higher\n\nrank than that of a ‘living dog,’ or the man who has exercised, and forever will exercise\n\na controlling power over the legislation of his country.",

In hisreplyto Medill, Lincoln supplied detailed information to counter theDaily Chicago Times’s attack.Although Lincoln opposed the Mexican War and questioned its constitutionality during\n                  his time in theU.S. House of Representatives, he nevertheless voted in favor of supplies for U.S. troops on at least two occasions:\n                  February 17 and March 8, 1848.
