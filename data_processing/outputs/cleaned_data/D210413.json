Lucas  as a temporary clerk in the Land Office in March\n                  1849, but Lucas was worried about his tenure with rumors swirling that Young was to\n                  be replaced.  Lucas held onto his job through the spring, and he sentAbraham Lincolna steady stream of letters informing Lincoln on the contest for commissioner and\n                  on appointments to land offices throughout Illinois.  Lucas’ name does not appear\n                  in the official register of the officers and agents of the government employed as\n                  of September 30, 1849, so he must have lost his position.  His name also does not\n                  appear in the official registers for 1851 and 1853, so apparently he did not receive\n                  another federal appointment while the Whigs held power.Lincoln sent  Addison the desired letter of recommendation on the second half of aletterwritten on July 22, 1849.  This letter of recommendation has not been located; Addison\n                  presumably tore off the letter of recommendation and used it to advance his efforts\n                  in securing a job.Addison does not appear in the official register of the officers and agents of the\n                  federal government for the year ending September 30, 1849, but there is evidence that\n                  he worked as a clerk at the Department of the Interior from May to November 1849.Abraham Lincoln to George W.
