Lincoln had just returned fromChicago, Illinois. While there he wrote Douglas, asking him to agree to work together to arrange a\n                  series of debates. For the first part of theelection campaign of 1858, Lincoln had often followed Douglas on the  trail, delivering speeches either later\n                  in the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day.

        "text": "3John M. Palmer had endorsed Woods'letterof  July 19 and seconded Wood's request that Lincoln visit Carlinville and deliver\n                  a political speech.If Lincoln penned another reply to Woods, that reply has not been located. LincolnwrotePalmer on August 5, announcing his intention to speak in Carlinville on August 31.\n                  Lincoln did so, and Palmer spoke after him.Douglas eventually agreed to a series of debates with Lincoln, which became the famous\n                  Lincoln-Douglas Debates.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and, in thefederal election of 1858, Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through\n                  his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well\n                  as standing within the national Republican Party.Stephen A.
