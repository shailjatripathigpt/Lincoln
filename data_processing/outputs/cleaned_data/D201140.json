There Larrance showed Lincoln\n                  one of his publications of a map and accompanying diagram, designed to allow a user\n                  to find a location instantly. This publication may have beenLarrance’s Post Office Chart: Diagram of the State of Illinois(Cincinnati: I. A. Pittman, 1858).Larrance’s children also reported that at this November 10, 1858 meeting between Larrance\n                  and Lincoln, Lincoln’s recent electoral loss toStephen A. Douglasin the1858 racefor theU.S. Senatewas mentioned, causing Lincoln to remark: “I did not expect to be elected, I was\n                  killing bigger game.”69Cong.
