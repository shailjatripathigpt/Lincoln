We have had\n\nseveral letters fromOhioto-day, all encouraging. Two of them inform us that Hon.C. B. Smith, on his way here, addressed a larger and more enthusiastic audience, atCincinnati, than has been seen in that city since 1840. Smith himself wrote one of the letters;\n\nand he says the signs are decidedly good.3Letters from the Reserve are of the same character. The tone of the letters—free\n\nfrom despondency—full of hope—is what particularly encourages me. If a man is scared\n\nwhen he writes, I think I can detect it, when I see what he writes.4 I would rather not be put upon explaining howLoganwas defeated in my district. In the first place I have no particulars from there,\n\nmy friends, supposing I am on the road home, not having written me. Whether there\n\nwas a full turn out of the voters I have as yet not learned. The most I can now say\n\nis that a good manyWhigs, without good cause, as I think, were unwilling to go for Logan, and some of them\n\nso wrote me before the election. On the other handHarriswas a Major of thewar, and fought atCerro Gordo, where several Whigs of the district fought with him. These two facts and their\n\neffects, I presume tell the whole story. That there is any political change against\n\nus in the district I cannot believe; because I wrote some time ago to every county\n\nof the district for an account of changes; and, in answer I got the names of four\n\nagainst us, eighty-three for us. I dislike to predict, but it seems to me the district\n\nmust and will be found right side up again in November.5",

He had pledged to serve only one term, but many Whigs\n                  in the district favored his renomination. Lincoln was not averse to running again,\n                  but Stephen T. Logan received the nomination. In August 1848, Logan lost to Thomas\n                  L. Harris in a close race.As for the presidential canvass in November, Lincoln proved prescient: althoughIllinoisas a whole went for Cass, voters in the eleven counties in the Seventh Congressional\n                  District opted for Taylor, casting  8,188 ballots for him, 6,684 for Cass, and  712\n                  forMartin Van Buren, candidate of theFree Soil Party.  Taylor won seven counties, Cass three, and Van Buren one.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:271; Howard W.
