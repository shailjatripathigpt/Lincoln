    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on “A Bill Providing for the Payment of Interest upon\n\nthe Public Debt”,” 11 December 18401 Mr.Peckfrom the committee on finance, to which was referred a bill, introduced by Mr.Hicks, to provide for the payment of interest on the public debt, reported a substitute\n\nfor the bill as an amendment—the same heretofore proposed by the finance committee. Mr.Trumbullmoved to lay the amendment upon the table; which was agreed to, ayes 40, noes 39. Mr.Hardinmoved to amend the bill by adding two additional sections, providing that an additional\n\none tenth of one per cent. should be collected and paid into the State Treasury, to\n\nbe pledged and applied to the payment of interest on the bonds hereby hypothecated,\n\nand those heretofore sold; and restricting the counties to 50 cents on the one hundred\n\ndollars to be levied for county purposes. Mr.Hardinsaid he was anxious to test the sense of theHouse, on the measure proposed in the amendment—that of a direct tax. He was for adopting\n\nsome permanent measure for the payment of this interest.—We had been together for\n\nnear three weeks, and notwithstanding theGovernor, had told us, that this was the only democratic mode of raising a tax, yet we had\n\nheard nothing from the dominant party in this House, or from the finance committee\n\non this subject. If this bill passed as proposed by the committee he thought it highly\n\nproblematical, whether any permanent measure would be adopted whatever. The next\n\nstep would be to hypothecate bonds to pay our July and next January interest, which\n\ninterest amounted to about $300,000, and for which about $600,000 in bonds must be\n\nhypothecated, and these bonds would eventually become forfeited and be sold for 40\n\nor 50 cents on the dollar. Were gentlemen determined to pursue this ruinous policy,\n\nrather than take the responsibility of coming up to the question of a direct tax?\n\nWe were chosen to represent the interests and honor of theStatefor two years, and we should make some provision, that would sustain that honor so\n\nlong as it was in our keeping. We must give some assurance to our creditors, that\n\nwe intend in good faith to pay them. By no other means could our credit be sustained,\n\nand he should vote for no bill, of this character, without an assurance that some\n\nsuch measure as that proposed in the amendment, would be adopted. He called upon\n\nthechairman of the finance committeeand the majority in this House, to come forward with their propositions to relieve\n\nand sustain the country. They had the power to adjournsine die, or make fat offices for themselves, at half a days warning; but they had not yet\n\nhad the power to make known their policy to the country. Mr.Lincolnsaid he was already committed to the principle contained in the amendment proposed\n\nby thegentlemanfromMorgan. The only difference between themeasurehe had formerly proposed, and that now proposed by thegentleman, was that by his plan, a provision was made for increasing our means for defraying\n\nthe ordinary expenses of the State, as well as to meet our accruing interest. It\n\nwas just as bad to be bankrupt in one respect as in the other, and while we were adjusting\n\nthe one, the other had as well be attended to at the same time. Mr.Hardinmodified his amendment, as the suggestion of Mr. Lincoln, so as to provide, that\n\nthe surplus if any, should go into the State treasury for ordinary expenses. Mr.Parsonsspoke against the amendment and in favor of the original bill. Under other circumstances\n\nhe would not vote for the bill reported by the finance committee. As a representative\n\nhe believed it was wrong to pay interest on money, which we had never received. But\n\nthe time was now so short, in which provisions could be made for meeting our interest\n\nin January, that he felt he should not be justifiable in longer opposing the bill.\n\nIf this interest was not paid at the time, the credit of the State was gone. Our\n\npresent action was of the utmost importance not only to the present, but to future\n\ngenerations. This was a sovereign State—should we proclaim her bankrupt to the world?—There\n\nwere those who were striving to ruin our credit abroad. We had heard much of our\n\n“blighted” and “withered” prospects.—Why were these terms used in reference to a State\n\nas exhaustless in her resources as Illinois? He believed she was yet destined to be\n\nthe granary of the world. He acknowledged his responsibility to his constitueuts,\n\nbut he believed he represented an high-minded and honorable community, who would not\n\nconsent, that the character of the State should be tarnished. Mr.Englishmoved to lay the bill and amendment on the table; lost, ayes 37, noes 39. Mr.Cavarlymoved to lay the amendment on the table, which was carried, ayes 40, noes 38. Mr.Cavarlythen offered an amendment, providing that all the revenue arising from real estate\n\nshould go into the State treasury, and so much as was necessary should be pledged\n\nfor the interest on our bonds. Messrs. Cavalry,MurphyofCook,McClernand,OrmsbeeandHenderson, discussed the amendment. The ayes and noes were taken and it was lost, aye 1, noes\n\n83.",
