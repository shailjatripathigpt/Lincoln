Land in the\n                  second class, being alternate sections reserved for grants to railroads, had a minimum\n                  price of $2.50 per acre.According to Thomas Meharry, the land in question consisted of land that he purchased\n                  in November 1855 in section thirty-three of township number eighteen north, range\n                  nine east in Champaign County as well as land that his brother James owned in the\n                  west half of the west half of section fifteen of township eighteen north, range nine\n                  east in Champaign County. Public land sales records confirm James Meharry’s ownership\n                  of the land that Thomas specified, and shows the land was valued at $3.55 per acre.\n                  However, public land sales records do not contain an account of Thomas Meharry having\n                  purchased any lands in section thirty-three of township number eighteen north, range\n                  nine east in Champaign County. Yet there are records that Thomas purchased more than\n                  500 acres of land in sections five, seven, and nine  of township number seventeen\n                  north, range nine east of Champaign County in November 1855. This land was valued\n                  at between $5.31 and $5.53 per acre. It is also possible that records for some of\n                  his purchases of public lands  are no longer extant.J.
