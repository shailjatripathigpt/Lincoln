HaywroteLincoln at least one more letter related to politics in 1858.In a July 26 letter to Lincoln, James I. Ferree wrote that he was mistaken in previously telling Lincoln\n                  that his impression was thatMorris (Maurice) B. Brownwas a man who “could be purchased by the Democracy.” After getting to know Brown\n                  through canvassing, Ferree wrote, he believed Brown to be “a strong Republican.” Despite\n                  Hay’s assertion above that Brown had “no sympathy with the Republican Party,” the\n                  party ran Brown in the state elections of 1858 as its candidate for the Ninth Illinois\n                  House District’s seat in theIllinois General Assembly. Ultimately, however, he lost to DemocratJohn G. Powell. The Republican Party never ran Ferree as a candidate in the elections of 1858. The\n                  Democratic Party did not run Edwin B. Webb as a candidate; he died in October, prior\n                  to the elections.Lincoln was attentive to the state legislative races in 1858 because, at the time,\n                  he was running as the Illinois Republican Party’s candidate to supplant incumbent\n                  Stephen A. Douglas in theU.S. Senateand members of the Illinois General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in the U.S. Senate. There is no evidence that either Lincoln or Lyman Trumbull delivered\n                  political addresses in any of the towns Hay names above, potentially because southern\n                  Illinois was a Democratic stronghold and both Lincoln and Douglas focused the bulk\n                  of their campaigns on the more competitive battleground of central Illinois.Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois in the local elections of\n                  1858, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  and Douglas  ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate.  The campaign, however,\n                  and in particular theLincoln-Douglas Debates, catapulted Lincoln onto the national political scene, setting the stage for the1860 Federal Election.
