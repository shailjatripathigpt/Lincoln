        "text": "2No letter from Abraham Lincoln to Turner to which this is a response has been found.\n                  Turner may have been responding to a letter from Lincoln similar to those that Lincoln\n                  wrote to other newly-elected members of theIllinois General Assemblyin November and December of 1854 soliciting their support for his potential candidacy\n                  forU.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate. In the first two rounds of voting, Turner, speaker of the Illinois\n                  House of Representatives, cast his vote for Lincoln. Turner cast no votes in the third\n                  through the ninth rounds of balloting. After nine rounds of voting no candidate had\n                  achieved a majority of votes, and with his own share of votes declining Lincoln dropped\n                  out and urged his supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. Turner rejoined\n                  the voting in the tenth and final round to cast his ballot for Trumbull, who won.\n                  See the1854 Federal Election.Abraham Lincoln to Thomas J.
