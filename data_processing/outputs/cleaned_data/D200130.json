Lincoln, Esq. for the Lecture delivered by kim this evening, and that he be solicited to furnish a copy for publication.” Attest; As a subject for the remarks of the evening,the perpetuation of our political institutions, is selected. In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American People, find\n\nour account running, under date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era.—We\n\nfind ourselves in the peaceful possession, of the fairest portion of the earth, as\n\nregards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate. We find\n\nourselves under the government of a system of political institutions, conducing more\n\nessentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty, than any of which the history\n\nof former times tells us. We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves\n\nthe legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled not in the acquirement\n\nor establishment of them—they are a legacy bequeathed us, by aoncehardy, brave, and patriotic, butnowlamented and departed race of ancestors. Their’s was the task (and nobly they performed\n\nit) to possess themselves, and through themselves, us, of this goodly land; and to\n\nuprear upon its hills and its valleys, a political edifice of liberty and equal rights;\n\n’tis ours only, to transmit these, the former, unprofaned by the foot of an invader;\n\nthe latter, undecayed by the lapse of time, and untorn . . .[by usurpation—to the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know.\n\nThis task of gratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity]3, and love for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully to perform. How, then, shall we perform it?—At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?\n\nBy what means shall we fortify against it?—Shall we expect some transatlantic military\n\ngiant, to step the Ocean, and crush us at a blow? Never!—All the armies ofEurope,AsiaandAfricacombined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military\n\nchest; with a Buonaparte for a commander,4could not by force, take a drink from theOhio, or make a track on theBlue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever\n\nreach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction\n\nbe our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen,\n\nwe must live through all time, or die by suicide. I hope I am over wary; but if I am not, there is, even now, something of ill-omen,\n\namongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country; the\n\ngrowing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions, in lieu of the sober\n\njudgement of Courts; and the worse than savage mobs, for the executive ministers of justice.\n\nThis disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now exists in ours,\n\nthough grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth, and an\n\ninsult to our inteligence, to deny. Accounts of outrages committed by mobs, form the every day news of the\n\ntimes. They have pervaded the country, fromNew EnglandtoLouisiana;—they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning suns\n\nof the latter;—they are not the creature of climate—neither are they confined to the\n\nslave-holding, or the non-slave-holding States. Alike, they spring up among the pleasure\n\nhunting masters of Southern slaves, and the order loving citizens of the land of steady\n\nhabits.—Whatever, then, their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.5 It would be tedious, as well as useless, to recount the horrors of all of them. Those\n\nhappening in the State ofMississippi, and atSt. Louis, are, perhaps, the most dangerous in example, and revolting to humanity. In the\n\nMississippi case, they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers; a set of\n\nmen, certainly not following for a livelihood, a very useful, or very honest occupation;\n\nbut one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually lisensed by an act of theLegislature, passed but a single year before. Next, negroes, suspected of conspiring to raise\n\nan insurrection, were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State: then, white\n\nmen, supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers, from neighboring\n\nStates, going thither on business, were, in many instances, subjected to the same\n\nfate. Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes\n\nto white citizens, and from these to strangers; till, dead men were seen literally\n\ndangling from the boughs of trees upon every road side; and in numbers almost sufficient,\n\nto rival the native Spanish moss of the country, as a drapery of the forest.6 Turn, then, to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis. A single victim was only\n\nsacrificed there. His story is very short; and is, perhaps, the most highly tragic,\n\nof any thing of its length, that has ever been witnessed in real life. A mulatto\n\nman, by the name ofMcIntosh, was seized in the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree,\n\nand actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time he had been\n\na freeman, attending to his own business, and at peace with the world.7 Such are the effects of mob law; and such are the scenes, becoming more and more frequent\n\nin this land so lately famed for love of law and order; and the stories of which,\n\nhave even now grown too familiar, to attract any thing more, than an idle remark. But you are, perhaps, ready to ask, “What has this to do with the perpetuation of\n\nour political institutions?” I answer, it has much to do with it. Its direct consequences\n\nare, comparatively speaking, but a small evil; and much of its danger consists, in\n\nthe proneness of our minds, to regard its direct, as its only consequences. Abstractly\n\nconsidered, the hanging of the gamblers atVicksburg, was of but little consequence. They constitute a portion of population, that is\n\nworse than useless in a . . .8example be set by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one. If they\n\nwere annually swept, from the stage of existence, by the plague or small pox, honest\n\nmen would, perhaps, be much profited, by the operation.—Similar too, is the correct\n\nreasoning, in regard to the burning of the negro at St. Louis. He had forfeited his\n\nlife, by the perpetration of an outrageous murder, upon one of the most worthy and\n\nrespectable citizens of the city; and had he not died as he did, he must have died\n\nby the sentence of the law, in a very short time afterwards. As to him alone, it\n\nwas as well the way it was, as it could otherwise have been.—But the example in either\n\ncase, was fearful.—When men take it in their heads to day, to hang gamblers, or burn\n\nmurderers, they should recollect, that, in the confusion usually attending such transactions,\n\nthey will be as likely to hang or burn some one, who is neither a gambler nor a murdererone who is; and that, acting upon thethey set, the mob of tomorrow, may, and probably will, hang or burn some of them,9very same mistake. And not only so; the innocent, those who have ever set their faces\n\nagainst violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty, fall victims to the\n\nravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by step, till all the walls erected\n\nfor the defence of the persons and property of individuals, are trodden down, and disregarded. But\n\nall this even, is not the full extent of the evil.—By such examples, by instances\n\nof the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit, are encouraged\n\nto become lawless in practice; and having been used to no restraint, but dread of\n\npunishment, they thus become, absolutely unrestrained.—Having ever regarded Government\n\nas their deadliest bane, they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations;\n\nand pray for nothing so much, as its total annihilation. While, on the other hand,\n\ngood men, men who love tranquility, who desire to abide by the laws, and enjoy their\n\nbenefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defence of their country; seeing their property destroyed; their families insulted, and their\n\nlives endangered; their persons injured; and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes\n\na change for the better; become tired of, and disgusted with, a Government that offers\n\nthem no protection; and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they\n\nhave nothing to lose. Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit, which\n\nall must admit, is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of any Government,\n\nand particularly of those constituted like ours, may effectually be broken down and\n\ndestroyed—I mean theattachmentof the People. Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the vicious\n\nportion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands,\n\nand burn churches, ravage and rob provision stores, throw printing presses into rivers,\n\nshoot editors,10and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure, and with impunity; depend on it,\n\nthis Government cannot last. By such things, the feelings of the best citizens will\n\nbecome more or less alienated from it; and thus it will be left without friends, or\n\nwith too few, and those few too weak, to make their friendship effectual. At such\n\na time and under such circumstances, men of sufficient ta. . .to seize . . .11, which for the last half century, has been the fondest hope, of the lovers of freedom,\n\nthroughout the world. I know the American People aremuchattached to their Government;—I know they would suffermuchfor its sake;—I know they would endure evils long and patiently, before they would\n\never think of exchanging it for another. Yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws\n\nbe continually despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons\n\nand property, are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the alienation\n\nof their affections from the Government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner\n\nor later, it must come. Here then, is one point at which danger may be expected. The question recurs “how shall we fortify against it?” The answer is simple. Let\n\nevery American, every lover of liberty, every well wisher to his posterity, swear\n\nby the blood of theRevolution, never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country; and never to\n\ntolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support\n\nof the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and Laws,\n\nlet every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor;—let every\n\nman remember that to violate the law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and\n\nto tear the character of his own, and his children’s liberty. Let reverence for the\n\nlaws, be breathed by every American mother, to the lisping babe, that prattles on\n\nher lap—let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and im colleges;—let it be written in Primmers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it\n\nbe preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts\n\nof justice. And, in short, let it become thepolitical religionof the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and\n\nthe gay, of all sexes and tongues, and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly\n\nupon its altars. While ever a state of feeling, such as this, shall universally, or even, very generally\n\nprevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort, and fruitless every attempt,\n\nto subvert our national freedom. When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me not be understood\n\nas saying there are no bad laws; nor that grievances may not arise, for the redress\n\nof which, no legal provisions have been made.—I mean to say no such thing. But I\n\ndo mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon\n\nas possible, still while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should\n\nbe religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let proper\n\nlegal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay; but, till then, let\n\nthem if not too intolerable, be borne with. There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any case that\n\narises, as for instance, the promulgation ofabolitionism, one of two positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right within itself,\n\nand therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens; or, it is\n\nwrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments; and in neither case,\n\nis the interposition of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable. But, it may be asked, why suppose danger to our political institutions? Have we not\n\npreserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not for fifty times as long? We hope there isno sufficientreason. We hope all dangers may be overcome; but to conclude that no danger may\n\never arise, would itself be extremely dangerous. There are now, and will hereafter\n\nbe, many causes, dangerous in their tendency, which have not existed heretofore; and\n\nwhich are not too insignificant to merit attention. That our government should have\n\nbeen maintained in its original form from its establishment until now, is not much\n\nto be wondered at. It had many props to support it through that period, which now\n\nare now decayed, and crumbled away. Through that period, it was felt by all, to be\n\nan undecided experiment; now, it is understood to be a successful one.—Then, all that\n\nsought celebrity and fame, and distinction, expected to find them in the success of\n\nthat experiment. Theirallwas staked upon it:—their destiny wasinseparablylinked with it. Their ambition aspired to display before an admiring world, a practical\n\ndemonstration of the truth of a proposition, which had hitherto been considered, at\n\nbest no better, than problematical; namely,the capability of a people to govern themselves. If they succeeded, they were to be immortalized: their names were to be transferred\n\nto counties and cities, and rivers and mountains; and to be revered and sung, and\n\ntoasted through all time. If they failed, they were to be called knaves and fools,\n\nand fanatics for a fleeting hour; then to sink and be forgotten. They succeeded.\n\nThe experiment is successful; and thousands have won their deathless names in making\n\nit so. But the game is caught; and I believe it is true, that with the crtching, end the pleasures of the chase. This field of glory is harvested, and the crop\n\nis already appropriated. But new reapers will arise, andthey, too, will seek a field. It is to deny, what the history of the world tells us is\n\ntrue, to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst\n\nus. And, when they do, they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling\n\npassion, as others havesodone before them. The question then, is, can that gratification be found in supporting\n\nand maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most certainly it cannot.\n\nMany great and good men sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake,\n\nmay ever be found, whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat inCongress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair;but such belong not to the family of the lion, or the tribe of the eagle, What! think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon?12—Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored.—It\n\nseesno distinctionin adding story to story, upon the monuments of fame, erected to the memory of others.\n\nItdeniesthat it is glory enough to serve under any chief. Itscornsto tread in the footsteps ofanypredecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and, if\n\npossible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves, or enslaving\n\nfreemen. Is it unreasonable then to expect, that some man possessed of the loftiest\n\ngenius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, will at\n\nsome time, spring up among us? And when such a one does, it will require the people\n\nto be united with each other, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent,\n\nto successfully frustrate his designs. Distinction will be his paramount object; and although he would as willingly, perhaps\n\nmore so, acquire it by doing good as harm; yet, that opportunity being past, and nothing\n\nleft to be done in the way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling\n\ndown. Here then, is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such a one as could not have\n\nwell existed heretofore. Another reason whichonce was; but which, to the same extent, isnow no more, has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far. I mean the powerful influence\n\nwhich the interesting scenes of the revolution had upon thepassionsof the people as distinguished from their judgment. By this influence, the jealousy,\n\nenvy, and avarice, incident to our nature, and so common to a state of peace, prosperity,\n\nand conscious strength, were, for the time, in a great measure smothered and rendered\n\ninactive; while the deep rooted principles ofhate, and the powerful motive ofrevenge, instead of being turned against each other, were directed exclusively against the\n\nBritish nation. And thus, from the force of circumstances, the basest principles\n\nof our nature, were either made to lie dormant, or to become the active agents in\n\nthe advancement of the noblest of cause—that of establishing and maintaining civil\n\nand religious liberty. But this state of feelingmust fade,is fading,has faded, with the circumstances that produced it. I do not mean to say, that the scenes of the revolutionare noworever will beentirely forgotten; but that like every thing else, they must fade upon the memory\n\nof the world, and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time. In history, we hope,\n\nthey will be read of, and recounted, so long as the bible shall be read;—but even\n\ngranting that they will, their influencecannot bewhat it heretofore has been. Even then, theycannot beso universally known, nor so vividly felt, as they were by the generation just gone\n\nto rest. At the close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had been a participator\n\nin some of its scenes. The consequence was, that of those scenes, in the form of\n\na husband, a father, a son or a brother, aliving historywas to be found in every family—a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of\n\nits own authenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in the\n\nmidst of the very scenes related—a history, too, that could be read and understood\n\nalike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned.—Butthosehistories are gone. Theycanbe read no more forever. Theywerea fortress of strength; but, what invading foemen couldnever do, the silent artillery of timehas done; the levelling of its walls. They are gone.—Theywerea forest of giant oaks; but the all-resistless hurricane has swept over them, and\n\nleft only, here and there, a lonely trunk, despoiled of its verdure, shorn of its\n\nfoliage; unshading and unshaded, to murmur in a few more gentle breezes, and to combat\n\nwith its mutilated limbs, a few more ruder storms, then to sink, and be no more. Theywerethe pillars of the temple of liberty; and now, that they have crumbled away, that\n\ntemple must fall, unless we, their descendants, supply their places with other pillars,\n\nhewn from the solid quarry of sober reason. Passion has helped us; but can do so\n\nno more. It will in future be our enemy. Reason, cold, calculating, unimpassioned\n\nreason, must furnish all the materials for our future support and defence.—Let those materials be moulded intogeneral intelligence, . . .soundmoralityand, in particular,a reverence for the constitution and laws: and, that we improved to the last; that we remained free to the last; that we revered\n\nhis name to the last; that, during his long sleep, we permitted no hostile foot to\n\npass over or desecrate . . .place; shall be that which to . . .trump shall awaken ourWash13 . . .let the proud fabric of freedom . . .14of its basis; and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution, “the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”Matthew 16:18",

      "and burn churches, ravage and rob provision stores, throw printing presses into rivers,",
      "shoot editors,10and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure, and with impunity; depend on it,",
      "this Government cannot last. By such things, the feelings of the best citizens will",
      "become more or less alienated from it; and thus it will be left without friends, or",
      "with too few, and those few too weak, to make their friendship effectual. At such",
      "a time and under such circumstances, men of sufficient ta. . .to seize . . .11, which for the last half century, has been the fondest hope, of the lovers of freedom,",
      "throughout the world. I know the American People aremuchattached to their Government;—I know they would suffermuchfor its sake;—I know they would endure evils long and patiently, before they would",
      "ever think of exchanging it for another. Yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws",
      "be continually despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons",
      "and property, are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the alienation",
      "of their affections from the Government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner",
      "or later, it must come. Here then, is one point at which danger may be expected. The question recurs “how shall we fortify against it?” The answer is simple. Let",
      "every American, every lover of liberty, every well wisher to his posterity, swear",
      "by the blood of theRevolution, never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country; and never to",
      "tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support",
      "of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and Laws,",
      "let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor;—let every",
      "man remember that to violate the law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and",
      "to tear the character of his own, and his children’s liberty. Let reverence for the",
      "laws, be breathed by every American mother, to the lisping babe, that prattles on",
      "her lap—let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and im colleges;—let it be written in Primmers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it",
      "be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts",
      "of justice. And, in short, let it become thepolitical religionof the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and",
      "the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly",
      "upon its altars. While ever a state of feeling, such as this, shall universally, or even, very generally",
      "prevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort, and fruitless every attempt,",
      "to subvert our national freedom. When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me not be understood",
      "as saying there are no bad laws; nor that grievances may not arise, for the redress",
      "of which, no legal provisions have been made.—I mean to say no such thing. But I",
      "do mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon",
      "as possible, still while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should",
      "be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let proper",
      "legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay; but, till then, let",
      "them if not too intolerable, be borne with. There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any case that",
      "arises, as for instance, the promulgation ofabolitionism, one of two positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right within itself,",
      "and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens; or, it is",
      "wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments; and in neither case,",
      "is the interposition of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable. But, it may be asked, why suppose danger to our political institutions? Have we not",
      "preserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not for fifty times as long? We hope there isno sufficientreason. We hope all dangers may be overcome; but to conclude that no danger may",
      "ever arise, would itself be extremely dangerous. There are now, and will hereafter",
      "be, many causes, dangerous in their tendency, which have not existed heretofore; and",
      "which are not too insignificant to merit attention. That our government should have",
      "been maintained in its original form from its establishment until now, is not much",
      "to be wondered at. It had many props to support it through that period, which now",
      "are now decayed, and crumbled away. Through that period, it was felt by all, to be",
      "an undecided experiment; now, it is understood to be a successful one.—Then, all that",
      "sought celebrity and fame, and distinction, expected to find them in the success of",
      "that experiment. Theirallwas staked upon it:—their destiny wasinseparablylinked with it. Their ambition aspired to display before an admiring world, a practical",
      "demonstration of the truth of a proposition, which had hitherto been considered, at",
      "best no better, than problematical; namely,the capability of a people to govern themselves. If they succeeded, they were to be immortalized: their names were to be transferred",
      "to counties and cities, and rivers and mountains; and to be revered and sung, and",
      "toasted through all time. If they failed, they were to be called knaves and fools,",
      "and fanatics for a fleeting hour; then to sink and be forgotten. They succeeded.",
      "The experiment is successful; and thousands have won their deathless names in making",
      "it so. But the game is caught; and I believe it is true, that with the crtching, end the pleasures of the chase. This field of glory is harvested, and the crop",
      "is already appropriated. But new reapers will arise, andthey, too, will seek a field. It is to deny, what the history of the world tells us is",
      "true, to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst",
      "us. And, when they do, they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling",
      "passion, as others havesodone before them. The question then, is, can that gratification be found in supporting",
      "and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most certainly it cannot.",
      "Many great and good men sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake,",
      "may ever be found, whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat inCongress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair;but such belong not to the family of the lion, or the tribe of the eagle, What! think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon?12—Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored.—It",
      "seesno distinctionin adding story to story, upon the monuments of fame, erected to the memory of others.",
      "Itdeniesthat it is glory enough to serve under any chief. Itscornsto tread in the footsteps ofanypredecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and, if",
      "possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves, or enslaving",
      "freemen. Is it unreasonable then to expect, that some man possessed of the loftiest",
      "genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, will at",
      "some time, spring up among us? And when such a one does, it will require the people",
      "to be united with each other, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent,",
      "to successfully frustrate his designs. Distinction will be his paramount object; and although he would as willingly, perhaps",
      "more so, acquire it by doing good as harm; yet, that opportunity being past, and nothing",
      "left to be done in the way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling",
      "down. Here then, is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such a one as could not have",
      "well existed heretofore. Another reason whichonce was; but which, to the same extent, isnow no more, has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far. I mean the powerful influence",
      "which the interesting scenes of the revolution had upon thepassionsof the people as distinguished from their judgment. By this influence, the jealousy,",
      "envy, and avarice, incident to our nature, and so common to a state of peace, prosperity,",
      "and conscious strength, were, for the time, in a great measure smothered and rendered",
      "inactive; while the deep rooted principles ofhate, and the powerful motive ofrevenge, instead of being turned against each other, were directed exclusively against the",
      "British nation. And thus, from the force of circumstances, the basest principles",
      "of our nature, were either made to lie dormant, or to become the active agents in",
      "the advancement of the noblest of cause—that of establishing and maintaining civil",
      "and religious liberty. But this state of feelingmust fade,is fading,has faded, with the circumstances that produced it. I do not mean to say, that the scenes of the revolutionare noworever will beentirely forgotten; but that like every thing else, they must fade upon the memory",
      "of the world, and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time. In history, we hope,",
      "they will be read of, and recounted, so long as the bible shall be read;—but even",
      "granting that they will, their influencecannot bewhat it heretofore has been. Even then, theycannot beso universally known, nor so vividly felt, as they were by the generation just gone",
      "to rest. At the close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had been a participator",
      "in some of its scenes. The consequence was, that of those scenes, in the form of",
      "a husband, a father, a son or a brother, aliving historywas to be found in every family—a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of",
      "its own authenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in the",
      "midst of the very scenes related—a history, too, that could be read and understood",
      "alike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned.—Butthosehistories are gone. Theycanbe read no more forever.

      "with its mutilated limbs, a few more ruder storms, then to sink, and be no more. Theywerethe pillars of the temple of liberty; and now, that they have crumbled away, that",

In\n                  June, rumors of a imminent slave revolt began circulating  in Madison County, prompting\n                  a mob on July 2 to hang slaves suspected of conspiring in the plot and, two days later,\n                  hang two supposed white accomplices.  Fear, panic, and subsequent mob violence spread\n                  to Hinds, Warren, and other counties.  By mid-July, approximately twelve white men\n                  and countless African-Americans had fallen victim to vigilantism.Coinciding with the slave insurrection scare was an attack on professional gamblers\n                  inVicksburg.  Ordinary citizens resented the gamblers, and tensions reached its peak at the July\n                  4th celebration, when an altercation occurred, prompting citizens the next day to\n                  post a notice calling for the gamblers to leave within twenty-four hours.  The gamblers\n                  ignored this notice, and on July 6, a mob led by the local militia surrounded their\n                  establishment.  Someone forced the door, the crowd rushed in, and the gamblers opened\n                  fire, killing Hugh Bodley, a young physician.  The mob subsequently captured and hanged\n                  five gamblers.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 25 July 1835, 1:4; 1 August 1835, 2:2-3;Niles’ Weekly Register(Baltimore, MD), 25 July 1835, 363:1; 1 August 1835, 377:1-2; Edwin A.

Those\n               happening in the State ofMississippi, and atSt. Louis, are, perhaps, the most dangerous in example, and revolting to humanity.  In the\n               Mississippi case, they first commenced by hanging  the regular gamblers; a set of\n               men, certainly not following for a livelihood, a very useful, or very honest occupation;\n               but one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually lisensed by an act of theLegislature, passed but a single year before.  Next, negroes, suspected of conspiring to raise\n               an insurrection, were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State: then, white\n               men, supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers, from neighboring\n               States, going thither on business, were, in many instances, subjected to the same\n               fate.  Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes\n               to white citizens, and from these to strangers; till, dead men were seen literally\n               dangling from the boughs of trees upon every road side; and in numbers almost sufficient,\n               to rival the native Spanish moss of the country, as a drapery of the forest.6"

        "text": "But you are, perhaps, ready to ask, “What has this to do with the perpetuation of\n               our political institutions?” I answer, it has much to do with it.  Its direct consequences\n               are, comparatively speaking, but a small evil; and much of its danger consists, in\n               the proneness of our minds, to regard its direct, as its only consequences.  Abstractly\n               considered, the hanging of the gamblers atVicksburg, was of but little consequence.  They constitute a portion of  population, that is\n               worse than useless in a . . .[ny community; and their death, if no pernicious]8example be set by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one.  If they\n               were annually swept, from the stage of existence, by the plague or small pox, honest\n               men would, perhaps, be much profited, by the operation.—Similar too, is the correct\n               reasoning, in regard to the burning of the negro at St. Louis.  He had forfeited his\n               life, by the perpetration of an outrageous murder, upon one of the most worthy and\n               respectable citizens of the city; and had he not died as he did, he must have died\n               by the sentence of the law, in a very short time afterwards.  As to him alone, it\n               was as well the way it was, as it could otherwise have been.—But the example in either\n               case, was fearful.—When men take it in their heads to day, to hang gamblers, or burn\n               murderers, they should recollect, that, in the confusion usually attending such transactions,\n               they will be as likely to hang or burn some one, who is neither a gambler nor a murderer[as]one who is; and that, acting upon the[example]they set, the mob of tomorrow, may, and probably will, hang or burn some of them,[by the]9very same mistake. And not only so; the innocent, those who have ever set their faces\n               against violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty, fall victims to the\n               ravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by step, till all the walls erected\n               for the defence of the persons and property of individuals, are trodden down, and disregarded.  But\n               all this even, is not the full extent of the evil.—By such examples, by instances\n               of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit, are encouraged\n               to become lawless in practice; and having been used to no restraint, but dread of\n               punishment, they thus become, absolutely unrestrained.—Having ever regarded Government\n               as their deadliest bane, they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations;\n               and pray for nothing so much, as its total annihilation.  While, on the other hand,\n               good men, men who love tranquility, who desire to abide by the laws, and enjoy their\n               benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defence of their country; seeing their property destroyed; their families insulted, and their\n               lives endangered; their persons injured; and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes\n               a change for the better; become tired of, and disgusted with, a Government that offers\n               them no protection; and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they\n               have nothing to lose.  Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit, which\n               all must admit, is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of any Government,\n               and particularly of those constituted like ours, may effectually be broken down and\n               destroyed—I mean theattachmentof the People.  Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the vicious\n               portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands,\n               and burn churches, ravage and rob provision stores, throw printing presses into rivers,\n               shoot editors,10and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure, and with impunity; depend on it,\n               this Government cannot last.  By such things, the feelings of the best citizens will\n               become more or less alienated from it; and thus it will be left without friends, or\n               with too few, and those few too weak, to make their friendship effectual.  At such\n               a time and under such circumstances, men of sufficient ta[lent]. . .[and ambition  will not be wanting]to seize . . .[the opportunity, strike the blow, and overturn that fair fabric]11, which for the last half century, has been the fondest hope, of the lovers of freedom,\n               throughout the  world."

That our government should have\n               been maintained in its original form from its establishment until now, is not much\n               to be wondered at.  It had many props to support it through that  period, which now\n               are now decayed, and crumbled away.  Through that period, it was felt by all, to be\n               an undecided experiment; now, it is understood to be a successful one.—Then, all that\n               sought celebrity and fame, and distinction, expected to find them in the success of\n               that experiment.

If they succeeded, they were to be immortalized: their names were to be transferred\n               to counties and cities, and rivers and mountains; and to be revered and sung, and\n               toasted through all time.  If they failed, they were to be called knaves and fools,\n               and fanatics for a fleeting hour; then to sink and be forgotten.

And, when they do, they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling\n               passion, as others havesodone before them.   The question then, is, can that gratification be found in supporting\n               and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others?  Most certainly it cannot.\n               Many great and good men sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake,\n               may ever be found, whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat inCongress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair;but such belong not to the family of the lion, or the tribe of the eagle, What! think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon?12—Never!
