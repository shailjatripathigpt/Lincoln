        "text": "2Lincoln references the movement to draft Zachary Taylor as the Whig Party’s candidate\n                  in thepresidential election of 1848.Lincoln had been actively working to advance Taylor’s candidacy as a member of the\n                  so-called “Young Indians,” a Whig Executive Committee founded byTruman Smithin the spring of 1847 to provide the Whig Party with a unified national organization\n                  for the imminent presidential campaign.  Including principally but not exclusively\n                  Southern Whigs, the Young Indians made it their goal to nominate Zachary Taylor as\n                  the Whig Party standard bearer in 1848.  Some Whigs condemned the movement for Taylor,\n                  a southern slaveholder who had no previous political affiliation, as an abandonment\n                  of Whig principles.  Taylor’s insistence on an independent candidacy, separate from\n                  party affiliation, further eroded his following among the party faithful, includingHenry Clay, the party’s standard bearer in the1844 electionand was still the nominal head of the party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:275-76; Holman Hamilton,Zachary Taylor: Soldier in the White House(Hamden, CT: Archon, 1966), 63-64; Michael F.

        "text": "3On June 9, 1848, the Whig National Convention nominated Taylor as its candidate for\n                  president.  Lincoln’s prognostications about the impact of Taylor’s candidacy, however,\n                  for Whig fortunes in Illinois and Virginia proved erroneous.  After the congressional\n                  elections in August, the party affiliations of the Illinois congressional delegation\n                  remained constant from that in 1846: six Democrats, and one Whig.  Edward D. Baker,\n                  representing the Sixth Congressional District, became the lone Whig in the Illinois\n                  contingent.  Lincoln’s own seat in the Seventh Congressional District, normally a\n                  safe seat for the Whigs, went to DemocratThomas L. Harris.   In the presidential contest, Illinois, like the rest of the Old Northwest, went\n                  Democrat, givingLewis Cass, the Democratic candidate, 44.9% of the vote to 42.4% for Taylor and 12.6 % forMartin Van Buren, candidate of theFree Soil Party.  Virginia also went for Cass, giving him an outright majority with 50.8% of the\n                  vote to 49.2% for Taylor.  The Whigs made slight inroads into the Democratic majority;\n                  in 1844,James K. Polkreceived 50,679 (53%) votes to 44,860 (47%) for Clay, while in 1848, Cass received\n                  46,739 to 45,265 for Taylor. The Whigs in Virginia actually lost three seats in Congress,\n                  and Flournoy himself was unsuccessful in his bid for another term.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A. Lacey, eds.,Illinois Elections, 1818-1990(Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1992), 8, 121-23,\n                     126; John L. Moore, Jon P.
