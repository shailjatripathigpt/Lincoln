        "text": "2Harry E. Pratt, author ofThe Personal Finances of Abraham Lincoln, claims that, on November 28, 1851, Lincoln loaned Cantrall $600 under the conditions\n                  that it be repaid within two years and was subject to an interest rate of ten percent\n                  per year. Pratt also claims that, to secure this loan, Lincoln assumed a mortgage\n                  on eighty acres of land that Cantrall owned inMenard County, Illinoisand that Lincoln released this mortgage on the same day that this November 29, 1852\n                  promissory note for $660 was created. The 1851 promissory note and mortgage document\n                  Pratt refers to have not been located.Also on November 29, 1852, Cantrall and his wife,Elizabeth W. Cantrall, mortgaged 160 acres of land in Menard County to Lincoln as security on the repayment of the\n                  new debt. After a series of payments were made, the debt was finally cleared on June\n                  22,1858, two years after Thomas Cantrall’s death. His brother, Charles S. Cantrall,\n                  who was the administrator of his estate, made the final payment, and, on October 29,\n                  1858, the deed on the land was released back to the Cantrall family.Harry E.
