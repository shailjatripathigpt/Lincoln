        "text": "1This telegram is attributed to Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing but is not written\n                  in Ewing’s hand. On September 20, 1849, Ewing sent Abraham Lincoln a telegram in Springfield,\n                  Illinois while Lincoln was inTremont, Illinois, informing him of his appointment as governor of theOregon Territory. This telegram has not been located. But, as Lincoln explained in aletterdated September 23, he asked a friend in Springfield to reply to Ewing immediately\n                  via telegraph declining the position. That friend did not telegraph Ewing as requested,\n                  fearing Lincoln was declining the position in haste. This led Ewing to send this telegram\n                  to Springfield, asking whether Lincoln was in town to respond. The recipient of this\n                  telegram is unknown, but once Lincoln learned of this telegram he traveled back to\n                  Springfield, sent atelegramto Ewing himself, and wrote Ewing aletterexplaining this sequence of events.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 20 September 1849,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1849-09-20; 25 September 1849,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1849-09-25; Paul I.

        "text": "2Prior to offering Lincoln appointment as governor of the Oregon Territory, President\n                  Zachary Taylor’s administration had offered Lincoln appointment as secretary of the\n                  Oregon Territory, an appointment which Lincoln also declined. The administration offered\n                  Lincoln both positions soon after Taylor appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both  Taylor and Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln a political\n                  appointment in the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and\n                  prevent additional attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. Lincoln  seriously considered\n                  accepting the governorship of the Oregon Territory, but ultimately declined the position,\n                  at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. In the end, Taylor appointed Edward\n                  Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory andJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory.Appointment of Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Territory of Oregon; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250."
