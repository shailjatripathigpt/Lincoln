He forgets that the\n\n“people,” as he complacently calls only those who voted forBuchaaan, are in a minority of the whole people, by about four hundred thousand voters— one\n\nfull tenth of all the voters.5Remembering this, he might perceive that the “Rebuke” may not be quite as durable\n\nas he seems to think— that the majority may not choose to remain permanently rebuked\n\nby that minority. The President thinks the great body of us Fremonters, being ardently attached to liberty,\n\nin the abstract, were duped by a few wicked and designing men. There is a slight\n\ndifference of opinion on this. We thinkhe, being ardently attached to the hope of a second term,in the concrete, was duped by men who had liberty every way.

That “central idea” in our political\n\npublic opinion, at the beginning was, and until recently has continued to be, “the\n\nequality of men.”9And although it was always submitted patiently to whatever of inequality there seemed\n\nto be as matter of actual necessity, its constant working has been a steady progress\n\ntowards the practical equality of all men. The late Presidential election was a struggle,\n\nby oneparty, to discard that central idea, and to substitute for it the opposite idea that slavery\n\nis right, in the abstract, the workings of which, as a central idea, may be the perpetuity\n\nof human slavery, and its extension to all countries and colors.

In the\n                  paper’s March 11 edition, the editors argued that if the Democratic Party succeeded\n                  in electing a Democrat as president in the 1856 federal election, it would also succeed\n                  in “maintaining the affirmative of the great issue of State equality.”Article four, sections three and four of the U.S. Constitution stipulate that all\n                  states within the Union are formed and admitted to the Union on equal terms and guaranteed\n                  the same rights to a republican form of government, protection against invasion, and\n                  protection against domestic violence. Southern Democrats in particular touted the\n                  concept of equality of states in the years leading up to the Civil War, asserting\n                  that the North sought to infringe upon the southern states’ equal rights as they related\n                  to the institution of slavery. Pierce used this argument in his December 2 address\n                  to Congress when he declared that, through their election of Buchanan to the presidency,\n                  the people of the United States had asserted state equality.Richmond Enquirer(VA), 11 March 1856, 2:1; U.S. Const. art.

In a letter-writing campaign to some in Illinois that\n                  he believed supported Fillmore, Lincoln argued that Fillmore stood no chance of success\n                  in Illinois and that therefore Fillmore supporters should cast their ballots for Fremont\n                  rather than waste a vote on Fillmore.

But, in the late contest we were divided betweenFremontandFillmore.11Can we not come together, for the future.  Let every one who really believes, and is resolved, that free society is not,and shall not be, a failure, and who can conscientiously declare that in the past contest he has done\n                  only what he thought best— let every such one have charity to believe that every other\n                  one can say as much.  Thus let bygones be bygones.  Let past differences, as nothing\n                  be; and with steady eye on the real issue, let us reinaugurate the good old “central\n                  ideas” of the Republic.  Wecando it.  The human heartiswith us— God is with us.  We shall again be able not to declare, that “all States\n                  as States, are equal,” nor yet that “all citizens as citizens are equal,” but to renew\n                  the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that “allmenare created equal.”"
