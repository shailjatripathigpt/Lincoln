In making this allegation, Douglas mistakenly quoted a more radical\n                  platform passed at a Republican meeting inAurorathat same year rather than the actual Springfield platform. Douglas also posed a\n                  series of questions to Lincoln in Ottawa aimed at forcing Lincoln to endorse or repudiate\n                  the antislavery positions of the Aurora platform. In his response at that first debate,\n                  Lincoln denied having assisted in drafting the Springfield platform, not realizing\n                  that Douglas was quoting the incorrect platform.First Debate with Stephen A.

        "text": "5No response from either Peck or Judd on this subject has been located, butJoseph Medillwrote and apparently hand delivered a letter to Lincoln the morning of the Freeport debate,\n                  in which he conveyed the conclusions of a meeting held by himself, Judd, Peck,Martin P. Sweet,Stephen A. Hurlbut, and Hermann Kreisman on the evening of August 26 to strategize Lincoln’s response to Douglas at that debate.\n                  Medill was uncertain in his letter whether Judd and Peck had been able to join Lincoln\n                  as requested after they left their group meeting to travel to Springfield for a meeting\n                  of theIllinois Republican State Central Committee. Many years  later, however, Judd recollected that the two had found Lincoln in his\n                  hotel in the middle of the night before the Freeport debate and roused him to discuss\n                  debate strategy. As Judd remembered the conversation, he had urged Lincoln to tailor\n                  the language of his responses to appeal to the antislavery residents of the Freeport\n                  area, but Lincoln refused to do so. Lincoln ultimately began his opening speech at\n                  the Freeport debate by responding point by point to Douglas’ questions, then elaborated\n                  on his positions. At Freeport Lincoln also pointed out that the platform Douglas challenged\n                  him on was from the Republican meeting in Aurora in 1854 and not that held in Springfield\n                  the same year, and stated that he had failed to realize this because he had not been\n                  involved with either meeting. Following his response at Freeport to Douglas’ questions,\n                  Lincoln posed questions of his own to Douglas regarding the latter’s positions on\n                  slavery. Although accounts of preparation for the debate from later in the nineteenth\n                  century portray Lincoln as posing these questions contrary to the advice of Peck,\n                  Medill, and others, three of the four questions Lincoln asked Douglas at Freeport\n                  are similar to lines of questioning suggested in Medill’s letter.Ozias M. Hatch to Abraham Lincoln; Don E. Fehrenbacher,Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850’s(Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1962), 122-26; Michael Burlingame, ed.,An Oral History of Abraham Lincoln: John G. Nicolay’s Interviews and Essays(Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1996), 44-45; Emanuel\n                     Hertz,The Hidden Lincoln(New York: Blue Ribbon Books, 1940), 255-56;The Chicago Sunday Tribune(IL), 10 May 1895, 43:1-2; Second Debate with Stephen A.
