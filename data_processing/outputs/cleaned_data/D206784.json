        "text": "2Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, dated this note to Lincoln’s time in theU.S. House of Representatives.  An examination of the congressional records lends strong credence to his contention.\n                  On January 17, 1848, RepresentativeRobert SmithofIllinoisintroduced H.R. 87, a bill to grant the State of Illinois a right of way through\n                  public lands owned by the United States, in aid of constructing theNorthern Cross Railroad.  The House referred the bill to the Committee on Public Lands, which did not report\n                  back the bill.  On January 31, 1849, theU.S. Senatepassed a bill granting Illinois a right of way through public lands, and for other\n                  purposes.  The Senate bill came before the House on February 8, and the House referred\n                  it to the Committee on Public Lands. The Committee reported back the bill on February\n                  27 without amendment, and the House read the bill a third time.Jacob Collamermoved its passage, but received no second.   A day later, RepresentativeSamuel F. Vintonmoved to reconsider the vote ordering the third reading.  The House postponed consideration\n                  of the motion.  On March 3, the House, on the motion ofJohn Wentworth, took up Vinton’s motion and, after much debate, tabled the motion.  The bill did\n                  not receive any further consideration.Illinois HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st Sess., 257-58; Illinois HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 2nd Sess., 406, 537, 556, 669-70;  U.S. SenateJournal. 1849. 30th Cong., 2nd Sess., 170-71; Roy P.
