        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln attended the Illinois State Fair, arriving in Centralia at noon on\n                  September 16 and stopping at Centralia House. Although he did not speak, Lincoln attracted\n                  crowds on the fairgrounds. He escaped to theIllinois Central Railroadsuperintendent’s office and wrote three letters to friends and political supporters.Abraham Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate from Illinois for theU.S. Senate.  Politicians and party managers often scheduled political meetings to coincide with\n                  circuses, fairs, and other local festivities to ensure a large audience. Circus tents\n                  also provided a public place for large crowds to congregate. In the 1858 senatorial\n                  campaign, Lincoln andStephen A. Douglas, his opponent and the incumbent, spoke in several localities in conjunction with\n                  circus performances or fairs. Douglas was also in Centralia and at some point, according\n                  to one newspaper, made an “outrageous attack” on Lincoln. This action backfired on\n                  Douglas, however, because of the general dislike of bringing politics into the normally\n                  non-partisan state fair.In the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly, which elected U.S. senators at that time, and Douglas won reelection.
