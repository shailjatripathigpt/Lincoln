    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on Resolution Relative to Public Depositories, 17 January\n\n18391 There has been quite a debate in theHouseon the resolution sometime since introduced into theSenateby Mr.Gatewood, relative to the deposit of the public money collected inIllinoisin banks of other states, in preference to our own banks in which theStatehas an interest.—2This debate commence yesterday, and has been terminated this afternoon. It is impossible\n\nfor me to give you any more than a general idea of this protracted debate in which\n\na great deal of interest has been felt, both in and out of the House. —As soon as\n\nthe resolutions were read yesterday, Mr.ChurchillofKane, moved to strike out all except the second resolution; this motion was lost, ayes\n\n40, noes 45.3Mr.Pacethen moved to strike out of the first resolution the word “partiality,” and insert\n\n“policy;” on this a protracted debate arose in which Messrs.WebbofWhite,Williams,Calhoun,Baker, andHappyparticipated, when the House adjourned without coming to a decision.4 To-day the question again came up.—Mr. Calhoun said he wished it distinctly understood\n\nthat he was not opposed to our banks; he wished to foster them all he could; but he\n\nwas unwilling to see blame thrown on the Gen. Government for not giving them those\n\ndeposits, which the action of the banks, had precluded them from obtaining under the\n\nlaw ofCongress; if that law was to blame, it was not the production of his political friends, 6\n\nonly of whom voted for it in theU.S.S.; he wished to call on the banks for the correspondence between them and theSecretary of the Treasury, if then, the latter was to blame, he would go for the resolutions, although the\n\nlanguage was very strange.5 Mr. Williams said he was always willing to censure those who were blame-worthy; whether\n\nthey were friends or foes, and he thought the language of the resolution was correct,\n\neven with the gentleman’s opposition it. The Government was divided into several parts, if Congress was the cause of\n\nthe injury done to Illinois, in this particular, he was for reproving them, if the\n\nSecretary of the Treasury let him bear the blame, or if ever this injustice was done\n\nus by the Executive, he would not shrink from telling him of the partiality. The\n\npopular doctrine now among the opposers of these resolutions, is that the states should\n\nregulate the currency, but while this was their doctrine, they yet sanctioned and\n\nupheld the regulation of the matter by Congress, even when that regulation was so\n\ninjurious to our own institutions. But the Secretary of the Treasury has every thing\n\nto do in this matter, he selects 16 banks as depositories, and yet pays no attention\n\nto the banks of Illinois, which are in as good or better condition than most of those\n\nselected. Mr. Williams read from the Secretary’s Report a list of the banks, and\n\nremarked that two of them have not yet resumed specie payments and that they had yet\n\non had near $1000 000 of the old deposit not yet paid, while our banks were rejected\n\nentirely. He called on gentlemen now to think for themselves; no longer crouch down\n\nat the feet of power; enquire whether justice has been done our State, and if not,\n\nthen cry out in tones so deep that all shall hear, and grant to us our rights. Mr.SmithofWabash, said he had always been afraid of our banks, and if thegeatlemanfromAdamswill show him whether any of the selected banks are for purposes of general deposit,\n\nhe should believe with him that our banks were treated badly, and would go for the\n\nresolution. Mr. Williams read from the report of the Secretary that 4 banks, viz.\n\n1 inNew York, 2 inGeorgia, and 1 inMissouri, were general deposit banksthe others were public depositories he showed the operation of this matter and conclusively proved that special and general\n\ndeposit were nearly the same thing. Mr.Cloudmoved to amend by striking out all of the original resolution, and insert some that\n\nhe sent to the chair, which were in substance, that if our members of Congress should\n\nascertain that our banks can be made depositories, &c., they shall endeavor to have them made such, &c. &c.6Mr. Williams believed it was our duty to speak out on this subject, and not ask our\n\nmembers of Congress whether we have been injured or not, said we know our own grievances\n\nand should direct them to apply a remedy. Mr. Happy agreed with Mr. Williams in saying we should judge for ourselves, but in\n\norder to do so we must have all the facts. He read an extract from the law of Congress\n\nregulating deposits; said this was a party question; it had been made such by theSangamon Journal; he should so regard it, and vote accordingly.7 Mr. Baker contended that the question was simply, whether we would stand silently\n\nby and see the General Government bear off all the revenue of this State to deposit\n\nin and enrich other states, greatly to the injury of our own. He descanted largely on the act of 1836, and the modification of it in 1838;8showed that special deposits to the credit of the , were just the same as general deposits to his credit; of as much use to the community\n\nand the banks.—He enquired why our banks should have none of these benefits; why we\n\nshould always be made the vassals of others: he called earnestly on every gentleman\n\nhere to sustain his own Illinois, to stand up for her rights, to ask, to demand it\n\nfirmly, and submit to nothing less. He said that the man who would truckle, yield, or submit, when he knew he demanded\n\nnothing but justice, was unworthy a seat upon this floor, be the representative of\n\nFreemen. Mr.WalkerofVermillion, said on last evening he tried to speak, but could not; he was opposed to the resolution\n\nas it was, for he did not feel willing to say by his vote that the General Government\n\nwas particular, but if gentlemen, would have that word in there, they wanted to make\n\nit a party question, and he would stick to his party. He talked a great deal about\n\nthe tendency to nullification of the remarks of thegentlemanfromSangamon, (Mr. Baker,) eulogised our union, and hoped Illinois would not take sides withSouth Carolina, &c.9Mr.Englishsaid he felt called upon to say something; he did not like to be told, if he voted\n\nagainst these resolutions, he was too low to hold a seat here. He dont go for making party questions; he thinks we should have no party; yet, the Senate\n\nresolutions censure the Administration; he couldn’t vote for censuring the Government;\n\nhe hopes our banks will get the deposits; he is in favor of that, but he thinks it\n\nwont be done if we censure the Administration for not doing so before. Mr.Lincolnsaid if partiality shall be proven to exist, shall we say it does? or shall we rather\n\nuse another word, which will not express our meaning, for fear we offend ourMaster; for his part, he wanted to call things by their right names, no matter who was offended. There had been partiality; it was proven by the Secretary’s report, and he believed\n\nwe would be more thought of, if we said so, especially as it could not be denied.10 After other remarks by Mr.MurphyofPerry, Pace, Williams, Calhoun andThornton, the question was taken on Mr. Cloud’s amendment and lost, yeas 43, noes 45.—11The amendment offered by Mr. Pace, was then adopted.12Mr. Calhoun then moved to strike out the 5th resolution, which was carried, when\n\nMr. Lincoln moved to lay the resolutions on the table until the 4th of July, which\n\nmotion prevailed and the House adjourned.13",

Enacted on June 23, 1836, the Deposit\n                  Act was a compromise plan to create a national banking system in the aftermath ofAndrew Jackson’s veto of the re-charter bill for theSecond Bank of the United Statesand use of select state banks, called “pet banks” by Jackson’s critics,  for federal\n                  deposits. Section one required the secretary of the treasury to select at least one\n                  bank in each state and territory, provided certain conditions were met, including\n                  if the secretary believed the banks so selected were solvent and safe enough to be\n                  repositories of public money.TheTreasury Departmentdid not employ either the State Bank of Illinois or the Bank of Illinois as repositories\n                  of public money, and the federal government had deposited revenue from land sales\n                  in Illinois  in theState Bank of Missouri. TheSangamo Journalclaimed that the government excluded the State Bank because it paid out notes in\n                  denominations of less than five dollars and had suspended specie payments. Section\n                  five of the Deposit Act stipulated that these actions would disqualify a bank to serve\n                  as a depository, and the State Bank had taken both.Robert V.

It is impossible\n               for me to give you any more than a general idea of this protracted debate in which\n               a great deal of interest has been felt, both in and out of the House. —As soon as\n               the resolutions were read yesterday, Mr.ChurchillofKane, moved to strike out all except the second resolution; this motion was lost, ayes\n               40, noes 45.3Mr.Pacethen moved to strike out of the first resolution the word “partiality,” and insert\n               “policy;” on this a protracted debate arose in which Messrs.[Messieurs]WebbofWhite,Williams,Calhoun,Baker, andHappyparticipated, when the House adjourned without coming to a decision.4"

Government for not giving them those\n               deposits, which the action of the banks, had precluded them from obtaining under the\n               law ofCongress; if that law was to blame, it was not the production of his political friends, 6\n               only of whom voted for it in theU.S.S.; he wished to call on the banks for the correspondence between them and theSecretary of the Treasury, if then, the latter was to blame, he would go for the resolutions, although the\n               language was very strange.5"

The Government was divided into several parts, if Congress was the cause of\n               the injury done to Illinois, in this particular, he was for reproving them, if the\n               Secretary of the Treasury let him bear the blame, or if ever this injustice was done\n               us by the Executive, he would not shrink from telling him of the partiality.  The\n               popular doctrine now among the opposers of these resolutions, is that the states should\n               regulate the currency, but while this was their doctrine, they yet sanctioned and\n               upheld the regulation of the matter by Congress, even when that regulation was so\n               injurious to our own institutions.  But the Secretary of the Treasury has every thing\n               to do in this matter, he selects 16 banks as depositories, and yet pays no attention\n               to the banks of Illinois, which are in as good or better condition than most of those\n               selected.  Mr. Williams read from the Secretary’s Report a list of the banks, and\n               remarked that two of them have not yet resumed specie payments and that they had yet\n               on had near $1000 000 of the old deposit not yet paid, while our banks were rejected\n               entirely.  He called on gentlemen now to think for themselves; no longer crouch down\n               at the feet of power; enquire whether justice has been done our State, and if not,\n               then cry out in tones so deep that all shall hear, and grant to us our rights.  Mr.SmithofWabash, said he had always been afraid of our banks, and if thegeatlemanfromAdamswill show him whether any of the selected banks are for purposes of general deposit,\n               he should believe with him that our banks were treated badly, and would go for the\n               resolution.  Mr. Williams read from the report of the Secretary that 4 banks, viz.\n               1 inNew York, 2 inGeorgia, and 1 inMissouri, were general deposit banks[;]the others were public depositories[;?] he showed the operation of this matter and conclusively proved that special and general\n               deposit were nearly the same thing."
