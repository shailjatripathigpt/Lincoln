        "text": "3At the outbreak of the Black Hawk War, Lincoln volunteered for theIllinois State Militia. On April 21, 1832, Lincoln and other men from theNew Salemarea were mustered into a company in the Fourth Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers,\n                  and the members of the company elected Lincoln as their captain. Pierce served as\n                  a private in Lincoln’s company from April 21 to May 27, 1832.On September 28, 1850, theU.S. Congresspassed an act granting certain groups who had served in the United States military\n                  during theWar of 1812, any of “the Indian wars” since 1790, or theMexican Warparcels of public land. Per this act, the amount of land that veterans (or their\n                  legal heirs) were entitled to depended upon the length of their engagement and actual\n                  time served. Pierce was prompted to make this affidavit  by an additional act passed\n                  by the U.S. Congress on March 3, 1855, which declared that all those who had served\n                  in any U.S. war since 1790 were entitled to receive 160 acres of land in total. Pierce\n                  affirmed here that he had received the forty acres he was originally entitled to under\n                  the 1850 act in order to claim an additional 120 acres as authorized by the new law\n                  of 1855. The outcome of Pierce’s claim is unknown. Lincoln made a similaraffidavitregarding his own service later this same month and was successful in obtaining an\n                  additional 120 acres of bounty lands.Muster Roll of Abraham Lincoln’s Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Abraham Lincoln’s Company of Mounted Volunteers; Ellen M.
