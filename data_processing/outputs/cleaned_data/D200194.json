A., special sess., \n                  \n                  26-27.On December 10, 1839, Orlando B. Ficklin in theHouse of Representativesintroduced a resolution calling for the appointment of a joint select committee consisting\n                  of five representatives and three senators to investigate the condition of the State\n                  Bank and any charges preferred against the institution.  The committee would have\n                  power to subpoena persons and records.  The House adopted this resolution and appointed\n                  Ficklin, Happy, Murphy, Moore, andEdward D. Bakerto the committee.  The House Journal does not record Lincoln as originally on the\n                  committee.  On December  17, theSenateamended the resolution by striking out all after the word “Resolved” and inserted\n                  a substitute.  The Senate resolution gave the select committee power, among other\n                  things, to ascertain if the Bank had forfeited its charter.  After further amendment,\n                  the Senate adopted the resolution  as substituted and amended, and named Monroe, Woodworth,\n                  and Wood to the committee.  On December 21, the House concurred with the Senate amendments,\n                  and at this point Lincoln replaced Baker on the committee.Illinois HouseJournal. 1839. 11th G.
