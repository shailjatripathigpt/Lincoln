        "text": "2David A. Smith responded to Lincoln on February 21, but Smith’s letter is not extant.Smith was an appellee  and the attorney of appellee Albert G. Caldwell in a lawsuit\n                  againstMoses G. Atwoodin theIllinois Supreme Court.Atwood first brought suit against Smith, Caldwell, and others in December 1849 in\n                  the chancery division of theMadison County Circuit Court.  In February 1843, theIllinois General Assemblyenacted legislation liquidating theState Bank of Illinois.  Pursuant to the twelfth section of that act, the Madison County Circuit Court appointed\n                  Smith, Caldwell, and others as appraisers to appraise the value of the bank’s real\n                  property inMadison County, Illinois, and arrange its sale.  On October 16, 1849, the appraisers appraised blocks thirty,\n                  thirty-one, and thirty-two of Smith’s addition--twenty-eight and one quarter acres--inAlton, Illinois, at $480.25.  Atwood offered the bank $500 for the land.  The bank refused, and Atwood\n                  sued Smith, Caldwell, and the bank's other assignees in the Madison County Circuit\n                  Court, asking for injunction against the assignees to prevent their selling  of the\n                  land to other parties and to enforce conveyance of the land to him.  The circuit court\n                  dismissed Atwood's case, and he appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court.  The Supreme\n                  Court affirmed the dismissal, JusticeSamuel H. Treatin his opinion stating that the bank was obligated by statute to abide by the appraisal\n                  of court-appointed appraisers and that the bank was not bound to accept Atwood's appraisal.\n                  Treat also affirmed that the bank's assignees had made a proper appraisal and had\n                  ordered a public sale.  Atwood had an opportunity to buy the property at the sale\n                  and had no grounds for complaint against the assignees.  Other than this letter about\n                  resolution of the appeal, Lincoln corresponded no further with either Smith or Caldwell,\n                  and his  role in the appeal is not clear.  Lincoln’s name was not included as one\n                  of the attorneys in the printed ruling of the Supreme Court.Atwood v. Caldwell et al., Martha L.
