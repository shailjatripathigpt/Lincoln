In early June 1849, Lincoln\n                  sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting letters in support of his candidacy\n                  for commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Presumably, he made a similar request of Butler.Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B.
