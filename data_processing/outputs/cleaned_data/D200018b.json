When Reuben Radford’s\n                  store was ransacked by locals in January 1833, he sold his building and stock to William\n                  Greene, who immediately sold it toLincoln & Berry. Lincoln and Berry signed promissory notes to cover the purchase of their initial\n                  business as well as Radford’s building and stock. By April 1833, Lincoln and Berry’s\n                  store had failed and in 1835 Berry died, leaving Lincoln to pay the partnership’s\n                  debts.Promissory Note of William F.
