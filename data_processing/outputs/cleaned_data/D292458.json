        "text": "4While Bissell was elected the first Republican governor of Illinois in 1856, Fremont\n                  lost the race for the presidency toDemocratJames Buchananin both the state of Illinois and at the national level. In Illinois, Buchanan won\n                  44.1 percent of the total vote to Fremont’s 40.2 percent andAmerican PartycandidateMillard Fillmore’s 15.7 percent. Both Bissell and Fremont generally had a weaker showing in Morgan,\n                  Cass, and Scott counties than their statewide average. Overall, Bissell garnered 47\n                  percent of the vote in his race, but while he earned 48.8 percent of the vote in Morgan\n                  County, he only received 38.5 percent in Cass, and 42.4 percent in Scott. Fremont\n                  saw worse results in these counties. He only received 27.5 percent of the vote in\n                  Morgan County, 18.3 percent in Cass, and 11.7 percent in Scott. Fremont placed second\n                  to Buchanan in Morgan County, but in Cass and Scott counties Fillmore claimed second\n                  place and Fremont came in third.Robert P.
