        "text": "2In hisletterto Lincoln of August 7, 1858, Albert Parker had asked Lincoln’s opinion in regards\n                  to lawsuits instituted by Asahel Gridley againstLivingston Countyresidents who had purchased land from theIllinois Central Railroad Companythrough Gridley’s agency. Gridley had  filed one such  suit against Parker on August\n                  6, 1858, in Livingston County Circuit Court. In March of 1856 Parker had given Gridley two notes; one note was made out to the\n                  Illinois Central Railroad Company for $300 in exchange for the tract of land that\n                  Parker was then purchasing, and the second note was made out to Gridley for $300.\n                  Parker claimed that his understanding was that this note to Gridley was also made\n                  in consideration for the purchase of the land, as he understood Gridley to be an agent\n                  of the railroad. Gridley maintained that he had not claimed to be an agent of the\n                  railroad, but was instead acting on behalf of Parker and that the $300 note from Parker\n                  to him represented his commission for handling the transaction.In a legal context, “consideration” is a thing such as an act or a forbearance that\n                  a promisor bargains for and receives from a promisee and “want of consideration” is\n                  a lack of consideration in a contract. Without consideration, an agreement is unenforceable.\n                  Parker had queried Lincoln whether he and the other land owners being sued by Gridley\n                  could claim want of consideration.Lincoln provided legal opinion to Parker, Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition, 2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),https://lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Details.aspx?case=141560; Bryan A.

        "text": "3Lincoln had been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Lincoln had been invited to speak at theRepublicanmeeting that was proposed to be held in Tremont on August 14, 1858, but was unable\n                  to attend due to a conflict. He spoke instead at a convention of the Republicans ofTazewell Countyin Tremont on August 30.Allen C.
