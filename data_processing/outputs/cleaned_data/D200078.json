        "text": "3The “land bill” isWhigU.S. SenatorHenry Clay’s 1836 proposal to distribute to the states the proceeds from the sale of federally-owned\n                  lands. At the same time,DemocraticSenator John C. Calhoun proposed a bill to regulate deposits of public money in banks.\n                  The bill that finally passed in June 1836, “An Act to Regulate the Deposites of Public\n                  Money,” was a compromise measure generally referred to as the Deposit Act or the Distribution\n                  Act.  It created a national banking system and also made provision for the disbursement\n                  of all federal surplus revenue to the states, not just the surplus deriving from federal\n                  land sales. All money in the treasury on January 1, 1837, in excess of $5 million\n                  was to be deposited with the states in proportion to their population. States were\n                  to receive the money in four installments in January, April, July, and October 1837.\n                  Illinois received disbursements of $477,919, $142,327 of which was used to construct\n                  railroads as part of the state’sinternal improvement system, and the remainder was to be invested in the capital stock of theState Bank of Illinoisand theBank of Illinois. \n                  Due to thePanic of 1837, the federal government was unable to pay the final installment, contributing to\n                  the financial problems of the states.Robert V.
