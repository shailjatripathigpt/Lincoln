        "text": "2In the first ofseven debatesbetweenAbraham LincolnandStephen A. DouglasinOttawa, Illinois, on August 21, 1858, Lincoln argued that the founders of the nation set slavery on\n                  a road to ultimate extinction, and that theRepublicanswere following in that path. He said, “I believe if we could arrest the spread, and\n                  place it (slavery) whereWashington, andJefferson, andMadisonplaced it, it would be in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind\n                  would, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.\n                  The crisis would be past and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years,\n                  if it should live so long, in the States where it exists, yet it would be going out\n                  of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races.”Lincoln was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  In local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection.

        "text": "3Lincoln also discussedHenry Clay’s argument against slavery at theOttawa debate. Like Lincoln, Clay believed that slavery needed to be on the road to extinction.\n                  Lincoln argued, “Henry Clay, my beau ideal of a statesman, the man for whom I fought\n                  all my humble life—Henry Clay once said of a class of men who would repress all tendencies\n                  to liberty and ultimate emancipation, that they must, if they would do this, go back\n                  to the era of our Independence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous\n                  return; they must blow out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate the human\n                  soul, and eradicate there the\n                  love of liberty; and then and not till then, could they perpetuate slavery in this\n                  country?”  Lincoln and Douglas battled over which party, the Democratic or the Republican,\n                  best represented and defended Clay’s legacy.  For published reports of additional\n                  1858 campaign speeches in which Lincoln’s explanations of how the political principles\n                  of Clay were similar to the platform of the Republican Party were reported more fully,\n                  see Report of Speech at Lewistown, Illinois,Summary of Speech at Augusta, Illinois, Report of Speech at Bloomington, Illinois, and Report of Speech at Edwardsville, Illinois.First Debate with Stephen A.
