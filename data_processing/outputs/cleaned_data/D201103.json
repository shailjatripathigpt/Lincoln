It was clear, logical, argumentative, eloquent, powerful\n\nand convincing. In a most able manner did Mr. Lincoln clear up and refute the charges\n\nthat he was anAbolitionistand an Amalgamationist, and in favor of placing negroes upon a social and political\n\nquality with the whites.3He asserted positively, and proved conclusively by his former acts and speeches\n\nthat he was not in favor of interfering with slavery in the States where it exists,\n\nnor ever had been. That he was not even in favor of abolishing slavery in theDistrict of Columbia, unless a majority of the people of the District should be in favor of it, and remuneration\n\nshould be made to masters who might be unwilling to give up their slaves without compensation;\n\nand even then he would want it done gradually.4He also showed clearly, what nobody but theDemocratsdeny, that slavery is a great moral, social, and political evil, and was so looked\n\nupon by all the fathers of the Government—that the institution was considered a foul\n\nblot on the Nation, which would at some future day be removed. Mr. Lincoln said he\n\nhad always believed as the fathers did, that it would in the course of time be entirely\n\nremoved from our country, until the new policy of nationalizing it had been set on\n\nfoot.—5Since that time he had believed it would either become alike lawful in all the States,\n\nor that eventually, in God’s own good time and way, it would finally disappear. But\n\nwhether it should ever become extinct or not, he was in favor of living up to all\n\nthe guarantees of the Constitution. Whatever constitutional rights the slaveholders\n\nmight have, he was in favor of protecting them. On the other hand, he was opposed to the new doctrine that the Constitution carried\n\nslavery into all the Territories, and protects it there against the wishes of the\n\npeople. It had always, until lately, been held that slavery was a creature of positive\n\nlocal legislation, and did not legally exist anywhere, in the absence of such legislation.\n\nYet he admitted that practically it would exist where there was no legislation in\n\nregard to it; that it had been so planted where ever it has existed. That it would be taken into new Territories, and there permitted\n\nto remain, until legislation would become necessary to protect it, when such legislation\n\nwould be enacted, and it would thereby become legalized.6",

At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.

Now, I do not believe that the Almighty ever intended the negro\n                  to be the equal of the white man.” Douglas also accused Lincoln of wanting to free\n                  enslaved women so that he could marry one.Philip Babcock Grove, ed.,Webster’s Third New International Dictionary(Springfield, MA: G. & C.

I should\n                  be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia. I believe\n                  thatCongresspossesses the constitutional power to abolish it. Yet as a member of Congress, I\n                  should not with my present views, be in favor ofendeavoringto abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions.First, that the abolition should be gradual.Second, that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the District,\n                  andthird, that compensation should be made to unwilling owners.”Second Debate with Stephen A.

        "text": "6Lincoln believed that the passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actin 1854, establishing popular sovereignty as a means of deciding slave status for\n                  southwestern territories, was part of a larger conspiracy to make slavery perpetual\n                  and national. During his nomination at the 1858 Illinois Republican Convention, Lincoln\n                  delivered an address—widely known as his “House Divided” speech—in which he charged\n                  that Douglas was part of a plot or conspiracy to nationalize slavery. Lincoln argued\n                  that the plot began with Douglas’s Kansas-Nebraska bill, which PresidentFranklin Piercesupported, then was advanced by both theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in theDred Scott case—handed down byRoger B. Taney—and by PresidentJames Buchanan’s call to support the court’s decision. Lincoln warned his audience that, if Douglas\n                  were not defeated and the slave power not overthrown, another Supreme Court ruling\n                  could build upon the Dred Scott decision and proclaim that the U.S. Constitution prohibited\n                  states from excluding slavery within their own borders.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008),  1:458-61; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 206-9."
