Douglaswas running  for reelection to theU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Election.Bryant and Paddock are referencing efforts by some conservative Republicans to nominate\n                  a third candidate to unseat Owen Lovejoy from the Third Congressional District’s seat\n                  in theU.S. House of Representatives. Such Republicans were unhappy with Lovejoy’s abolitionism as well as encouraged\n                  by the recent rift that Douglas’ criticism of PresidentJames Buchanan’s support for theLecompton Constitutioncaused within the Democratic Party. Some of Lincoln’s friends—includingT. Lyle Dickey,Ward H. Lamon, andLeonard Swett—supported this scheme, hoping to capitalize on the votes of both conservative Republicans\n                  and pro-Douglas Democrats. Through correspondence, Lincoln privatelywarnedLovejoy of these efforts and argued to fellow Republicans that support for an independent\n                  candidate would only aid the Democratic Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-46, 456-58;Abraham Lincoln to Charles H.

        "text": "7If Lincoln wrote a reply to this letter, his response has not been located. Bryant\n                  wrote Lincoln at least two other letters related to the elections of 1858.Despite support for abolitionism among Republicans in the state’s northern counties—including\n                  Bureau County—Republican state committee members ultimately selected Lincoln as the\n                  party’s candidate for the U.S. Senate because they believed that a Republican with\n                  solid connections to the Whig Party and moderate views on slavery would have the broadest\n                  appeal and allow them to capture the votes of both those who had voted for John C.\n                  Fremont and those who voted forMillard Fillmorein theelection of 1856. Competition for voters drove both Lincoln and Douglas to focus their campaigns on\n                  central Illinois, which was more hotly contested than either northern or southern\n                  Illinois.In the local elections of 1858, Cook held over from 1856 in the Seventh Illinois Senate\n                  District. Voters in the Forty-Seventh House District elected Bryant over pro-Buchanan\n                  Democrat Thomas Tustin  and pro-Douglas Democrat Benjamin L. Smith, awarding Bryant\n                  2,570 votes to Tustin’s 786 and Smith’s 611. There is no evidence that an independent\n                  candidate ran in the Forty-Seventh House District. In Illinois’ Third Congressional\n                  District, Lovejoy won reelection, defeatinganti-LecomptonDemocrat George W. Armstrong as well as Buchanan Democrat David Leroy with 57.7 percent\n                  of the vote to Armstrong’s 38.8 percent and Leroy’s 3.4 percent.In the local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in\n                  Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly\n                  and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through\n                  his participation in theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.John H.
