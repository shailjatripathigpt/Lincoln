Ray pleaded, \"You may have sent me those notes which I have teased you about\n                  so frequently. If you have not, I beg you, do not delay their preparation an hour\n                  beyond the time necessary to give them completeness and an intelligible shape.\"  Lincoln,\n                  however,  did not comply with Ray, Medill, & Company's request. Raywroteanother letter that July to Lincoln, explaining, \"It was my suspicion that Abe Lincoln\n                  was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth; and that suspicion more than anything\n                  else impelled me to make the request which I did,\" later adding, \"Had you not better\n                  reconsider your refusal?\"  Lincoln apparently did not reconsider; no biography or\n                  autobiography of Abraham Lincoln appeared in theChicago Press and Tribunein 1858 or 1859."
