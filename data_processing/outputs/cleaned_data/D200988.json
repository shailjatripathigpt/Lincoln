        "text": "2Lincoln’s concern is with theNew York Tribune’s apparent praise of Stephen A Douglas for his stance against theLecompton Constitution.  During the agitation over whether to admitKansasas a free or slave state, pro-slavery Kansans held a constitutional convention inLecomptonfrom September 7 to November 8, 1857, drafting a constitution guaranteeing slaveholders\n                  already in the territory their property rights and leaving the decision whether to\n                  allow new slaves into the territory to voters in a referendum. Voters could vote for\n                  the “constitution with slavery” or the “constitution without slavery,” but were not\n                  offered the opportunity to accept or reject the constitution as a whole. On December\n                  21, 1857, Kansans voting in the referendum on the Lecompton Constitution—free state\n                  Kansans abstained from participating—cast 6,226 votes for Lecompton with slavery and\n                  569 for it without slavery amid charges of voter fraud. On January 4, 1858, however,\n                  Kansans voting in elections called by the anti-slavery legislature—pro-slavery Kansans\n                  abstained from participating—overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution. Despite\n                  opposition in Kansas and considerable backlash from Republicans and the anti-slavery\n                  faction in theDemocratic Party, PresidentJames Buchanansupported the Lecompton Constitution, urging that Kansas be admitted into the Union\n                  under the its terms.  Douglas, however, opposed it, bringing him into conflict with\n                  Buchanan. Buchanan warned Douglas that he faced political reprisals if he opposed\n                  the administration, but Douglas defied the president, arguing in a speech before theU.S. Senatethat the Lecompton Constitution did not reflect the will of the actual inhabitants\n                  of Kansas, citing the December 21, 1857 vote that allowed voters to vote for the constitution\n                  but not against it.. The Senate approved the Lecompton Constitution, but Republicans,\n                  Democratic allies of Douglas, and others, with Douglas as floor leader of the opposition,\n                  defeated it in theU.S. House of Representatives. SeeBleeding Kansas.TheNew York Tribuneexplained its political position in a brief article on December 15, 1857: “The Albany Atlasproclaims that TheTribunehas been ‘converted’ to the doctrines of theKansas-Nebraska bill!The(Washington)Starmatches this by an  assertion that Messrs. Douglas,WalkerandStantonhave been converted to the views and are now sailing in the wake  of TheTribune! The truth lies somewhere between these organs— or rather, the truth don’t lie at\n                  all— an example which we affectionately commend to their consideration. We begThe Atlasto understand, once and for all, that TheTribuneholds today the identical position with regard to Slavery in the Territories which\n                  that sameAtlas, in its days of comparative honestly, professed to maintain. We do not agree with\n                  Senator Douglas that the first ten, fifty, five hundred, or five thousand settlers\n                  in a Territory have a right to carry thither slaves and therein establish Slavery;\n                  we hold with ThomasJeffersonthat Slavery should be excluded from every Territory by its organic law. But, when\n                  Slavery has once gained a foothold in a Territory and obtained aquasilegalization there, if Mr. Douglas or Gov. Walker asserts the right of the People\n                  to vote itout, we backthatdoctrine right heartily.”New-York Tribune, 15 December 1857, 4:4; David M. Potter,The Impending Crisis: America Before the Civil War 1848-1861(New York: Harper & Row, 1976), 307, 315-16, 318, 320, 325; Wendall H.
