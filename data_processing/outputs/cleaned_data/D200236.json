    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on “A Bill Providing for the Payment of Interest upon\n\nthe Public Debt,” 12 December 18401 The bill to provide for the payment of the January interest, introduced heretofore\n\nby Mr.Hicks, coming up for consideration, Mr.TRUMBULLappealed to theHouseto pass the bill immediately, and make provision for the debts we legally owe. Mr.\n\nT. hoped those gentlemen who hadepicted so strongly the fatal results of not sustaining the credit of the State, would\n\njoin with him in support of this bill, and at all events provide for the payment of\n\nthose debts about which there was no dispute. The question as to illegal contracts\n\nmay be arranged hereafter. Mr.HENDERSONmoved an amendment to the first section of the bill, for the purpose of testing the\n\nquestionThe amendment proposed to include personal property as well as real estate in bearing\n\nthe burden of the payment. Mr. H. thought this amendment was in harmony with the provision of the constitution.\n\nThe provision of the bill was incompatible with the constitution; it taxed the land-holder\n\nexclusively, which was not taxing according to the value of property. since the money\n\nholder would altogether escape taxation. If there were no constitution the measure\n\nwould be unjust. Ought the tax to fall solely on the owners of the soil?—If so, the\n\nland owners must quit the country. Mr.WEBBexplained. He thought Mr. H. had mistaken the purport of the bill. Mr. HENDERSON if mistaken remained so still. As to the bank bonus to be set apart,\n\nthree years ago it had been set apart for internal improvement purposes, and it would\n\nbe strange legislation to set it apart for other purposes. As to safety fund bonds,\n\nthey could not be got ready by January. He only wished to test whether this house\n\nwas willing to tax the owners of land, and let all other owners of other property\n\ngo clear. Mr.CAVARLYmoved to amend the bill by striking the body out, and inserting that the Fund Commissioner\n\nbe authorized to hypothecate bonds, &c. and that he pay over the money in discharge of the interest, &c. On the suggestion of Mr.GRIDLEY, a communication from the Fund Commissioner, lying on theclerk’s table, was then readIt contained information in a letter fromNew Yorkas to the great difficulty of raising money, and stating what it was hoped theLegislaturewould do, together with some strong laudatory commendations of the Fund Commissioner,\n\nand hopes expressed that the Legislature would keep him in office by re-electing him,\n\n&c., he having made such a favorable impression on the New York community! The Commissioner\n\nhimself added some declarations of his own disinterestedness and integrity, of the\n\ndifficulty of his office and his wish to resign, &c. Mr. CAVARLY had presented this amendment, which presents the simple proposition to\n\npay the interest unembarrassed with a multitude of other questions; they could be\n\nsettled hereafter. His object was to obtain the immediate action of the house, leaving\n\nthe legal question to be settled in the proper courts. No time was now to be lost,\n\nevery moment was precious. He wished to settle one plain simple proposition, “will\n\nthe Legislature of Illinois pay the interest due on her debt?” That was the proposition\n\nnow to be decided. Mr.KITCHELLhoped the amendment would not pass; the restraint to save us from fraud was evaded.\n\nThe Fund Commissioner, under the discretion left to him to decide the legal question,\n\nwould undoubtedly pay the interest on all the bonds. Mr.DOUGHERTYsupported the amendment; the only object was to pay the interest. The Commissioner\n\nis only instructed to pay what we owe, and not what we do not owe. What use was there\n\nof inserting in the bill useless provisions, which would not settle the question as\n\nto the legal doubts raised on some of the bonds? The only effect of the repudiating\n\nclause urged by some gentlemen, would be to proclaim to the world that we had been\n\ncheated, and some of the bonds were illegally parted with; it would have no other\n\neffect than that of poisoning our credit, it would not settle the question as to what\n\nwere legal and what not. The present amendment proposes to leave the discretion to\n\nthe Commissioner to pay our debts—our just debts only—leaving it to his discretion\n\nto do what is right. Mr.DODGEhoped the amendment would pass; he would vote for almost any thing that had for its\n\nobject the payment of the interest in due time. He was not inclined to be stubborn,\n\nhe would yield his own views for the sake of saving the credit of the State of Illinois.\n\nHe deprecated the pertinacity which, after many questions had been found impracticable,\n\nstill persisted in bringing them up again. He hoped the house would unite and pass\n\nthis or some equivalent measure without any more delay. Mr. KITCHELL maintained, that having been swindled, we ought not to be afraid to proclaim\n\nit. He objected to the amendment, because it was a mere reiteration of the finance\n\nbill. Mr. WEBB made some observations in favor of the amendment. Mr.McCLERNANDwas opposed to it for several reasons: 1st. Because it was too general and loose,\n\ngiving power to the Commissioner without limitation, in relation to the bonds. 2d.\n\nBecause it made him a judge to decide a question which the house had not been able\n\nto decide. 3d. Because it was the same bill which the house had already rejected in\n\nseveral forms. Mr. McC. replied to the objections of Mr. Henderson as to land tax\n\nand tax on personal property, showing that this bill raised no tax but only went to\n\napply a tax already imposed by the revenue law. The argument, therefore, as to unequal\n\ntaxation did not apply in this case, and fell to the ground. Mr.LINCOLNhad thought at first that some permanent provision ought to have been made for the\n\nbonds to be hypothecated. He was in favor of such a permanent fund, but he was soon\n\nconvinced that if we connect with the question at this moment matters of finance,\n\nof revenue and taxation, nothing could be done. He was willing to go for the naked\n\nproposition, simply to pay the interest due. Mr. L. therefore, now proposed to adopt\n\nthis amendment, without clogging it with revenue questions. He wished to see by a\n\ndirect vote if the house would adopt the naked proposition. He for one was for it;\n\nif any details required amendment, it could be done hereafter. The question on the amendment was taken by ayes and nays, and decided in the negative—ayes\n\n41, nays 47. Mr. TRUMBULL moved that the amendment of Mr. Henderson, making all property and not\n\nlanded property alone liable, be laid upon the table; which motion was lost—aye35, nays 43. Mr.WHITEmoved the previous question; which was not assented to—ayes 38, nays 43. The question being on Mr. Henderson’s amendment, Mr. TRUMBULL moved a substitute for the whole section in lieu of the amendment, providing\n\nthat hereafter all the State’s portion of the revenue to be derived from lands hereafter\n\nbecoming taxable, be appropriated to the redemption of the bonds. Mr. Trumbull explained\n\nhis proposition, shewing that it did not interfere with the counties. Mr.MURPHY, ofPerry, objected that this amendment would make the tax fall unequally; he suggested to\n\nmodify it by making personal property subject to pay this interest as well as landed\n\nproperty. Mr. TRUMBULL explained, that this amendment appropriated a part of a tax already\n\nimposed, leaving the tax on personal property to go for State uses; it imposed no\n\nnew tax. The amendment was then agreed to. Mr. McCLERNAND proposed to fill up the blank in section 6 with the number 7, so that\n\nno bond would be sold under 7 per cent. Mr. KITCHELL moved to insert revenue in lieu of bonus. After some remarks by Mr. McCLERNAND, and reply from Mr. K., the motion waslost. Mr.PECKwished to know if it would be possible for theGovernorto prepare these bonds in time; they were to be new bonds of a new character. Mr. McCLERNAND observed, that the bonds were already in existence; he had provided\n\nfor that difficulty by retaining the old name of the bonds. The question on the engrossment was then taken, and decided in the negative—ayes 36,\n\nnays 51; so the bill was rejected.",

He was in favor of such a permanent fund, but he was soon\n               convinced that if we connect with the question at this moment matters of finance,\n               of revenue and taxation, nothing could be done.  He was willing to go for the naked\n               proposition, simply to pay the interest due.  Mr. L. therefore, now proposed to adopt\n               this amendment, without clogging it with revenue questions. He wished to see by a\n               direct vote if the house would adopt the naked proposition.  He for one was for it;\n               if any details required amendment, it could be done hereafter."
