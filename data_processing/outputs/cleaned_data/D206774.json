Lincoln had been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.The result of the 1858 race for Illinois House of Representatives in Tazewell County\n                  was thatDemocratRobert B. M. Wilsongarnered 1,955 votes, defeatingRepublicanRichard N. Cullom, who received 1,783 votes.
