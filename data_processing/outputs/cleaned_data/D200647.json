        "text": "4Tensions most likely existed between Edward D. Baker and Justin H. Butterfield due\n                  to Baker’s views about President Taylor’s handling of political patronage appointments\n                  in general, and of Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of theU.S. General Land Officein particular. In the aftermath of theWhigvictory in the1848 election, Baker had sought a position in Taylor’s cabinet. LincolnwroteTaylor  to urge Baker’s appointment, enclosing apetitionendorsing Baker signed by the Whig members of theIllinois General Assembly.   Yet Taylor did not offer Baker a cabinet position.Taylor did, however, appoint Butterfield commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office,\n                  someone whom both Baker and Lincoln had objected to as a candidate for the prominent\n                  patronage position. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Prestonprior to Taylor’s decision, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a\n                  valuable patronage position  would represent an affront to Whigs ofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Both Baker and Lincoln backed other candidates for the appointment, and Lincoln\n                  eventually lobbied for the position himself after learning that Butterfield was favored\n                  for the job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. The Taylor administration received heavy criticism for its handling of political\n                  patronage appointments, particularly after theDemocratic Partywon numerous elections in 1849, and many Illinois Whigs in addition to Baker and\n                  Lincoln were upset by Butterfield’s appointment.Abraham Lincoln to William B.
