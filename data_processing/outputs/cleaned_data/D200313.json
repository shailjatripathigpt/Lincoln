        "text": "3In 1838, the Sangamo Journal printed at least one anonymous letter from the “Lost\n                  Township,” the name of which alluded to political issues caused by the creation of\n                  new counties. In 1842, the concept was revived in a series of letters purporting to\n                  be from a woman named “Rebecca” from the Lost Townships. The first, dated August 10,\n                  1842 and published on August 19, bemoaned the failure of theState Bank of Illinoisand the subsequent depreciation of its printed paper money. On August 26, 1842, theDemocraticadministration, including State Auditor James Shields, decreed that the state would\n                  not accept its own money as payment for taxes. A widely unpopular decision, it was\n                  lambasted immediately byWhigslike Abraham Lincoln, who wrote a secondpseudonymous editorialpurportedly from “Rebecca,” dated August 27. Shields’ offense and Lincoln’s response\n                  to it nearly resulted in a duel between the two men.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 5 May 1838, 2:5; 19 August 1842, 3:1-3; Roy P.
