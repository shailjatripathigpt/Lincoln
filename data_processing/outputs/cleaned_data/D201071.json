        "text": "2At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running  as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to supplantDemocratStephen A. Douglas in theU.S. Senate. For the first part of theelection campaign of 1858, Lincoln often followed Douglas on the  trail, delivering speeches either later in\n                  the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. On July 24, however, Lincoln\n                  challenged Douglas to a series of formal debates. The Illinois press published much\n                  of the correspondence between Douglas and Lincoln on the subject. The letter Lincoln\n                  references above is mostly likely Douglas’ July 24replyto him, in which Douglas stated that he and the Democratic State Committee had already\n                  made speaking arrangements for Douglas through October and that the arrangements scheduled\n                  “will occupy the whole time of the day and evening and leave no opportunity for other\n                  speeches.” See1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Douglas indeed delivered a campaign address in Hillsboro, Illinois, on August 2.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 483-85;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.

        "text": "3TheDaily Illinois State Journalpublished a list of Lincoln’s speaking appointments for August and September in its\n                  August 6 issue.Lincoln and Douglas eventually agreed to a debate schedule, and these debates became\n                  theLincoln-Douglas Debates.Lincoln and Eccles corresponded at least once more during the election of 1858. Lincoln\n                  traveled to Hillsboro on September 8, stayed at Eccles’ home, and delivered a campaign\n                  speech on September 9.At the time, members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; hence, the\n                  outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewould decide the senatorial contest. In the local elections of 1858, Republicans\n                  won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control\n                  of the General Assembly. Lincoln received forty-six votes in the General Assembly,\n                  but Douglas received fifty-one votes and retained the Senate seat. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 6 August 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:484, 556-57;Joseph T.
