Lincoln apparently answered Hampton’s letter, but\n                  his response has not been located.Hampton most likely hoped that President Zachary Taylor would name him envoy extraordinary\n                  and minister plenipotentiary to Brazil.  There is no documentary evidence that Lincoln\n                  wrote to President Taylor and Secretary of State John M. Clayton endorsing Hampton’s\n                  application, nor any letter to Edward D. Baker requesting a letter to President Taylor\n                  on Hampton’s behalf.  Hampton did not get the appointment;David Tod, appointed by PresidentJames K. Polkin 1847, retained the job until 1851, whenRobert C.
