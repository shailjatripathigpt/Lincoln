        "text": "1The date of this fragment and Lincoln’s reply remains a mystery.   Roy P. Basler,\n                  editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, claims that the fragment was a circular Blair & Rives distributed to members ofCongressconcerning the intentions of theCongressional Globein reporting debates in Congress.  He infers that Blair & Rives distributed this\n                  circular in December 1847 or January 1848, and Lincoln replied soon thereafter, without\n                  attribution.  Efforts to locate a full copy of the circular have been unsuccessful.\n                  Blair & Rives received the contract to publish the debates in December 1846; Lincoln\n                  does not specify to which session of theHouse of Representativeshe is referring in his reply.  The editors have retained Basler’s inferred date,\n                  but it is possible that the circular could have been distributed any time from December\n                  1846 to March 1849, and Lincoln’s reply could have been written  any time from December\n                  1847 to March 1849.Roy P. Basler, ed.,The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1:422;Cong. Globe, 29th Cong., 2nd Sess.,   12,  (1846)."
