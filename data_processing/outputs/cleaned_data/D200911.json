Wells had invited him to speak at a mass meeting in\n                  Kalamazoo in support of theRepublican Party’s presidential candidate,John C. Fremont. During the1856 Federal Electioncampaign, Lincoln delivered more than fifty speeches throughoutIllinoisas he canvassed on behalf of Republican candidates.
