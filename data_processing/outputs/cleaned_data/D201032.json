At the White CountyRepublicanconvention on May 28, 1858, Ferree was chosen as a member of a central committee\n                  for the county. He also selected to represent White County at  the1858 Illinois Republican  State Convention.At the Illinois Republican State Convention, Ferree was among ten delegates nominated\n                  for the office of state superintendent of public instruction.   He received three\n                  votes on the first ballot, and his name was dropped from succeeding ballots.Newton Batemanwon the nomination on the third ballot.George W.

        "text": "4Abraham Lincoln was interested in the intentions of Senator Samuel H. Martin, a Democrat\n                  who represented White County in theIllinois Senate, and Edwin B. Webb because he was looking for supporters to assist him in his candidacy\n                  for theU.S. SenateagainstStephen A. Douglas.  Delegates to the Illinois Republican State Convention unanimously nominated Lincoln\n                  to challenge Douglas, the incumbent.   At the time, state legislatures chose members\n                  of the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for the Illinois House of Representatives\n                  and Illinois Senate were important for Lincoln's candidacy.  A split in the Democratic\n                  Party, which occurred in December 1857 after Douglas spoke out against theLecompton Constitutionand criticized PresidentJames Buchananfor supporting it, improved Lincoln's chances to unseat Douglas.David L. PhillipswroteLincoln on July 24, 1858, \"Martin . . . swears that he will do anything to defeat\n                  Douglas.\"Daniel G. HaywroteLincoln three days later, stating Webb, \"wasAnti Lecomptonat first but it is thought that he is now in favor of theAdministration.\" Hay believed that Webb would be a Democratic  candidate from the Ninth District\n                  for the Illinois House; however, Webb, who suffered from ill health,  died in October\n                  before the election.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:455, 457-85; Allen C.
