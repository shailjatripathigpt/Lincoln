        "text": "2Since the formation of the Know Nothing or American Party in Illinois in 1855, the\n                  Illinois Republican Party had to contend with their influence in local politics. After\n                  the Whig Party collapsed, some Whigs allied themselves with the American Party, but\n                  many were unaligned with either the Republicans or Democrats by 1858. The Democratic\n                  Party held an advantage in southern Illinois: not only was the region a Democratic\n                  stronghold; it was also an area settled by many emigrants from the Deep South. American\n                  Party members and old conservative Whigs in southern Illinois—particularly those with\n                  racist ideologies and deep-seated loyalties to the American South—were susceptible\n                  to Democratic appeals during the1858 election campaign.At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running as the Illinois Republican Party’s\n                  candidate to replace incumbent Democrat Stephen A. Douglas in theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, both he and Douglas crisscrossed Illinois delivering\n                  speeches and campaigning on behalf of candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. Members of the General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in the U.S.\n                  Senate at the time; therefore the outcome of the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of great importance to Lincoln and Douglas’ senatorial campaigns. Edwards and\n                  Wabash counties were part of Illinois’ Twentieth Senate district. White County was\n                  part of the state’s Twenty-Third Senate district. Wabash and White counties also comprised\n                  Illinois’ Ninth House district, while Edwards and Wayne counties comprised the state’s\n                  Tenth House district.

        "text": "3If Lincoln replied to this letter his response has not been located.While Wabash and Edwards counties contained enough undecided former Whigs to be considered\n                  part of the state’s competitive “Whig belt,” White County was not. Most of the Whig\n                  belt was located in central Illinois, which is where Lincoln and Douglas both focused\n                  their campaigns. Although neither man delivered political speeches in Wabash, Edwards,\n                  or White counties, both men spoke in other parts of southern Illinois in September.\n                  They debated one another inJonesboroon September 15, as part of the famousLincoln-Douglas Debates. Douglas also spoke inWaterlooon September 11,Chesteron September 13,Cairoon September 14,Bentonon September 16, andCentraliaon September 17. Lincoln spoke in Centralia on September 16.In the local elections of 1858, Democrats Silas L. Bryan and Samuel H. Martin held\n                  over in the Twentieth and Twenty-Third Senate districts respectively. Voters in the\n                  Ninth Illinois House district elected Democrat John G. Powell, and voters in the Tenth\n                  Illinois House district elected Democrat Robert T. Forth. In the end, Republicans\n                  won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control\n                  of the Illinois General Assembly, and Douglas ultimately won reelection. Bryan, Martin,\n                  Powell, and Forth each cast their ballots for Douglas. Through the campaign, however,\n                  and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln\n                  gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.The Illinois State Journal(Springfield, IL), 17 November, 1858, 2:4; John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968, 222; Illinois HouseJournal. 1859. 21st G.
