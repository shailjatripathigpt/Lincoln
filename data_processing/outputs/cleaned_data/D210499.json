Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere among the early contestants. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.On June 3, LincolnwroteHerrick asking him, if he preferred Lincoln to Butterfield, to write him to that\n                  effect.  Lincoln made the same request of other presumed supporters in early June.\n                  Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job\n                  went to Butterfield instead.
