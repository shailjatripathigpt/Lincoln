    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to Mary S. Owens, 16 August 18371 You will, no doubt, think it rather strange, that I should write you a letter on the\n\nsame day on which we parted; and I can only account for it by supposing, that seeing\n\nyou lately makes me thinkyouof you more than usual, while at our late meeting we had but few expressions of thoughts.\n\nYou must know that I can not see you, or think of you, with entire indifference; and\n\nyet it may be, that you, are mistaken in regard to what my real feelings towards you\n\nare. If I knew you were not, I should not trouble you with this letter. Perhaps any\n\nother man would know enough without further information; but I consider itmypeculiar right to plead ignorance, and your bounden duty to allow the plea. I want\n\nin all cases to do right; and most particularly so, in all cases with women. I want,\n\nat this particular time, more than any thing else, to do right with you, and if Iknewit would be doing right, as I rather suspect it would, to let you alone, I would\n\ndo it. And for the purpose of making the matter as plain as possible, I now say, that\n\nyou can now drop the subject, dismiss your thoughts (if you ever had any) from me\n\nforever, and leave this letter unanswered, without calling forth one accusing murmer from me. And I will even go further, and say,<Page 2>that if it will add any thing to your comfort, or peace of mind, to do so, it is\n\nmy sincere wish that you should. Do not understand by this, that I wish to cut your\n\nacquaintance. I mean no such thing. What I do wish is, that our further acquaintance\n\nshall depend upon yourself. If such further acquaintance would contribute nothing\n\nto your happiness, I am sure it would not to mine. If you feel yourself in any degree\n\nbound to me, I am now willing to release you, provided you wish it; while, on the\n\nother hand, I am willing, and even anxious to bind you faster, if I can be convinced that it will, in any considerable\n\ndegree, add to your happiness. This, indeed, is the whole question with me. Nothing\n\nwould make me more miserable than to believe you miserable— nothing more happy, than\n\nto know you were so. In what I have now said, I think I can not be misunderstood; and to make myself understood,\n\nis the only object of this letter. If it suits you best to not answer this—farewell—a long life and a merry one attend\n\nyou. But if you conclude to write back, speak as plainly as I do. There can be neither\n\nharm nor danger, in saying, to me, any thing you think, just in the manner you think\n\nit. My respects to yoursister.2",
