The Council did not\n                  have time to act on the bill before the session ended in March 4, so it did not appear\n                  in the laws for first session of the Eleventh General Assembly.    Lincoln queriedAlexander P. Field, the secretary of state, about the disposition of the bill in aletteron May 11.
