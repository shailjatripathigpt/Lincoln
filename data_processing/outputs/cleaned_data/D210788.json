Craddock was running for a seat in theIllinois House  of Representativesrepresenting the Twenty-Fifth Illinois House District, which included Cole and  Moultrie\n                  counties.Lincoln kept abreast of the races for the Illinois House andIllinois Senatein 1858 because he was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace Democratic incumbentStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senate. At the time, members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore,\n                  both Lincoln and Douglas paid close attention to the outcome of the state’s local\n                  elections.

        "text": "3Both the Illinois Republican and Democratic parties courted the votes of formerWhigsin the local elections of 1858—particularly those who had moved into the American\n                  Party following the dissolution of the Whig Party. As Chapman implies in this letter,\n                  Douglas’ strategies related to the American Party changed over time. During theelection of 1854, he and other Illinois Democrats criticized the American Party’s nativism as part\n                  of a deliberate strategy to reinforce Democratic support amongCatholicsand foreign-born voters. In theelection of 1856, concerned that members of the American Party would ally with the Republicans, Douglas\n                  promoted the idea that the Republicans were a party of radicalabolitionists. This strategy worked particularly well in the presidential contest in central and\n                  southern Illinois, where many American Party voters cast their ballots for third-party\n                  candidateMillard Fillmore, leading to a Democratic victory. Douglas carried this strategy into theelection of 1858. In his July 9, 1858 speech opening his senatorial reelection campaign, he was complementary\n                  to the American Party and, throughout 1858, he continued characterizing the Republicans\n                  as a party of radical Northern abolitionists and portrayed the Democrats as a party\n                  devoted to the preservation of the Union. Because both former Whigs and American Party\n                  members were numerous in central and southern Illinois, Douglas repeatedly invoked\n                  the name of Whig leaderHenry Clayin his arguments regarding sectionalism, slavery, and his purported desire for national\n                  unity in an effort to sway American Party voters.Allen C.

Robinson over his Republican rival, Richard J. Oglesby.\n                  Aaron Shaw, a Democrat serving in theU.S. House of Representativesat the time, never became a candidate for this seat. Voters in the Eighteenth Illinois\n                  Senate District elected Republican Marshall. Despite Republican efforts to demonstrate\n                  to voters that Douglas’ treatment of the American Party changed over time in line\n                  with his political goals, Douglas and the Democrats ultimately proved more adept than\n                  the Republicans in attracting the votes of former members of the American Party. Of\n                  the fourteen counties where the American vote had an impact on the election for state\n                  representatives, Democrats carried eleven of the fourteen counties. One exception\n                  was Illinois House District Twenty-Five. In 1856, the Democrats won this seat, but\n                  in 1858, voters elected Republican Craddock to represent them.Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the Illinois General Assembly. Lincoln ultimately received forty-six\n                  votes in the General Assembly. Craddock and Marshall both cast their ballots for Lincoln.\n                  Douglas received fifty-one votes and retained the Senate seat. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 6 October 1858, 2:3; 13 November 1858, 2:3;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 18 September 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-18; Fourth Debate with Stephen A.

You know that in our District2there is between 3 & 4 hundred more American voters than there is Republican voters\n               and Craddock thinks if he had one of Douglasses Bitterest Speeches against the American or Know nothings parties that he could use\n               it to great advantage asJohn Monroehis Douglass opponent is striving verry hard to make the Americans believe that Doughlass & His parties have never been hostile to them at least not near as much so as we\n               Republicans represent them to have been.    if you can possibly send Craddock such\n               a Coppy of one of Doughlasses speeches do so by all meansIll Guarantee he will make a judicious use of it.3It affords me great pleasure to be able to say to you at this time that our prospects\n               for success in the fall Election for Representative & Senator are a<Page 2>brightening evry day & verry fast at that and we now feel certain of success almost beyond a doubt, at the meetings\n               of our secret vigilance committee last night the reports were of the most encouraging\n               character & we parted in glorious spirits.  Several of the most bitter American leaders\n               of ourCountycame out this week for Doughlass & openly avowed themselvesDemocratsfrom this time on.  You can hardly form an Idea at the storm it raised among the\n               honest voters of the partys, they cursed these fellows loud & long, denounced them as Traitors & damd Rascals in fact for evry thing that was mean & degrading & they was theys the Honest ones, the masses of the\n               party flocked over to our side was truly astonishing, they come en masse & will do battle for us manfully from this time on.  nothing has hapened  for years that has done us as much good.  these scamps would be leaders of theK Nare now thank god where they cannot do us any further harm, right where we wanted\n               them.  Col[Colonel] John Coffee4the American presidential Elector for this district during thelast ElectionHas come out on our Side & is doing all he can to advance our interest & let me tell\n               you he is a host, all in peace among us, no Rivalry or quarellings but all united determined to win or die a trying while the Democracy are in confusion\n               on all hands, quarrells, strife, Bickerings Stare them in the face of all points.  It Has been the intention\n               of the Democracy to runJim Robinsonforcongress<Page 3>in this District but thy have become so much alarmed at the enthusiasm forOglesbyamong these oponents that they are now trying to arainge it to runAron Shaw. whether they can get it so arainged I know not but hope the cannot for if Robinson is there candidate we think we stand a slight chance of beating him but if they Run Shaw they\n               will in all probability have the Dead wood on us5but let them run who they may we will give them the verry best shot we have in the Locker.6We thinkTom Marshalls Election is sure by from 3 to 5 Hundred majority at least & we also intend to Elect\n               craddock by at least as big a majority over John Monroe.7Craddock is the best stump speaker in our ranks in thewabashvalley and theLocosfear him more than any other 3 men we have in our ranks.  We Have ourpartybetter organized than we Have ever had before a long ways & you may expect to hear\n               a favorable resporte fromOld Colesthe Day of the Election.  DrWmChambersa verry prominentAmericanleader in this county has not yet taken grounds on either side we are verry anxious to secure himhe will write you soon if he has not already Done so & Tom Marshall will write you\n               & post you in regard to what he wants, if you can consistently say any thing to Him that will have a Tendency to Bring^Him^over to our side Do so by all means8we are a making the fight on slave & Free white labor & not saying much about equality\n               or any thing of that kindthe first pay much the best  in this equality espeacolly among the wavering & Doubtfull among us"
