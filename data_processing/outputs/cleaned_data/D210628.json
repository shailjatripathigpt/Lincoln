        "text": "3Norton’sletterto Abraham Lincoln of December 12, 1854, was on the subject of potential  support\n                  among members of theIllinois General Assemblyfor Lincoln’s proposed candidacy forU.S. Senate. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.The Illinois General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make\n                  their selection for the U.S. Senate. In the first round of voting Lincoln received\n                  forty-five of the ninety-nine votes cast, but as no candidate received a majority\n                  of votes, nine more rounds of balloting ensued. After the ninth vote, with his share\n                  of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his remaining supporters\n                  to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Trumbull was victorious\n                  in the tenth vote.
