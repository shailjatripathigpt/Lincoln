        "text": "2Marshall is likely responding to a letter from Abraham Lincoln similar to the one he sentJesse A. Pickrelltwo days earlier. Lincoln asked for a list of supporters of Millard Fillmore for\n                  his plan to secure a win forRepublicanJohn C. FremontinIllinoisin the1856 Federal Election.The end of theWhig Partyand the rise of theAmerican—or “Know-Nothing”—Party added a third-party element to the 1856 election.  The American\n                  Party, in its final participation in a presidential election, nominated Fillmore.\n                  Lincoln and the Republicans believed they could create an alliance with the American\n                  Party against theDemocratic PartynomineeJames Buchananover the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories, which the Democrats\n                  supported. Lincoln sent lithographed form letters to the names he was provided, informing\n                  the Fillmore supporters that every vote for their candidate in Illinois lessened Fillmore’s\n                  chance of becoming president.Lincoln and his fellow Republicans failed to convince Fillmore’s supporters to unite,\n                  allowing Democrats to label their opponents as both nativists and worshippers of African\n                  Americans. Buchanan captured Illinois with 44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent\n                  for Fremont and 15.7 for Fillmore, and Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore to become\n                  fifteenth president of the United States. Indeed, if the votes received by Fremont\n                  and Fillmore in Illinois had been combined, Buchanan’s vote would not have been sufficient\n                  to carry the state.Thomas F.
