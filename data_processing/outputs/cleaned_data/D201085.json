In his speech at Beardstown, Mr. Lincoln renewed and clinched his charge of conspiracy\n\nagainst Mr.Douglas.2He drove it home with such power that with all his flounderings, Mr. Douglas cannot\n\nescape from it. The following is an extract from his speech: I made a speech in June last,(said Mr. Lincoln,)in which I pointed out, briefly and consecutively, a series of public measures leading\n\ndirectly to the nationalization of slavery—the spreading of that inititution over all the Territories and all the States, old as well as new, North as well as\n\nSouth. I enumerated therepeal of the Missouri Compromise, which every candid man must ancknowledge conferred upon emigrants toKansasandNebraskathe right to carry slaves there and hold them in bondage, whereas, formerly they\n\nhad no such right. I alluded to the events which followed that repeal—events in\n\nwhich Judge Douglas’ name figures quite prominently. I referred to theDred Scott decision, and the extraordinary means taken to prepare the public mind for that decision—3the efforts put forth byPresident Pierceto make the people believe they had indorsed, in theelectionofJames Buchanan, the doctrine that slavery may exist in the free Territories of the Union—4the earnest exhortation put forth by President Buchanan to the people to stick to\n\nthat decision whatever it might be,(laughter,)the close fitting niche in theNebraska billwherein the right of the people to govern themselves is made “subject to the Constitution\n\nof the United States”—the extraordinary haste displayed by Mr. Douglas to give this\n\ndecision an endorsement at theCapital of Illinois.5I alluded to other occurring circumstances which I need not repeat now, and I said\n\nthat though I could not open the bosoms of men and find out their secret motives,\n\nyet, when I found the framework for a barn or a bridge, or any other structure, built\n\nby a number of carpenters—StephenandFranklinandRogerandJames—and so built that each tenon had its proper mortice, and the whole forming a symmetrical\n\npiece of workmanship, I should say that these carpenters all worked on an intelligent\n\nplan, and understood each other from the beginning. This embraced the main argument\n\nin my speech before theRepublican State conventionin June. Judge Douglas received a copy of my speech some two weeks before hs return toIllinois. He had ample time to examine and reply to it if he chose to do so. He did examine\n\nit, and he did reply to it, but he wholly overlooked the body of my argument, and\n\nsaid nothing about the “conspiracy charge,” as he terms it. He made up his speech\n\nof complaints against our tendencies to negro equality and amalgamation.6(Laughter.)Well, seeing that Douglas had had the process served on him, that he had taken notice\n\nof such service, that he had come into court and pleaded to a part of the complaint,\n\nbut had ignored the main issue, I took a default on him. I held that he had no plea\n\nto make to the general charge. So, when I was called on to reply to him twenty-four\n\nhours afterwards, I renewed the charge as explicitly as I could. My speech was reported and published on the following morning, and of course Judge Douglas\n\nsaw it.7He went fromChicagotoBloomington, and there made another and longer speech, and yet took no notice of the “conspiracy\n\ncharge.” He then went toSpringfieldand made another elaborate argument, but was not prevailed upon to know anything\n\nabout the outstanding indictment. I made another speech in Springfield—this time\n\ntaking it for granted that Judge Douglas was satisfied to take his chances in the\n\ncampaign with the imputation of the conspiracy hanging over him.8It was not until he went into a small town (Clinton) inDeWitt county, where he delivered his fourth or fifth regular speech, that he found it convenient\n\nto notice this matter at all.9At thatplace(I was standing in the crowd when he made his speech,) he bethought himself that\n\nhe was charged with something;(laughter;)and his reply was that “his self respect alone prevented his calling it a falsehood.”\n\nWell, my friends, perhaps he so far lost his self-respect in Beardstown as to actually\n\ncall it a falsehood!(Great laughter—Douglas had called it “an infamous lie.”)But now I have this reply to make: That while the Nebraska bill was pending, Judge\n\nDouglas helped tovote downa clause giving the people of the Territories the right toexcludeslavery if they chose; that neither while the bill was pending, nor at any other\n\ntime, would he give hisopinionwhether the people had the right to exclude slavery—though respectfully asked; that\n\nhe made a report, which I hold in my hand, from the Committee on Territories, in which\n\nhe said the rights of the people of the Territories in this regard are “held in abeyance,”\n\nand can not be immediately exercised,(Mr. Lincoln here read the passage referred to, from an official document in theSenate;)10that the Dred Scott decision expressly denies any such right, but declares that neitherCongressnor theTerritorial Legislaturecan keep slavery out of Kansas; and that Judge Douglasindorses that decision. All these “charges” are new; that is, I did not make them in my original speech—they\n\nare additional and cumulative testimony. I bring them forward now, and dare Judge\n\nDouglas to deny one of them. Let him do it, and I will prove it by such testimony\n\nas will confound him forever.(Loud applause.)I say to you, gentlemen, that it would be more to the purpose for Judge Douglas\n\nto say that he didnotrepeal theMissouri Compromise; that he didnotmake slavery possible where it was impossible before; that he didnotleave a niche in the Nebraska bill for the Dred Scott decision to rest in; that he\n\ndidnotvote down a clause giving the people the right to exclude slavery if they wanted\n\nto; that he didnotrefuse to give his individual opinion whether a Territorial Legislature could exclude\n\nslavery; that he didnotmake a report to the Senate in which he said that the rights of the people in this\n\nregard were “held in abeyance” and could not be immediately exercised; that he didnotmake a hasty indorsement of the Dred Scott decision over at Springfield; that he doesnotnow indorse that decision; that that decision doesnottake away from the Territorial Legislature the power to exclude slavery, and that\n\nhe didnotin the original Nebraska bill so couple the wordsStateandTerritorytogether, that what theSupreme Courthas done in forcing open all the Territories for slavery, it may yet do in forcing\n\nopen all the States—I say it would be vastly more to the point for Judge Douglas to to say he didnotdo some of these things, didnotforge some of these links of overwhelming testimony, than to go vociferating about\n\nthe country that possibly he may hint that somebody is a liar!(Deafening applause.)I repeat and renew, and shall continue to repeat and renew this “charge” until he\n\ndenies the evidence, and then I shall so fasten it upon him that it will cling to\n\nhim as long as he lives.11 It would be impossible for me to give your readers an idea of the energy and vehemence\n\nwith which Lincoln uttered these words. It was the most terrible indictment I ever\n\nheard. Its effect was electrical. The vast audience gave three tremendous cheers\n\nwhen he pronounced the concluding sentence. Springfield.",

        "text": "2Lincoln believed that the passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actin 1854, establishing popular sovereignty as a means of deciding slave status for\n                  southwestern territories, was part of a larger conspiracy to make slavery perpetual\n                  and national. At the1858 Illinois Republican Convention, Lincoln delivered an address—widely known as his “House Divided” speech—in which\n                  he charged that Douglas was part of a plot or conspiracy to nationalize slavery. Lincoln\n                  argued that the plot began with Douglas’ Kansas-Nebraska bill, which President Franklin\n                  Pierce supported, then was advanced by both the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the\n                  Dred Scott case—handed down byRoger B. Taney—and by President James Buchanan’s call to support the court’s decision. Lincoln warned\n                  his audience that, if Douglas were not defeated and the slave power not overthrown,\n                  another Supreme Court ruling could build upon the Dred Scott decision and proclaim\n                  that the U.S. Constitution prohibited states from excluding slavery within their own\n                  borders.Delegates to the 1858 Illinois Republican Convention nominated Lincoln as theRepublicancandidate from Illinois for theU.S. Senate. He ran against, and lost to, DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.

Douglas responded in his July 9, 1858, speech in Chicago that he took\n                  issue with any criticism of a Supreme Court ruling, and opined that once a Supreme\n                  Court decision was issued, “all other opinions must yield to the majesty of that authoritative\n                  adjudication.”Robert W.

        "text": "6Amalgamation involved the action of combining distinct elements, races, or associations\n                  into one uniform whole.  An amalgamationist was believed to support the merging—or\n                  amalgamation—of the black and white races through, in this context, interracial marriage\n                  or sexual activity.In his July 9 speech in Chicago, Douglas accused Lincoln in his House-Divided Speech\n                  of fomenting a sectional war to achieve “uniformity in local and domestic affairs”\n                  that, in Douglas’s opinion, “would be destructive...of personal liberty and personal\n                  freedom.” Douglas also castigated Lincoln for his opposition to the Dred Scott decision\n                  and endorsement of political equality for blacks.  “I am free to say to you, my fellow\n                  citizens, that in my opinion this Government of ours is founded on the white basis.\n                  It  was made by the white man, for the benefit of the white man, to be administered\n                  by white men... I am opposed to negro equality.” This ran in opposition to Lincoln,\n                  according to Douglas, who wanted to afford  “the negro of the privileges, immunities\n                  and rights of citizenship.” Douglas then detailed the rights that only white men should\n                  hold, including the right to vote, hold office, or serve on a jury.  Douglas also\n                  opposed Lincoln’s purported desire to intermingle the white and black races.  “I repeat,\n                  that this nation is a nation of white people, a people composed of European descendants,\n                  a people that have established this government for themselves and their posterity,\n                  and I am in favor of not only preserving the purity of their blood, but the purity\n                  of the government from all mixed races or amalgamations.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:468;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 10 July 1858, 1:4, 5; Webb Garrison and Cheryl Garrison,The Encyclopedia of Civil War Usage(Nashville, TN: Cumberland House, 2001), 9; James A.

        "text": "I made a speech in June last,(said Mr. Lincoln,)in which I pointed out, briefly and consecutively, a series of public measures leading\n                  directly to the nationalization of slavery—the spreading of that inititution over all the Territories and all the States, old as well as new, North as well as\n                  South.  I enumerated therepeal of the Missouri Compromise, which every candid man must ancknowledge conferred upon emigrants toKansasandNebraskathe right to carry slaves there and hold them in bondage, whereas, formerly they\n                  had no such right.   I alluded to the events which followed that repeal—events in\n                  which Judge Douglas’ name figures quite prominently.  I referred to theDred Scott decision, and the extraordinary means taken to prepare the public mind for that decision—3the efforts put forth byPresident Pierceto make the people believe they had indorsed, in theelectionofJames Buchanan, the doctrine that slavery may exist in the free Territories of the Union—4the earnest exhortation put forth by President Buchanan to the people to stick to\n                  that decision whatever it might be,(laughter,)the close fitting niche in theNebraska billwherein the right of the people to govern themselves is made “subject to the Constitution\n                  of the United States”—the extraordinary haste displayed by Mr. Douglas to give this\n                  decision an endorsement at theCapital of Illinois.5I alluded to other occurring circumstances which I need not repeat now, and I said\n                  that though I could not open the bosoms of men and find out their secret motives,\n                  yet, when I found the framework for a barn or a bridge, or any other structure, built\n                  by a number of carpenters—StephenandFranklinandRogerandJames—and so built that each tenon had its proper mortice, and the whole forming a symmetrical\n                  piece of workmanship, I should say that these carpenters all worked on an intelligent\n                  plan, and understood each other from the beginning.  This embraced the main argument\n                  in my speech before theRepublican State conventionin June.  Judge Douglas received a copy of my speech some two weeks before h[i]s  return toIllinois.  He had ample time to examine and reply to it if he chose to do so.  He did examine\n                  it, and he did reply to it, but he wholly overlooked the body of my argument, and\n                  said nothing about the “conspiracy charge,” as he terms it.  He made up his speech\n                  of complaints against our tendencies to negro equality and amalgamation.6(Laughter.)Well, seeing that Douglas had had the process served on him, that he had taken notice\n                  of such service, that he had come into court and pleaded to a part of the complaint,\n                  but had ignored the main issue, I took a default on him.  I held that he had no plea\n                  to make to the general charge.  So, when I was called on to reply to him twenty-four\n                  hours afterwards, I renewed the charge as explicitly as I could.  My speech was reported and published on the following morning, and of course Judge Douglas\n                  saw it.7He went fromChicagotoBloomington, and there made another and longer speech, and yet took no notice of the “conspiracy\n                  charge.”  He then went toSpringfieldand made another elaborate argument, but was not prevailed upon to know anything\n                  about the outstanding indictment.  I made another speech in Springfield—this time\n                  taking it for granted that Judge Douglas was satisfied to take his chances in the\n                  campaign with the imputation of the conspiracy hanging over him.8It was not until he went into a small town (Clinton) inDeWitt county, where he delivered his fourth or fifth regular speech, that he found it convenient\n                  to notice this matter at all.9At thatplace(I was standing in the crowd when he made his speech,) he bethought himself that\n                  he was charged with something;(laughter;)and his reply was that “his self respect  alone prevented his calling it a falsehood.”\n                  Well, my friends, perhaps he so far lost his self-respect in Beardstown as to actually\n                  call it a falsehood!(Great laughter—Douglas had called it “an infamous lie.”)But now I have this reply to make: That while the Nebraska bill was pending, Judge\n                  Douglas helped tovote downa clause giving the people of the Territories the right toexcludeslavery if they chose;   that neither while the bill was pending, nor at any other\n                  time, would he give hisopinionwhether the people had the right to exclude slavery—though respectfully asked; that\n                  he made a report, which I hold in my hand, from the Committee on Territories, in which\n                  he said the rights of the people of the Territories in this regard are “held in abeyance,”\n                  and can not be immediately exercised,(Mr. Lincoln here read the passage referred to, from an official document in theSenate;)10that the Dred Scott decision expressly denies any such right, but declares that neitherCongressnor theTerritorial Legislaturecan keep slavery out of Kansas; and that Judge Douglasindorses that decision.  All these “charges” are new; that is, I did not make them in my original speech—they\n                  are additional and cumulative testimony.  I bring them forward now, and dare Judge\n                  Douglas to deny one of them.  Let him do it, and I will prove it by such testimony\n                  as will confound him forever.(Loud applause.)I say to you, gentlemen, that it would be more to the purpose for Judge Douglas\n                  to say that he didnotrepeal theMissouri Compromise; that he didnotmake slavery possible where it was impossible before; that he didnotleave a niche in the Nebraska bill for the Dred Scott decision to rest in; that he\n                  didnotvote down a clause giving the people the right to exclude slavery if they wanted\n                  to; that he didnotrefuse to give his individual opinion whether a Territorial Legislature could exclude\n                  slavery; that he didnotmake a report to the Senate in which he said that the rights of the people in this\n                  regard were “held in abeyance” and could not be immediately exercised; that he didnotmake a hasty indorsement of the Dred Scott decision over at Springfield; that he doesnotnow indorse that decision; that that decision doesnottake away from the Territorial Legislature the power to exclude slavery, and that\n                  he didnotin the original Nebraska bill so couple the wordsStateandTerritorytogether, that what theSupreme Courthas done in forcing open all the Territories for slavery, it may yet do in forcing\n                  open all the States—I say it would be vastly more to the point for Judge Douglas to to say he didnotdo some of these things, didnotforge some of these links of overwhelming testimony, than to go vociferating about\n                  the country that possibly he may hint that somebody is a liar!(Deafening applause.)I repeat and renew, and shall continue to repeat and renew this “charge” until he\n                  denies the evidence, and then I shall so fasten it upon him that it will cling to\n                  him as long as he lives.11"
