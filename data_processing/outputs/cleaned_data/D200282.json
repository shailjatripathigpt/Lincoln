In late 1840, Thomas Lincoln had purchased this\n                  parcel for $50, as well as another contiguous 80 acres for $400.  By purchasing this\n                  parcel for $200 and giving them a life interest to it, Abraham Lincoln effectively\n                  made a cash gift to his father and stepmother. After his father’s death, Abraham Lincoln\n                  retained title to this 40-acre parcel  in order to protect  Sarah Lincoln’s right\n                  to the income from the land.Harry E.
