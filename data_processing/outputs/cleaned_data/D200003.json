        "text": "2An estray is any domestic animal found wandering, whose ownership is unknown; the\n                  term also applies to water craft found adrift.  Illinois law required the finder of\n                  an estray to register their possession with a justice of the peace. The justice of\n                  the peace would have two or three persons from the neighborhood appraise the estray,\n                  and report its description and value to the clerk of thecounty commissioners’ court.  If the value were more than $15, the clerk would advertise the estray in public\n                  places and a local newspaper.  If no owner appeared to prove his ownership within\n                  a year, the finder of the estray would deliver it to the sheriff, who would sell it\n                  at public auction and deposit the proceeds into the county treasury, after paying\n                  the finder the costs of taking care of the animal.“An Act concerning Water Crafts, Found Adrift, Lost Goods, and Estray Animals,” 31\n                     January 1827,Revised Laws of Illinois(1827), 189-98."
