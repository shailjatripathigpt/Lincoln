He did not deliver\n                  a public address anywhere in Jo Daviess County between this letter and the first week\n                  of November 1858.Jo Daviess County was in the Fifty-First Illinois House District at the time. Voters\n                  in this district elected Republicans James DeWolf and Halstead S. Townsend to the Illinois House. Voters in the Fourth Illinois Senate District elected Addams\n                  to the Illinois Senate. DeWolf, Townsend, and Addams each cast their ballots for Lincoln\n                  in the1858 Federal Election.In Illinois’s local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in the state, but because  pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly, Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate.  Through the\n                  campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas\n                  Debates, Lincoln gained recognition and respect within the national Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=9, October 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=10, November 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=11; John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968, 220, 222-23;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 November 1858, 2:4; Illinois HouseJournal. 1859. 21st G.
