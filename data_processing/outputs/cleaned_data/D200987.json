        "text": "4Lincoln is discussing the caseDavenport v. Sconce & DonCarlos. In March 1856, William H. Davenport purchased land fromLafayette H. Sconceand Don Carlos for $480. Davenport gave Sconce the $480, and Sconce gave Davenport\n                  a quit claim deed on the land as well as a $2,000 bond promising to give Davenport\n                  a warranty deed after Sconce received a patent from theU.S. General Land Office. Davenport claimed that although only Sconce’s name was on the bond, the contract\n                  was with both Sconce and Don Carlos. In March 1857, Davenport retained Lincoln andShelby M. Cullomand sued in the Vermilion County Circuit Court to have the contract voided and receive\n                  either the present value of the land or have his money refunded, plus interest. Davenport\n                  charged that Sconce and Don Carlos tried to defraud him and take his money by concealing\n                  information that proved that they had no legal title to the land.Documentation in the Danville, Illinois branch of the General Land Office office revealed\n                  thatSylvester W. Richmondhad entered the land to receive a patent long before Sconce developed an interest\n                  in the land, but that Richmond’s patent entry had been declared invalid because of\n                  a minor issue with the land warrant. The U.S. General Land Office inWashington, DCdirected the Danville land office to notify Richmond of this issue and permit him\n                  to enter a valid warrant on the land. Davenport alleged that Don Carlos—who served\n                  as the Danville land office’s clerk for a time—did not notify Richmond of the cancellation\n                  of his patent entry, but put a fraudulent note in the Danville land office books that\n                  Richmond had been notified, then colluded with Sconce to claim the land. Richmond\n                  did not learn that his patent entry was cancelled until Don Carlos procured the land\n                  to be entered in Sconce’s name. Richmond then wrote to the U.S. General Land Office,\n                  which issued him a valid patent for the land in October 1856, took possession of the\n                  land, and improved it to the point that it was worth $15.00 per acre.Drake, Moses, and, eventually,Elias S. Terryrepresented Sconce and Don Carlos in the case, which first came before the Vermilion\n                  County Circuit Court in April 1857. On November 24, 1860, JudgeDavid Davisruled for Davenport, declared the land purchase invalid, and ordered Sconce and Don\n                  Carlos to refund Davenport’s $480 and pay half the court costs related to the case.Bill of Complaint, Document ID: 4611; Attorney’s Notes, Document ID: 4606; Judge’s\n                     Docket, Document ID: 59014; Decree, Document ID: 59035; Judge’s Docket, Document ID:\n                     59037; Judgment Docket, Document ID: 59038;Davenport v.
