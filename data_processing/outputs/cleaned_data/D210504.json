Earlier in\n                  the spring of 1849, Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying for the position. Lincoln only offered himself as a candidate for the\n                  job after learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.  In May\n                  1849,Josiah M. LucasandWilliam H. Hendersonurged Lincoln to go to Washington, DC as soon as possible to attempt to secure the\n                  job.  See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Josiah M. Lucas to Abraham Lincoln;William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln."

In an article he wrote\n                  in 1849,Thomas Ewingtranscribed a letter fromLevi Davisto Butterfield in which Davis states that he hand delivered Butterfield’s letter\n                  to Lincoln the evening of June 9. No reply from Lincoln is extant.Neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment for commissioner of\n                  the U.S. General Land Office; the job went to Butterfield instead.
