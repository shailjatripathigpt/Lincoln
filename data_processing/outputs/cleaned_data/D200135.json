Unfortunately, there is no record of any settlement or information regarding\n                  the result of the contingency agreement in this case. Continency agreements were somewhat\n                  rare in the practice of law  during the first half of the nineteenth-century, but\n                  there were at least fifteen cases that Lincoln  handled during his law career in which\n                  he or his partners accepted one.Daniel W.

Therefore, this $25 promissory\n                  note   probably represented the fee Crain paid them for their legal services in his\n                  case."
