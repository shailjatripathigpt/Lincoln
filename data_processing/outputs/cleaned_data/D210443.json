Stockwell and\n                  Roberts were the original frontrunners for the job.  Lincoln recommended one of the\n                  two to the Post Office Department, but then he began receiving letters opposing both\n                  Stockwell and Roberts and supporting Ball as an alternative.  With Tremonters at odds\n                  over which candidate they preferred, Lincoln was forced to write the Post Office Department\n                  and ask that if the appointment was not already made, to suspend it until the town\n                  could unify around one candidate.  On April 21, LincolnwroteWilliam D. Briggsoffering  advice on how to handle the vexing problem.  Lincoln advised Briggs “to\n                  get up a full and fair meeting” of the Whigs and, if he thought fit,Democratsof the area to decide who would become postmaster.Lincoln himself preferred Roberts and recommended him for the position.

King secure a position with the General Land Office in Springfield.\n                  On April 7, 1849, Lincoln wrote aletterto Secretary of the Interior Ewing recommending King for the job of register.   \n                  On April 13, he wrote anotherletterreversing himself, recommending King for the job of receiver.On April 25, LincolnwrotePhilo H.

Opponents of King’s appointment charged him with being an abolitionist,\n                  drunkard, and gambler.  Lincoln urged Thompson to find out the truth about King, and,\n                  if the charges proved false, to take measures to sustain his endorsement of King.\n                  In the meantime, LincolnwroteSecretary Ewing  attempting to head off any charges against King or his other recommendations\n                  for jobs in theDepartment of the Interior.Acting on Lincoln’s request,  Thompson crafted a petition denying the allegations\n                  leveled against King and secured the signatures of prominent Whigs and Democrats in\n                  Tazewell County.
