        "text": "4Wentworth is most likely referring to a lengthy letter George Law wrote in early July\n                  1856 that was published soon thereafter in prominent newspapers such as theNew York Times. In the letter, Law discussed the state of the nation and called the administration\n                  of PresidentFranklin Piercean “extreme slave oligarchy of the South.” He asserted that the Pierce administration\n                  had used its political power to “crush out all independent action and honest representation\n                  on the part of the North” and argued that 1856 was the year for those who loved their\n                  country—in both the North and the South—to “unite cordially” upon Republican presidential\n                  candidateJohn C. Fremontand defeatDemocratJames Buchananas well asAmerican Partycandidate Millard Fillmore.On July 12, theDaily Illinois State Journalmentioned the above letter from Law, simply noting that Law endorsed Fremont for\n                  president. The same notice appeared in theIllinois State Journal’s July 16 issue.New-York Daily Times(New York, NY), 9 July 1856, 2:6-3:1-2;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 12 July 1856, 3:1;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 16 July 1856, 2:4."

Lincoln stumped in southern Illinois during the\n                  campaign of 1856, but few Republicans lived in the area and his speeches were generally\n                  not well-attended.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:425-26."

        "text": "6Wentworth wrote Lincoln at least one more letter during the election campaign of 1856.The Republican Party nominatedJohn Woodfor lieutenant governor on its 1856 ticket, alongsideWilliam H. Bissellfor governor. Wood had served in the Seventeenth and EighteenthGeneral Assemblies of Illinois.Ultimately, the state’s voters elected Bissell governor over DemocratWilliam A. Richardsonand American Party candidateBuckner S. Morris. Statewide, Bissell won nearly 47 percent of the vote to Richardson’s nearly 45 percent\n                  and Morris’ 8 percent. Out of the twenty-eight counties in the First, Second, and\n                  Third Congressional Districts which encompassed northern Illinois, voters in every\n                  county except one awarded strong majorities to Bissell. By contrast, out of the twenty-seven\n                  counties in the Eighth and Ninth Congressional Districts which encompassed southern\n                  Illinois, voters in every county except four voted for Richardson in strong majorities.In the 1856 presidential race, Buchanan emerged triumphant. In Illinois, he won 44.1\n                  percent of the total vote to Fremont’s 40.2 percent and Millard Fillmore’s 15.7 percent.\n                  Voters in southern Illinois overwhelmingly cast their ballots for Buchanan. In southern\n                  Illinois, only one awarded the majority of its votes to Fremont and four awarded a\n                  majority to Fillmore. Every other southern county awarded majorities to Buchanan.\n                  In northern Illinois, voters in every county except one cast their ballots for Fremont\n                  in strong majorities.Louis L. Emmerson, ed.,Blue Book of the State of Illinois, 1919-1920(Springfield: Illinois State Journal, 1919), 344;  Howard W.
