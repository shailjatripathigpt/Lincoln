Douglas spoke out against theLecompton Constitutionand criticized President Buchanan for supporting it, causing a rift in the Democratic\n                  Party and great political tension between Douglas and Buchanan. As a result, Buchanan\n                  purged many Douglas supporters from federal patronage appointments in Illinois. Archimedes\n                  C. Dickson's and Samuel S. Brooks’ removals were part of this purge. Buchanan appointed\n                  pro-Buchanan Democrat William L. Dougherty marshal for the Southern District of Illinois\n                  and, on June 14, appointed Leonard G. Faxon postmaster for Cairo, Illinois. Samuel\n                  S.

However, Trumbull is most likely\n                  alluding to the National (Pro-Buchanan) Illinois Democratic Conventions that had recently\n                  been held in Springfield, Illinois. Pro-Buchanan Democrats inSangamon Countyheld a convention on June 5, and pro-Buchanan loyalists held a state convention on\n                  June 9. During both conventions Democratic speakers denounced Douglas and fellowanti-LecomptonDemocrats, endorsed President Buchanan as the true voice of the national Democratic\n                  Party, and asserted that only those Democrats who were loyal to the platform drafted\n                  during the1856 Democratic National Conventionwere true Democrats.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 7 June 1858, 2:1; 8 June 1858, 2:1; 10 June 1858, 2:2-5."

        "text": "6The “free negro question” is a reference to debates regarding whether or how to integrate\n                  free African Americans into American society as well as whether or to what extent\n                  to grant them social, political, and civil rights. Per Illinois’constitution, slavery was prohibited throughout most of the state. Nevertheless, prior to the\n                  Civil War, most white Illinoisians considered free African Americans residing in the\n                  state problematic. In 1853 theIllinois General Assemblyeven passed a law criminalizing the emigration of both free and enslaved black or\n                  “mulatto” persons to Illinois, imposing criminal charges as well as heavy fines for\n                  any such persons who did not leave the state within ten days of emigrating. This law\n                  also authorized county sheriffs to sell the forced labor of the offending party if\n                  said party could not pay the fines. Trumbull’s analysis that the Democratic Party\n                  would try ensnare the Republican Party in debates about the “free negro question”\n                  was eventually proven correct. Douglas exploited Illinoisians’ prejudice and uncertainty\n                  toward free African Americans during the 1858 election campaign and theLincoln-Douglas Debates, accusing Lincoln and the Republican Party of favoring the immigration of free African\n                  Americans to Illinois as well as awarding them citizenship and civil rights.Ill.

Savery, “The Free Negro in Illinois\n                     Prior to the Civil War, 1818-1860,” MA Thesis (Eastern Illinois University, 1986),\n                     1; “An Act to Prevent the Immigration of Free Negroes Into This State,” 12 February\n                     1853,General Laws of Illinois(1853), 57-60; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:488-89."

During the convention, as Trumbull hoped, the Republican Party did not\n                  pass any resolutions on the topic of either the “free negro question” or the admission\n                  or non-admission of additional slave states. Trumbull and Lincoln exchanged at least\n                  seven more letters related to theelection of 1858.President Buchanan reappointed Samuel Hunt postmaster for Jacksonville, Illinois,\n                  but removed Austin Brooks as postmaster for Quincy, Illinois for political reasons\n                  in the summer of 1858. In the election of 1858, voters elected Austin Brooks—a pro-Douglas\n                  Democrat—to theIllinois Senateand Republican Leonard Swett to theIllinois House of Representatives. In the end, Republicans won a majority of the votes cast in the election of 1858,\n                  yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly and Douglas\n                  won reelection to theU.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in the\n                  Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within\n                  the Republican Party.Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1857(Washington, DC: A.
