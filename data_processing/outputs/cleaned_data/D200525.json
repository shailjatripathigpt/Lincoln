Crittenden, spent the fall of 1848 working to convince party faithful and neutrals of the general’s\n                  Whig bona fides.Anti-slavery and some regular Whigs condemned the nomination of Taylor, a southern\n                  slaveholder who had no previous political affiliation, as an abandonment of Whig principles.\n                  As an act of protest,Henry Clayand many others refused to endorse Taylor and participate in the campaign.For some “Conscience” Whigs, the nomination of Taylor proved the last straw, and they\n                  began making plans for an anti-slavery party.  Conscience Whigs and Van Buren Democrats\n                  came together to form theFree Soil Party.  The party held a convention inBuffaloin August and nominated Martin Van Buren for president.Michael F.
