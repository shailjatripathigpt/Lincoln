        "text": "2TheRepublican Partyheld itsfirst national conventioninPhiladelphia, Pennsylvaniaduring the third week in June. At the convention,John Allisonnominated Lincoln to be the party’s candidate for vice president of the United States.John Palmerseconded the nomination. During an informal vote, Lincoln received the second highest\n                  number of votes: 110 to William L. Dayton’s 253. In the end, after discussion and\n                  a formal vote, the convention’s delegates unanimously nominated Dayton as the Republican\n                  Party’s candidate for vice president.After Dayton won the nomination, John Van Dyke addressed the convention and complimented\n                  several of the nominees—including Lincoln. Of Lincoln, Van Dyke said, “I knew Abraham\n                  Lincoln in Congress well, and for months I sat by his side. I knew him all through,\n                  and knew him to be a first-rate man in every respect; and if it had not been the will\n                  and pleasure of the Convention to have selected William L. Dayton, I know with what\n                  perfect alacrity I would have gone for him.” Van Dyke and Lincoln had served together\n                  in the Thirtieth Congress, from 1847 to 1849.In aletterto Lincoln dated June 21, 1856,William B. Archernoted that it was he who prompted Allison to nominate Lincoln as the party’s vice\n                  presidential candidate. However,Nathaniel G. Wilcoxlater claimed that he had been the one to propose to the Illinois delegation that Lincoln should\n                  be nominated for vice president, and that he had convinced Archer to support the choice.Proceedings of the First Three Republican National Conventions of 1856, 1860 and 1864(Minneapolis, MN: Charles W.
