        "text": "2Fay’s reply, if he penned one, has not been located.  Fay represented DeKalb County\n                  in theIllinois House of Representativesfrom January to November 1849.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac, 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 216-17.In 1854, DeKalb County was part of Illinois’ Fifth Senate District and the state’s\n                  Forty-Sixth House District. In theelection of 1854, voters in the former electedAugustus Adamsto theIllinois Senateand voters in the latter electedBenjamin HackneyandWilliam Pattento the Illinois House of Representatives.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats.Although he won election to the Illinois General Assembly, on November 25, 1854 Lincoln\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate. In November and\n                  December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies—including this letter\n                  to Fay—seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. As a\n                  December 17letterfrom Adams reveals, Lincoln wrote Adams separately on December 5.Ultimately, however, Lincoln  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois\n                  General Assembly selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Adams cast seven ballots for Lincoln before switching his vote to Trumbull.\n                  Hackney voted for Lincoln twice, vacillated betweenMartin P. Sweet, Lincoln, andJ. Young Scammonfor several votes, then cast three more votes for Lincoln before switching his vote\n                  to Trumbull in the final two ballots. Patten did not cast a single ballot for Lincoln;\n                  instead, he shifted his allegiance betweenWilliam B. Ogden, Trumbull, and Sweet before settling upon Trumbull. Stung and disappointed by his\n                  loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public statements for an entire year after\n                  his defeat and reinvested his energies in his law practice.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73, 185; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.
