In 1835, he purchased the nearly seventy acres from the government, but\n                  later that year Ethan A. Brown,  commissioner of theGeneral Land Office, cancelled the conveyance on the grounds that the land was not subject to sale as\n                  other federal lands, due to the fact that it was a military reservation. Beaubien\n                  disputed the claim, but in 1840, theU.S. Circuit Court for the District of Illinoisvoided the certificate of sale to Beaubien on the grounds that the land in question\n                  was indeed a military reservation.A.
