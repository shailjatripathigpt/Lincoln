        "text": "2Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate from Illinois for theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  In local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but Pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection.

        "text": "3Taylor references theMissouri Compromiseand theCompromise of 1850.  TheKansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, supported by Douglas, overturned the Missouri Compromise, which had  excluded slavery\n                  north of the 36º 30' latitude,  and established that the question would be determined\n                  by popular sovereignty, or the right of the voters to determine whether or not  slavery\n                  would exist in these areas.  As theKansas Territoryinched toward statehood, the issue of whether or not slavery would be legal in Kansas\n                  became a polarizing debate.  Prior to 1854, popular sovereignty had the potential\n                  to block the extension of slavery in a politically benign way; Douglas's new use of\n                  the doctrine discredited it in the eyes of possible antislavery supporters. It also\n                  set off a firestorm of violence as outsiders tried to exert their influence. Slaveholders\n                  inMissouriwere particularly active in these efforts, and Missourians crossed the border into\n                  Kansas to vote in Kansas elections and commit acts of intimidation and violence.

Fehrenbacher,The Impending Crisis, 1848-1861(New York: Harper & Row, 1976), 155-76; 199-224; “An Act to Authorize the People\n                     of the Missouri Territory to Form a Constitution and State Government, and for the\n                     Admission of such State into the Union on an Equal Footing with the Original States,\n                     and to Prohibit Slavery in Certain Territories,” 6 March 1820,Statutes at Large of the United States3 (1846):548."

        "text": "5Douglas, unlike Lincoln and the Republicans, supported the decision in the Dred Scott\n                  case, which effectively barred any current or future emancipated slave from the right\n                  of United States citizenship and solidified the right of American citizens to transport\n                  their property wherever they wished—including taking an enslaved individual into a\n                  free state—without feared loss of that property. Douglas’s support for the Scott decision\n                  essentially invalidated his well established advocacy of the concept of popular sovereignty,\n                  which he argued allowed territorial and state governments to either allow or prohibit\n                  slavery as they saw fit. Lincoln’s main concern with popular sovereignty had been\n                  its power to “allow the people of a Territory to have Slavery if they want to, but\n                  does not allow them not to have it if they do not want it.” The Scott decision proved\n                  Lincoln’s assertion, to which he remarked, “as I understand the Dred Scott decision,\n                  if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from\n                  holding them.”Douglas’s “last dodge” was what came to be known as the Freeport Doctrine.  In response\n                  to Lincoln’s question, submitted at the secondLincoln-Douglas Debateat Freeport, Illinois, on August 27, 1858, whether people of a territory could, in\n                  light of the Dred Scott decision, exclude slavery from its limits prior to becoming\n                  a state, Douglas answered yes, claiming the citizens could exclude slavery by local\n                  legislation.  “Slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere,” Douglas famously retorted,\n                  “ unless it is supported by local police regulations, furnishing remedies and means\n                  of enforcing the right to hold slaves.”  Douglas’s “dodge” resolved the inconsistency\n                  between popular sovereignty and the Dred Scott decision, satisfying his Illinois supporters\n                  and assuring his reelection to the Senate, but denting his chances in the American\n                  South in thepresidential election of 1860.Carl Brent Swisher, \"Dred Scott Case,\"Dictionary of American History(New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1940), 2:167-68; First Debate with Stephen A.
