        "text": "2This loan constituted a mortgage for several lots of land Ruckel wished to purchase\n                  in Springfield. He made one payment to Lincoln in January 1854, but died on April\n                  9, 1854, before he could repay the remainder of this debt. Shortly after his death,\n                  his brother,Jacob Ruckel, and Richard H. Beach became the administrators of his estate.On July 7, 1853, Lincoln released lots nine, ten, eleven, and twelve of “Allen’s addition\n                  to Springfield” from the mortgage Daniel E. Ruckel had owed him. As the administrators\n                  of Daniel’s estate, Jacob Ruckel and Beach likely made the payment noted on the verso\n                  of this promissory note (shown in the second image) for December 1854. On September\n                  28, 1857, Lincoln noted that he had received $300 from Jacob Ruckel, the principal\n                  of the mortgage he had given to Daniel. This settled the mortgage. Lincoln noted that\n                  he would hand over the original mortgage and note, and that Beach would settle the\n                  remaining interest due to Lincoln on the loan. As also noted on the verso of this\n                  promissory note (shown in the second image), Beach indeed made two additional payments—one\n                  in 1856 and another in 1857.Also, on September 28, 1857, Jacob andLaura A. Ruckelmortgaged to Lincoln, for $500, four lots of land that Jacob had acquired from his\n                  brother’s estate. They agreed to repay this mortgage, plus ten percent interest for\n                  the year, within one year. This mortgage was extended, but eventually paid in full.Illinois, U.S., Wills and Probate Records, 1772-1999,\n                     17 April 1854, Sangamon County (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com, 2015);Release of Mortgage Taken from Daniel E.
