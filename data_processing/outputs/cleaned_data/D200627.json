        "text": "3As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both  Taylor and Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing. The administration hoped\n                  that by offering Lincoln a political appointment in theOregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional attacks upon Butterfield’s\n                  appointment. Lincoln was first offered appointment as secretary of the Oregon Territory\n                  in August 1849, then governor of the Oregon Territory in September 1849. Although\n                  he  seriously considered accepting the governorship appointment, Lincoln ultimately\n                  declined both offers, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Appointment of Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Territory of Oregon;Abraham Lincoln to John M.

        "text": "4Early in the competition for the appointment of commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office, Lincoln expressed a desire that the citizens of Illinois be consulted regarding\n                  who received the position but did not volunteer himself as a candidate. By early April\n                  1849, various Whigs were pressing him to enter the competition for the position. Lincoln\n                  responded to these solicitations by reiterating his support for Edwards, but he also\n                  consented to entering the competition if Edwards and Morrison could not agree among\n                  themselves which of them should withdraw and which should move forward as a candidate.\n                  By late April 1849, Lincoln still refused to enter the competition. In mid-May 1849,\n                  he received several letters informing him that Edwards had removed himself as a candidate\n                  for the position and that President Taylor had delayed a decision on the appointment\n                  so that Lincoln could lobby for the position. Operating under the impression that\n                  Edwards was stepping down, and concerned that Butterfield would receive the appointment,\n                  Lincoln finally entered the competition for the job. In alettertoJoseph Gillespiein which he discussed his regret that Edwards was upset with him over the matter,\n                  Lincoln gave June 2, 1849 as the date he “unconditionally” decided to become a candidate\n                  for the position.Edward D. Baker and Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Anson G. Henry and Others to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to William B. Warren and Others;Abraham Lincoln to Josiah M. Lucas;Josiah M.

        "text": "6This is a reference to complaints about Butterfield’s handling of land warrants for\n                  U.S. military veterans, who, according to U.S. policy, were entitled to land in exchange\n                  for their military service. Lincoln may have seen theNew York Tribune‘s criticism of Butterfield, whom the paper charged with not upholding the policy\n                  his predecessor,Richard M. Young, who received land warrants in payment for public lands. If a land warrant’s “regularity\n                  and authenticity” was suspect, Butterfield asserted that theU.S. Pension Officeshould be consulted and make a determination on the matter since the Pension Office\n                  was responsible for issuing the land warrants. If assignments (documents related to\n                  the private transfer of  the lands attached to a land warrant) were suspect, Butterfield\n                  insisted that this was not something that either he or the U.S. General Land Office\n                  staff could validate or certify as genuine. According to a letter Ewing wrote on the\n                  topic, which theNew York Tribunepublished, Ewing agreed with Butterfield that determinations regarding the authenticity\n                  of land assignments were a legal matter for the U.S. courts, not something Butterfield,\n                  as commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office, should personally authenticate or\n                  on which he should express his opinion.New-York Daily Tribune(NY), 10 September 1849, 3:1-2; 15 September 1849, 3:1-2."
