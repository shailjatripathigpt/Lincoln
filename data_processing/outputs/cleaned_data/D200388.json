        "text": "2At a Whig convention inPekinin May 1843, an agreement was made between Lincoln,Edward D. Baker, and John J. Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective\n                  Whig congressmen. Hardin and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed that the\n                  1846 nomination should have been his. While Hardin delayed officially announcing his\n                  candidacy, Lincoln set out to solidify his own support. In response, Hardin proposed\n                  that the convention system for the nomination be thrown out in favor of a primary\n                  election between himself and Lincoln. On January 19, Lincolnrefusedto agree to the change, and on  February 16, Hardin announced he would not seek the\n                  nomination.Lincoln and Hardin were vying to represent the Seventh Congressional District, which\n                  included the counties ofCass,Logan,Marshall,Mason,Menard,Morgan,Putnam,Sangamon,Scott,Tazewell, andWoodford.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:218, 231, 233;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 26 February 1846, 2:1-2; Howard W.
