    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on Petition of Norman H. Purple, 4 December 18401 Mr.Peck, from the select committee to which was referred the petition ofN. H. Purple, for a seat in thisHouse, in the room of Mr.Phelps, submitted the report of a majority of the committee, which was read.2The majority of the committee in their report, say—that from the poll books, Phelps\n\nhas a majority of seven—that they find fifteen illegal votes were cast for Phelps,\n\nand eight for Purple—and that two were rejected by the Judges, which should be counted\n\nfor Purple—leaving Purple a majority of two. In arriving at these facts, the committee\n\nsay they were not governed by legal rules, but such evidence was submitted as satisfied\n\nthem. The report concluded with a resolution that Mr. Purple should be admitted to\n\nhis seat.3 Mr.Hardin, from the minority of the committee, also submitted a report.4From this report it appears that eleven illegal votes were found on the poll books—6\n\nfor Purple, and 5 for Phelps—that were proven such by primary and satisfactory testimony.\n\nThe evidence in relation to each disputed vote is given at length in the report—and\n\nthe minority conclude that Phelps’ majority is not changed from what it appeared\n\nupon the poll books. The report animadverted at length, and with severity upon the\n\ntestimony which was admitted by the majority, in order to cast doubt upon the legality\n\nof several votes given for Phelps. Mr.Lincolnmoved that both reports be committed to a committee of the whole House, and that\n\nthe House now resolve itself into a committee of the whole House. Mr.Lincolnsaid he would state the course he proposed the House should pursue when in committee—that\n\nthe two gentlemen who had made the reports should agree as the votes about which there\n\nwas no dispute, and that the committee should then take up the disputed votes, and\n\ndecide upon them one by one, whether they should be received or rejected. Mr.Cavalrymade some remarks in opposition to this course. Mr.Gridleysaid he was not surprised at the course pursued by thegentlemanfromGreen, after having observed his course in the committee—all he asked was, that the House\n\nshould hear the testimony and decide upon each vote. He had no fears of the result. Mr.Drummondwould be willing to this course, if he had been upon the committee and heard all\n\nthe testimony; but as it was, he was not prepared to act upon it—we were acting under\n\ngreat responsibility—we were judges, and sworn to decide impartially, and<Page 2>he wished time to examine the testimony. He knew that retrenchment was necessary\n\nin our expenses; but he knew of no way in which our money could be better applied\n\nthan in calmly and dispassionately examining this testimony. It should be printed,\n\nthat all might read for themselves. He was opposed to deciding such questions in\n\nthe hurry and excitement of the moment. Mr.Lincolnsaid it would afford him pleasure to oblige hisfriendfromJoe Davies, (Mr. Drummond) but he thought his objections to taking up the matter now, were not\n\nwell founded. This is the very reason why we should now go into the testimony—we\n\nshould go into it like a jury without prepossessions, and be the better prepared to\n\narrive at correct conclusions from the testimony. The gentleman had deprecated party\n\nfeeling. He confessed he had this much feeling about it, honestly. Thegentlemanwho held his seat, was a political friend of his, and if, after an investigation,\n\nit is shown that he is fairly the representative, he should feel gratified. But he\n\ndid not believe that his mind would be swayed by party feeling, from deciding honestly\n\nand justly in this case. The sooner we could decide this matter, the better—there\n\nwas less party excitement now than there would be to-morrow, and less to-morrow, than\n\nthere would be the day after. Mr.Drummondreplied—we certainly should decide this matter immediately; but this was of minor\n\nimportance, compared with deciding it rightly. The reasons applying to a jury, would\n\nnot hold to us—the evidence there was oral—here it written, and required an examination.\n\nHe utterly disclaimed all party feeling upon such a question as this. He felt himself\n\nacting under the obligations of a juror, and he cared not whether the rightful member\n\nwas forHarrisonorVan Buren, in making up his decision. Mr.Doughertyremarked, that gentlemen seemed to have misapprehended the question before the House—it\n\nwas not whether we should now go into committee, but on the reference to the committee\n\nof the whole. The motion to refer it to the committee of the whole, was then put and carried. Mr.Peckmoved that the House now resolve itself into committee of the whole. Mr.Pecksaid, when the question was up the other day of investigating the election frauds,\n\nthegentlemanfromMorganhad stated that its only object was to get an electioneering speech upon the Journals.\n\nThe gentleman had effected the same object by his minority report, and he hoped he\n\nwas now satisfied. This report reminded him very much of what a poet had written: “Some books are lies from end to end, And some great lies were never penned.”5 Mr.P. was proceeding to point out some errors in the report, when he was corrected by\n\nMr. Hardin, who remarked, that he hoped the gentleman would not “tear his shirt.” Mr.Webbwas convinced of the propriety of the views of his friend from Joe Davies, (Mr. Drummond)\n\nthat the reports should be printed. If the committee had not agreed upon the testimony,\n\nhow did they expect the House to agree upon it, without deliberation? Mr.Murphy, ofPerry, was surprised at the course of thegentlemanfromWhite, (Mr. Webb) who had objected to printing 2,000 copies of theGovernor’smessage, over the additional number, because of the expense, and was now in favor of printing\n\nthese voluminous reports. He was in favor of the proposition of thegentlemanfromSangamon. (Mr. Lincoln.) We were prepared now, dispassionately, to decide this matter.6 Mr.Webbreplied—this was a very different matter from that of printing the additional copies\n\nof the Governor’smessage. This was absolutely necessary, in order that we might judge correctly. It was\n\nimportant to the country, that it might know what constituted a legal voter; and it\n\nwas important to many members in this House, who held their seats by small majorities,\n\nto know upon what light tenures they are held. He would move to reconsider the vote\n\non its committee of the whole. The motion to reconsider was put and lost. The question recurred of going now into committee of the whole. Mr.McClernedsaid he could think of no higher question than the present—it involved the interests\n\nof the whole community, and especially of that community upon whose rights we were\n\ndeciding. If the committee were not able to agree in their conclusions, how was it\n\nexpected that this House should agree at a moment’s warning? We could only arrive\n\nat conclusions by careful examination. The testimony should be printed. He thought\n\nthegentlemanfrom Sangamon most unhappy in illustrating our situation by that of a jury. The\n\nvery intention of a jury was that they could obtain a greater amount of information—that\n\nthey should have the best information in the best way—so we should act in this House.\n\nThe point was against the gentleman. Mr.Parsonssaid that he was not disposed to take up the time of the House with any remarks.\n\nThe gentleman fromGallatinand Joe Davies seemed determined on misunderstanding the proposition of thegentlemanfrom Sangamon. His proposition was not for us to decide now, upon the case, but\n\nto commence the inquiry now. These facts were of the simplest character—not near so complicated as those generally\n\nsubmitted to a jury They were simply as to whether these individuals had been in\n\nthe state six months—or were twenty-one, as the case might be. It was not necessary\n\nto determine these facts, or to think long upon the subject. Party influence has\n\nbeen alluded to. He was sent here as a party man, but this should not influence his\n\njudgment, in a case of this sort, nor would he decide upon party grounds. Messrs.Murphy, of Perry,Ormsbee,Bentley, and several others, addressed the House, when the vote was taken, and the motion\n\nto go into committee of the whole prevailed. The committee immediately rose and reported, and had leave to sit again. House adjourned.7",
