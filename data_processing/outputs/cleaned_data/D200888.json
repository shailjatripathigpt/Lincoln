Douglas. Throughout the1856 Federal Election, many Republicans—including Lincoln—worried that conservative former Whigs who had\n                  been drawn to the nascent Republican Party by their opposition to theKansas-Nebraska Actmight vote for  Buchanan if the Republican presidential candidate was too radical.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 6 June 1856, 2:1; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 192; Franklin William Scott,Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, vol. 6 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1910), 321; Jean H.
