        "text": "5Ridgely is referring to decrees made by the Tazewell County Circuit Court after Jackson\n                  C. Thompson petitioned the court in April 1853 to divide lands inChristian,Sangamon, andTazewellcounties that were owned jointly by him and his minor daughter, Annie E. Thompson.\n                  The court granted his petition, appointedWilliam D. Briggsguardian ad litem  for Annie Thompson (to represent her legal interests in the matter),\n                  and appointed commissioners to divide the lands. The commissioners assigned half the\n                  lands to Jackson Thompson and half to Annie Thompson, and, in May 1854, the court\n                  approved the commissioners’ recommendations.

        "text": "6Although it is unclear precisely when the “old Sheriff” completed the documentation\n                  in question, extant court records indicate that the documentation must have been completed\n                  in either 1853 or 1854. Since the Tazewell County Circuit Court oversaw the case,\n                  it is most likely that the Tazewell County sheriff completed the documentation in\n                  question. Voters in Tazewell County electedDavid Kyessheriff in 1852, and electedThomas C. Reevesas his successor in 1854. Lincoln is almost certainly, therefore, referring to either\n                  Kyes or Reeves.Decree, Document ID: 127978; Decree, Document ID: 127983,Lincoln conducted legal research for Springfield Gas Light Co., Martha L.
