        "text": "2Lincoln references a lawsuit involvingJames KellyandJesse D. Blackledge.  In August 1838, Kelly sold his share of a mill in Columbiana County, Ohio, to Nathan\n                  Harris, who financed the transaction with a series of promissory notes, with Blackledge\n                  as security.  Harris and Blackledge did not redeem the notes upon their maturity,\n                  and in August 1845, Kelly brought suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Columbiana\n                  County to recover the debt.  In June 1847, the court rendered a judgment against Blackledge\n                  and Harris for $632.59.  Blackledge failed to satisfy the judgment and moved toLogan County, Illinois.  Brewer, Kelly’s attorney inOhio, traced Blackledge to Logan County.  In October 1852, Kelly retainedLincoln & Herndonand sued Blackledge in theLogan County Circuit Courtto recover the debt. While the case proceeded in the Logan County Circuit Court,\n                  Blackledge died, and Kelly dismissed the case in order to file a claim against Blackledge’s\n                  estate.  Kelly continued to employ Lincoln & Herndon, and in 1854, he filed a claim\n                  againstDavid G. Evans, the executor of Blackledge's estate, in the Logan County Court.  In April 1855,\n                  the court refused the claim because Kelly had not filed the claim in time.  In September\n                  1855, Kelly appealed the judgment to the Logan County Circuit Court.  The September\n                  term of the court began on September 3, 1855.  The court ruled for Kelly and awarded\n                  him the judgment award from Ohio. The January 1856 term of the Illinois Supreme Court\n                  commenced on January 7.  Evans did not appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, and the\n                  amount of legal fees Lincoln requested is unknown.Lincoln and Brewer firstcorrespondedregarding this suit in November 1852.  In 1855, Lincoln wrote Brewer two additional\n                  letters about this case, and Brewer wrote one additional letter.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 9 January 1856, 3:1; “An Act to Reduce the Limits of the Eighth Judicial\n                     Circuit, and to Fix the Times of Holding Courts Therein,” 3 February 1853,General Laws of Illinois(1853),      64; Henry C.
