        "text": "3This is a reference to the controversy surrounding letters of recommendation missing\n                  or withheld from Lincoln’s file as a candidate for commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a file which was held by theU.S. Department of the Interior. Following a lengthy competition for the position betweenJames L. D. Morrison,Cyrus Edwards,Justin H. Butterfield, and, eventually, Lincoln, President Zachary Taylor awarded the position to Butterfield\n                  in June 1849. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.During the competition for the position, supporters of each candidate sent letters\n                  of reference and recommendation to both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. Although the U.S. Department of the Interior oversaw the U.S. General Land Office,\n                  President Taylor was ultimately responsible for appointing the commissioner of the\n                  U.S. General Land Office. LincolnwroteEwing June 22, 1849, requesting that all letters of recommendation and reference\n                  filed with the U.S. Department of the Interior pertaining to his candidacy for commissioner\n                  of the U.S. General Land Office be returned to him. Ewing complied, returning all\n                  but three of the letters from Lincoln’s file. Lincoln suspected that  the letters\n                  written byRichard W. ThompsonandElisha Embreewere purposefully omitted by someone at the Department of the Interior in order to\n                  give Butterfield an advantage over him in the competition for the job. In the end,\n                  Lincoln chose not to make his suspicions public—for the reasons he provides in this\n                  letter to Addison.Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing."

Richardsonto investigate Ewing’s role in and handling of patronage appointments as well as\n                  his management of pension payments and Department of the Interior accounts. On June\n                  8, 1850, theNew York Heraldreported that Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office was one patronage appointment that the Richardson Committee was investigating,\n                  particularly with regard to letters missing from the file on Lincoln that was shown\n                  to President Taylor prior to Taylor selecting the final appointee. However, when the\n                  committee filed its final reports on September 4-7, 1850, it made no finding regarding\n                  Butterfield’s appointment. The Whig-controlledU.S. Senatealso exonerated Ewing of all charges, although suspicions remained in some Whig circles\n                  that Ewing had indeed suppressed letters of recommendation from Lincoln’s  file.Cong.
