        "text": "3Admiralty refers to “a division of the law in the federal courts with jurisdiction\n                  over all maritime matters, including those related to navigable rivers and theGreat Lakes.” Lincoln is referring to the caseEads & Nelson v. Ohio & Mississippi RR.In the case, theOhio & Mississippi Railroadcontracted with the firm Eads & Nelson in 1852 to use a flatboat to transport sixty\n                  of the railroad’s cars fromLouisville, Kentuckyto St. Louis, Missouri. During the transport operation, waves from a passing steamship\n                  on theOhio Riversank the flatboat. Through an insurance contract, Eads & Nelson were able to salvage\n                  fifty-two of the cars from the riverbed. At the request of one of the railroad’s agents,\n                  the salvaged cars were placed upon the railroad’s own boats, taken to St. Louis, and\n                  placed on the opposite side of the Ohio River, inIllinois. The Ohio & Mississippi Railroad paid Eads & Nelson $1,000 as freight for the fifty-two\n                  cars, but the parties never agreed on compensation for salvage. In 1853, Eads & Nelson\n                  brought a libel for salvage suit against the railroad in the United States District\n                  Court for the District of Missouri. In 1855, the court ruled for Eads & Nelson and\n                  directed the railroad to pay the firm $3,027.85. Eads & Nelson subsequently realized\n                  that the federal court inMissouricould not execute the judgment because the salvaged cars were in Illinois. In 1855,\n                  Eads & Nelson filed another libel for salvage suit against the railroad in the United\n                  States District Court, Southern District of Illinois. The railroad retained Lincoln\n                  as well as George and Newton Strong.Lincoln and the Strongs argued that the federal court in Illinois did not have jurisdiction\n                  because the federal court in Missouri had already tried the case and ruled for Eads\n                  & Nelson. When this argument failed, Lincoln  and the Strongs argued that Eads & Nelson\n                  were not entitled to compensation because they had not salvaged the other eight cars.\n                  In July 1856, JudgeSamuel H. Treatof the United States District Court, Southern District of Illinois ruled that Eads\n                  & Nelson had a valid lien against the cars, awarded them $3,480.72 plus more than\n                  $500 in costs, and ordered MarshalArchimedes C. Dicksonto sell the cars to satisfy the judgment.  In January 1857, Lincoln and the Strongs\n                  appealed the ruling on behalf of the railroad.“Admiralty,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
