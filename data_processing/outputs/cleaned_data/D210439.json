Butterfield\n                  instead. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Commissioner of the General Land Office, Richard M. Young, had appointed Lucas as\n                  a temporary clerk in the Land Office in March 1849, but Lucas was worried about his\n                  tenure with rumors swirling that Young was to be replaced.  Lucas held onto his job\n                  through the spring, and he sent Lincoln a steady stream of letters informing Lincoln\n                  on the contest for commissioner and on appointments to land offices throughout Illinois.\n                  Lucas’ name does not appear in the official register of the officers and agents of\n                  the government employed as of September 30, 1849, so he must have lost his position.\n                  His name also does not appear in the official register for 1851, but he is listed\n                  in the official register for 1853 as a clerk in the U.S. General Land Office.Abraham Lincoln to George W.
