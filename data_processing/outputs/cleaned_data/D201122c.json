    "full_text": "The Last Joint Debate! DOUGLASANDLINCOLN. SENATOR DOUGLAS’ SPEECH. Long and loud bursts of applause greeted Senator Douglas when he appeared on the\n\nstand. As he was about to commence speaking, he was interrupted byDr. Hope, one of the Danite1faction. Dr. Hope.—Judge, before you commence speaking, allow me to ask you a question. Senator Douglas.—If you will not occupy too much of my time. Dr. Hope.—Only an instant. Senator Douglas.—What is your question? Dr. Hope.—Do you believe that the Territorial legislatures ought to pass laws to protect slavery\n\nin the territories? Senator Douglas.—You will get an answer in the course of my remarks. (Applause.) Ladies and Gentlemen: It is not nearly four months since thecanvassbetween Mr. Lincoln and myself commenced. On the 16th of June theRepublican Conventionassembled atSpringfieldand nominated Mr. Lincoln as their candidate for theU.S. Senate, and he, on that occasion, delivered a speech in which he laid down what he understood\n\nto be theRepublicancreed and the platform on which he proposed to stand during the contest. The principal\n\npoints in that speech of Mr. Lincoln’s were: first, that this government could not\n\nendure permanently divided into free and slave States, as our fathers made it; that\n\nthey must all become free or all become slave; all become one thing or all become\n\nthe other, otherwise the Union could not continue to exist. I give you his opinions\n\nalmost in the identical language he used. His second proposition was a crusade against\n\ntheSupreme Court of the United Statesbecause of theDred Scott decision; urging as an especial reason for his opposition to that decision that it deprived\n\nthe negroes of the rights and benefits of that clause in the Constitution of the United\n\nStates which guarantees to the citizens of each States, all the rights, privileges,\n\nand immunities of the citizens of the several States. On the 1oth of July I returned\n\nhome, and delivered a speech to the people ofChicago, in which I announced it to be my purpose to appeal to the people ofIllinoisto sustain the course I had pursued inCongress. In that speech I joined issue with Mr. Lincoln on the points which he had presented.\n\nThus there was an issue clear and distinct made up between us on these two propositions\n\nlaid down in the speech of Mr. Lincoln at Springfield, and controverted by me in my\n\nreply to him at Chicago. On the next day, the 11th of July, Mr. Lincoln replied to\n\nme at Chicago, explaining at some length, and re-affirming the positions which he\n\nhad taken in his Springfield speech. In that Chicago speech he even went further\n\nthan he had before, and uttered sentiments in regard to the negro being on an equality\n\nwith the white man. (That’s so.) He adopted in support of this position the argument\n\nwhichLovejoyandCodding, and otherAbolitionlecturers had made familiar in the northern and central portions of theState, to wit: that the Declaration of Independence having declared all men free and equal,\n\nby Divine law, also that negro equality was an inalienable right, of which they could\n\nnot be deprived. He insisted, in that speech, that the Declaration of Independence\n\nincluded the negro in the clause asserting that all men were created equal, and went\n\nso far as to say that if one man was allowed to take the position, that it did not\n\ninclude the negro, others might take the position that it did not include other men.\n\nHe said that all these distinctions between this man and that man, this race and the\n\nother race, must be discarded, and we must all stand by the Declaration of Independence,\n\ndeclaring that all men were created equal. The issue thus being made up between Mr. Lincoln and myself on three points, we went\n\nbefore the people of the State. During the following seven weeks, between the Chicago\n\nspeeches and our first meeting atOttawa, he and I addressed large assemblages of the people in many of the central counties.\n\nIn my speeches I confined myself closely to those three positions which he had taken\n\ncontroverting his proposition that this Union could not exist as our fathers made\n\nit, divided into free and slave States, controverting his proposition of a crusade\n\nagainst the Supreme Court because of the Dred Scott decision, and controverting his\n\nproposition that the Declaration of Independence included and meant the negroes as\n\nwell as the white men, when it declared all men to be created equal. (Cheers for\n\nDouglas). I supposed at that time that these propositions constituted a distinct issue\n\nbetween us, and that the opposite positions we had taken upon them we would be willing\n\nto be held to in every part of the State. I never intended to waver one hair’s breadth\n\nfrom that issue either in the north or the south, or wherever I should address the\n\npeople of Illinois. I hold that when the time arrives that I cannot proclaim my political\n\ncreed in the same terms not only in the northern but the southern part of Illinois,\n\nnot only in the northern but the southern States, and wherever the American flag waves\n\nover American soil, that then there must be something wrong in that creed. (“Good,\n\ngood,” and cheers.) So long as we live under a common constitution, so long as we\n\nlive in a confederacy of sovereign and equal States, joined together as one for certain\n\npurposes, that any political creed is radically wrong which cannot be proclaimed in\n\nevery State, and every section of that Union alike. I took up Mr. Lincoln’s three\n\npropositions in my several speeches, analyzed them, and pointed out what I believed\n\nto be the radical errors contained in them. First, in regard to his doctrine that\n\nthis government was in violation of the law of God which say, that a house divided\n\nagainst itself cannot stand, I repudiated it as a slander upon the immortal framers\n\nof our constitution. I then said, have often repeated, and now again assert, that\n\nin my opinion this government can endure forever, (good,) divided into free and slave\n\nStates as our fathers made it,—each State having the right to prohibit, abolish, or\n\nsustain slavery just as it pleases. (“Good,” “right,” and cheers.) This government\n\nwas made upon the great basis of the sovereignty of the States, the right of each\n\nState to regulate its own domestic institutions to suit itself, and that right was\n\nconferred with understanding and expectation that inasmuch as each locality had separate\n\ninterests, each locality must have different and distinct local and domestic institutions,\n\ncorresponding to its wants and interests. Our fathers knew when they made the government,\n\nthat the laws and institutions which were well adapted to the green mountains ofVermont, were unsuited to the rice plantations ofSouth Carolina. They knew then, as well as we know now, that the laws and institutions which would\n\nbe well adapted to the beautiful prairies of Illinois would not be suited to the mining\n\nregions ofCalifornia. They knew that in a Republic as broad as this, having such a variety of soil, climate\n\nand interest, there must necessarily be a corresponding variety of local laws—the\n\npolicy and institutions of each State adapted to its condition and wants. For this\n\nreason this Union was established on the right of each State to do as it pleased on\n\nthe question of slavery, and every other question; and the various States were not\n\nallowed to complain of, much less interfere, with the policy of their neighbors.\n\n(“That’s good doctrine,” “that’s the doctrine,” and cheers.) Suppose the doctrine advocated by Mr. Lincoln and the abolitionists of this day had\n\nprevailed when the Constitution was made, what would have been the result? Imagine\n\nfor a moment that Mr. Lincoln had been a member of the convention that framed the\n\nConstitution of the United States, and that when its members were about to sign that\n\nwonderful document, he had arisen in that convention as he did at Springfield this\n\nsummer, and addressing himself to the President, had said “a house divided against\n\nitself cannot stand; (laughter,) this government divided into free and slave States\n\ncannot endure, they must all be free or all be slave, they must all be one thing or\n\nall be the other, otherwise, it is a violation of the law of God, and cannot continue\n\nto exist;”—supposed Mr. Lincoln had convinced that body of sages, that that doctrine\n\nwas sound, what would have been the result? Remember that the Union was then composed\n\nof thirteen States, twelve of which were slaveholding andonefree. Do you think that the one free State would have outvoted the twelve slaveholding\n\nStates, and thus have secured the abolition of slavery?—(No, no.) On the other hand,\n\nwould not the twelve slaveholding States have outvoted the one free State, and thus\n\nhave fastened slavery, by a Constitutional provision, on every foot of the American\n\nRepublic forever? You see that if this abolition doctrine of Mr. Lincoln had prevailed\n\nwhen the government was made it would have established slavery as a permanent institution,\n\nin all the States whether they wanted it or not, and the question for us to determine\n\nis Illinois now as one of the free States is, whether or not we are willing, having\n\nbecome the majority section, to enforce a doctrine on the minority, which we would\n\nhave resisted with our heart’s blood had it been attempted on us when we were in a\n\nminority. (“We never will,” good, good, and cheers.) How has the South lost her power\n\nas the majority section in this Union, and how have the free States gained it, except\n\nunder the operation of that principle which declares the right of people of each State\n\nand each territory to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way.\n\nIt was under that principle that slavery was abolished inNew Hampshire,Rhode Island,Connecticut,New York,New Jersey, andPennsylvania; it was under that principle that one half of the slaveholding States became free;\n\nit was under that principle that the number of free States increased until from being\n\none out of twelve States, we have grown to be the majority of States of the whole\n\nUnion, with the power to control theHouse of Representativesand Senate, and the power, consequently, to elect as President by Northern votes\n\nwithout the aid of a Southern State. Having obtained this power under the operation\n\nof that great principle, are you now prepared to abandon the principle and declare\n\nthat merely because we have the power you will wage a war against the Southern States\n\nand their institutions until you force them to abolish slavery everywhere. (No, never,\n\nand great applause.) After having pressed these arguments home on Mr. Lincoln for seven weeks, publishing\n\na number of my speeches, we met at Ottawa in joint discussion, and he then began to\n\ncrawfish a little, and let himself down. (Immense applause.) I there propounded certain\n\nquestions to him. Amongst others, I asked him whether he would vote for the admission\n\nof any more slave States in the event the people wanted them. He would not answer.\n\n(Applause and laughter.) I then told him that if he did not answer the question there\n\nI would renew it atFreeport, and would then trot him down intoEgyptand again put it to him. (Cheers.) Well, at Freeport, knowing that the next joint\n\ndiscussion took place in Egypt, and being in dread of it, he did answer my question\n\nin regard to no more slave States in a mode which he hoped would be satisfactory to\n\nme, and accomplish the object he had in view. I will show you what he answer was.\n\nAfter saying that he was not pledged to the Republican doctrine of “no more slave\n\nStates,” he declared “I state to you freely, frankly, that I should be exceedingly sorry to ever be put\n\nin a position of having to pass upon that question. I should be exceedingly glad\n\nto know that there never would be another slave State admitted into this Union.” Here, permit to remark, that I do not think the people will ever force him into a\n\nposition against his will. (Great laughter and applause.) He went on to say: “But I must add in regard to this, that if slavery shall be kept out of the territory\n\nduring the territorial existence of any one given territory and then the people should,\n\nhaving a fair chance and clear field when they come to adopt a constitution, if they\n\nshould do the extraordinary thing of adopting a slave constitution, uninfluenced by\n\nthe actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own\n\nthe country, but we must admit it into the Union.” That answer Mr. Lincoln supposed would satisfy the old-lineWhigs, composed ofKentuckiansandVirginians, down in the southern part of the State. Now, what does it amount to? I desire\n\nto know whether he would vote to allowKansasto come into the Union with slavery or not, as her people desired. He would not\n\nanswer; but in a round about way said that if slavery should be kept out of a territory\n\nduring the whole of its territorial existence, and then the people, when they adopted\n\na State constitution, asked admission as a slave State, he supposed he would have\n\nto let the State come in. The case I put to him was an entirely different one. I\n\ndesired to know whether he would vote to admit a State if Congress had not prohibited\n\nslavery in it during its territorial existence, as Congress never pretended to do\n\nunderClay’scompromise measures of 1850. He would not answer, and I have not yet been able to get an answer fr m him. (Laughter, “he’ll answer this time,” “he’s afraid to answer,” etc.) I have asked him whether he would vote to admitNebraskaif her people asked to come in as a State with a constitution recognizing slavery,\n\nand he refused to answer. (“Put him through,” “give it to him,” and cheers.) I have\n\nput the question to him with reference toNew Mexico, and he has not uttered a word in answer. I have enumerated the territories, one\n\nafter another, putting the same question to him with reference to each, and he has\n\nnot said, and will not say, whether, if elected to Congress, he will vote to admit\n\nany territory now in existence with such a constitution as her people may adopt.\n\nHe invents a case which does not exist, and cannot exist under this government, and\n\nanswers it; but he will not answer the question I put to him in connection with any\n\nof the territories now in existence. (“Hurrah for Douglas,” “three cheers for Douglas.”)\n\nThe contract we entered into withTexaswhen she entered the Union obliges us to allow four States to be formed out of the\n\nold State, and admitted with or without slavery as the respective inhabitants of each\n\nmay determine. I have asked Mr. Lincoln three times in our joint discussions whether\n\nhe would vote to redeem that pledge, and he has never yet answered. He is as silent\n\nas the grave on the subject. (Laughter, “Lincoln must answer,” “he will,” &c.) He would rather answer as to a state of the case which will never arise than commit\n\nhimself by telling what he would do in a case which would come up for his action soon\n\nafter his election to Congress. (“He’ll never have to act on any question,” and laughter.)\n\nWhy can he not say whether he is willing to allow the people of each State to have\n\nslavery or not as they please, and to come into the Union when they have the requisite\n\npopulation as a slave or a free State as they decide? I have no trouble in answering\n\nthe question. I have said everywhere, and now repeat it to you, that if the people\n\nof Kansas want a slave State they have a right, under the constitution of the United\n\nStates, to form such a State, and I will let them come into the Union with slavery\n\nor without, as they determine. (“That’s right,” “good,” “hurrah for Douglas all the\n\ntime,” and cheers.) If the people of any other territory desire slavery let them have\n\nit. If they do not want it let them prohibit it. It is their business not mine.\n\n(“That’s it exactly,” “that’s so,” hurrah, &c.) It is none of our business in Illinois whetherKansasis a free State or a slave State. (“That’s the doctrine.”) It is none of your business\n\ninMissouriwhether Kansas shall adopt slavery or reject it. It is the business of her people\n\nand none of yours. The people of Kansas has as much right to decide that question\n\nfor themselves as you have in Missouri to decide it for yourselves, or we in Illinois\n\nto decide it for ourselves. (“That’s what we believe,” “We stand by that,” and cheers.) And here I may repeat what I have said in every speech I have made in Illinois, that\n\nI fought theLecompton constitutionto its death, not because of the slavery clause in it, but because it was not the\n\nact and deed of the people of Kansas. I said then in Congress, and I say now, that\n\nif the people of Kansas want a slave State, they have a right to have it. If they\n\nwanted the Lecompton constitution, they had a right to have it. I was opposed to\n\nthat constitution because I did not believe that it was the act and deed of the people,\n\nbut on the contrary, the act of a small, pitiful minority acting in the name of the\n\nmajority. When at last it was determined to send that constitution back to the people,\n\nand accordingly, in August last, the question of admission under it was submitted\n\nto a popular vote, the citizens rejected it by nearly ten to one, thus showing conclusively,\n\nthat I was right when I said that the Lecompton constitution was not the act and\n\ndeed of the people of Kansas, and did not embody their will. (Cheers.) I hold that there is no power on earth, under our system of government, which has\n\nthe right to force a constitution upon an unwilling people. (That’s so.) Suppose\n\nthere had been a majority of ten to one in favor of slavery in Kansas, and suppose\n\nthere had been an abolition President, and an abolition administration, and by some\n\nmeans the abolitionists succeeded in forcing an abolition constitution on those slaveholding\n\npeople, would the people of the South have submitted to that act for one instant.\n\n(No, no.) Well, if you of the South would not have submitted to it a day, how can\n\nyou, as fair, honorable and honest men insist on putting a slave constitution on a\n\npeople who desire a free State. (“That’s so,” and cheers.) Your safety and ours depend\n\nupon both of us acting in good faith, and living up to that great principle which\n\nasserts the right of every people to form and regulate their domestic institutions\n\nto suit themselves, subject only to the Constitution of the United States. (“That’s\n\nthe doctrine,” and immense applause.) Most of the men who denounced my course on theLecomptonquestion, objected to it not because I was not right, but because they thought it\n\nexpedient at that time, for the sake of keeping the party together, to do wrong.\n\n(Cheers.) I never knew theDemocratic partyto violate any one of its principles out of policy or expediency, that it did not\n\npay the debt with sorrow. There is no safety or success for our party unless we always\n\ndo right, and trust the consequences to God and the people. I chose not to depart\n\nfrom principle for the sake of expediency in the Lecompton question, and I never intend\n\nto do it on that or any other question. (Good.) But I am told that I would have been all right if I had only voted for theEnglishbill after Lecompton was killed. (Laughter and cheers.) You know a general pardon\n\nwas granted to all political offenders on the Lecompton question, provided they would\n\nonly vote for the English bill. I did not accept the benefits of that pardon, for\n\nthe reason that I had been right in the course I had pursued, and hence did not require\n\nany forgiveness. Let us see how the result has beon worked out. English brought in his bill referring the Lecompton Constitution back\n\nto the people, with the provision that if it was rejected Kansas should be kept out\n\nof the Union until she had the full ratio of population required for a member of\n\nCongress, thus in effect declaring that if the people of Kansas would only consent\n\nto come into the Union under the Lecompton Constitution, and have a slave State when\n\nthey did not want it, they should be admitted with a population of 35,000, but that\n\nif they were so obstinate as to insist upon having just such a constitution as a free\n\nState, then they should be kept out until they had 93,420 inhabitants. I then said,\n\nand I now repeat tO you, that whenever Kansas has people enough for a slave State she has people enough\n\nfor a free State. (“That’s the doctrine all over,” “Hurrah for Douglas.”) I was and\n\nam willing to adopt the rule that no State shall ever come into the Union until she\n\nhas the full ratio of population for a member of Congress, provided that rule is made\n\nuniform. I made that proposition in the Senate last winter, but a majority of the\n\nSenators would not agree to it; and I then said to them if you will not adopt the\n\ngeneral rule I will not consent to make an exception of Kansas. I hold that it is a violation of the fundamental principles of this government to\n\nthrow the weight of federal power into the scale, either in favor of the free or the\n\nslave States. Equality among all the States of this Union is a fundamental principle\n\nin our political system. We have no more right to throw the weight of the federal\n\ngovernment into the scale in favor of the slaveholding than the free States, and last\n\nof all should our friends in the South consent for a moment that Congress should withhold\n\nits powers either way when they know that there is a majority against them in both\n\nHouses of Congress. Fellow citizens, how have the supporters of the English bill stood up to their pledges\n\nnot to admit Kansas until she obtained a population of 93,420 in the event she rejected\n\nthe Lecompton constitution? How? The newspapers inform us that English himself, whilst\n\nconducting his canvass for re-election, and in order to secure it, pledged himself\n\nto his constituents that if returned he would disregard his own bill and vote to admit\n\nKansas into the Union with such population as she might have when she made application.\n\n(Laughter and applause.) We are informed that every Democratic candidate for Congress\n\nin all the States where elections have recently been held, was pledged against the\n\nEnglish bill, with perhaps one or two exceptions. Now, if I had only done as these\n\nAnti-Lecompton men who voted for the English bill in Congress, pledging themselves\n\nto refuse to admit Kansas if she refused to become a slave State until she had a population\n\nof 93,420, and then returned to their people, forfeited their pledge, and made a new\n\npledge to admit Kansas at any time she applied, without regard to population, I would\n\nhave had no trouble. You saw the whole power and patronage of the federal government\n\nwielded inIndiana,Ohio, andPennsylvaniato re-elect Anti-Lecompton men to Congress who voted against Lecompton, then voted\n\nfor the English bull, and then denounced the En lish bill, and pledged themselves to their people to disregard it. (Good.) My sin consists\n\nin not having given a pledge, and then in not having afterwards forfeited it. For\n\nthat reason, in this State, every postmaster, every route agent, every collector of\n\nthe ports, and every federal office holder, forfeits his head the moment he expresses\n\na preference for the Democratic candidates against Lincoln and his abolition associates.\n\n(That’s so, and cheers.) ADemocratic Administrationwhich we helped to bring to power, deems it consistent with its fidelity to principle\n\nand its regard to duty, to wield its power in this State in behalf of the Republican\n\nabolition candidates in every county and every Congressional district against the\n\nDemocratic party. All I have to say in reference to the matter is, that if that administration\n\nhave not regard enough for principle, if they are not sufficiently attached to the\n\ncreed of the Democratic party to bury forever their personal hostilities in order\n\nto succeeed in carrying out our glorious principles, I have. (Good, good, and cheers.) I have\n\nno personal difficulties with Mr.Buchananor his cabinet. He chose to make certain recommendations to Congress as he had a\n\nright to do on the Lecompton question. I could not vote in favor of them. I had\n\nas much right to judge for myself how I should vote as he had how he should recommend.\n\nHe undertook to say to me, if you do not vote as I tell you, I will take off the\n\nheads of your friends. (Laughter.) I replied to him, “you did not elect me, I represent\n\nIllinois and I am accountable to Illinois, as my constituency, and to God, but not\n\nto the President or to any other power on earth. (Good, good, and vociferous applause.) And now this warfare is made on me because I would not surrender my connections of\n\nduty, because I would not abandon my constituency, and receive the order of the executive\n\nauthorities how I should vote in the Senate of the United States. (“Never do it,”\n\n“three cheers,” &c.) I hold that an attempt to control the Senate on the part of the Executive is subversive\n\nof the principles of our constitution. (“That’s right.”) The Executive department\n\nis independent of the Senate, and the Senate is independent of the President. In\n\nmatters of legislation the President has a veto on the action of the Senate, and in\n\nappointments and treaties the Senate has a veto on the President. He has no more\n\nright to tell me how to I shall vote on his appointments that I have to tell him whether\n\nhe shall veto or approve a bill that the Senate has passed. Whenever you recognize\n\nthe right of the Executive to say to a Senator, “do this, or I will take off the heads\n\nof your friends,” you convert this government from a republic into a despotism. (Hear,\n\nhear, and cheers.) Whenever you recognize the rights of a President to say to a member\n\nof Congress, “vote as I tell, or I will bring a power to bear against you at home\n\nwhich will crush you,” you destroy the independence of the representative, and convert\n\nhim into a tool of Executive power. (“That’s so, and applause.) I resisted this invasion\n\nof the constitutional rights of a Senator, and I intend to resist it as long as I\n\nhave a voice to speak, or a vote to give. Yet, Mr. Buchanan cannot provoke me to\n\nabandon one iota of Democratic principles out of revenge or hostility to his course.\n\n(“Good, good, three cheers for Douglas.”) I stand by the platform of the Democratic\n\nparty, and by its organization, and support its nominees. If there are any who choose\n\nto bolt, the fact only shows that they are not as good Democrats as I am. (“That’s\n\nso, “good,” and applause.) My friends, there never was a time when it was as important for the Democratic party,\n\nfor all national men, to rally and stand together as it is to-day. We find all sectional men giving up past differences and continuing the one question\n\nof slavery, and when we find sectional men thus uniting, we should unite to resist\n\nthem and their treasonable designs. Such was the case in 1850, when Clay left the\n\nquiet and peace of his home, and again entered upon public life to quell agitation\n\nand restore peace to a distracted Union. Then we Democrats, withCassat our head, welcomedHenry Clay, whom the whole nation regarded as having been preserved by God for the times. He\n\nbecame our leader in that great fight, and we rallied around him the same as the Whigs\n\nrallied aroundold Hickoryin 1832, to put down nullification. (Cheers.) Thus you see that whilst Whigs and\n\nDemocrats fought fearlessly in old times about banks, the tariffs, distribution, the\n\nspecie circular, and the sub treasury, all united as a band of brothers when the peace,\n\nharmony, or integrity of the Union was imperiled. (Tremendous applause.) It was so\n\nin 1850, when abolitionism had even so far divided this country, North and South,\n\nas to endanger the peace of the Union; Whigs and Democrats united in establishing\n\nthecompromise measuresof that year, and restoring tranquillity and good feeling. These measures passed\n\non the joint action of th two parties. They rested on the great principle that the\n\npeople of each State and each territory should be left perfectly free to form and\n\nregulate their domestic institutions to suit themselves. You Whigs and we Democrats\n\njustified them in that principle. In 1854, when it became necessary to organize the\n\nterritories of Kansas and Nebraska, I brought forward the bill on the same principle.\n\nIn theKansas-Nebraska billyou find it declared to be the true intent and meaning of the act not to legislate\n\nslavery into any State or territory, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the\n\npeople thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in\n\ntheir own way. (“That’s so” and cheers.) I stand on that same platform in 1858 that\n\nI did in 1850, 1854, and 1856. TheWashingtonUnion, pretending to be the organ of the Administration, in the number of the 5th of this\n\nmonth, devotes three columns and a half to establish these propositions: First, that\n\nDouglas, in his Freeport speech, held the same doctrine that he did in hisNebraska billin 1854; second, that in 1854 Douglas justified the Nebraska bill upon the ground\n\nthat it was based upon the same principle as Clay’s compromise measures of 1850.\n\nTheUnionthus proved that Douglas was the same in 1858 that he was in 1856, 1854, and 1850,\n\nand consequently argued that he was never a Democrat. (Great laughter.) Is it not\n\nfunny that I was never a Democrat? (Renewed laughter.) There is no pretense that I\n\nhave changed a hair’s breath. TheUnionproves by my speeches that I explained the compromise measures of 1850 just as I\n\ndo now, and that I explained the Kansas and Nebraska bill in 1854 just as I did in\n\nmy Freeport speech, and yet says that I am not a Democrat, and cannot be trusted,\n\nbecause I have not changed during the whole of that time. It has occurred to me that\n\nin 1854 theauthorof the Kansas and Nebraska bill was considered a pretty good Democrat. (Cheers.)\n\nIt has occurred to me that in 1856, when I was exerting every nerve and every energy\n\nfor James Buchanan, standing on the same platform then that I do now, that I was a\n\npretty good Democrat. (Renewed applause.) They now tell me that I am not a Democrat,\n\nbecause I assert that the people of a territory, as well as those of a State, have\n\nthe right to decide for themselves whether slavery can or can not exist in such territory.\n\nLet me read what James Buchanan said on that point when he accepted the Democraticnomination for the presidency in 1856. In his letter of acceptance, he used the following language: “The recent legislation of Congress respecting domestic slavery, derived as it has\n\nbeen from the original and pure foundation of legitimate political power, the will\n\nof the majority, promises ere long to allay the dangerous excitement. This legislation\n\nis founded upon the principles as ancient as free government itself, and in accordance\n\nwith them has simply declared that the people of a territory like those of a state,\n\nshall decide for themselveswhether slavery shall or shall not exist withing their limits.” Dr. Hope will there find my answer to the question he propounded to me before I commenced\n\nspeaking. (Vociferous shouts of applause.) Of course no man will consider it an answer,\n\nwho is outside of the Democratic organization, bolts Democratic nomination, and indirectly\n\naids to put abolitionists into power over Democrats. But whether Dr. Hope considers\n\nit an answer or not, every fair minded man will see that James Buchanan has answered\n\nthe question, and has asserted that the people of a territory, like those of a State,\n\nshall decide for themselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their\n\nlimits. I answer specifically if you want a further answer, and say that while under\n\nthe decision of the Supreme Court, as recorded in the opinion ofChief Justice Taney, slaves are property like all other property and can be carried into territory of\n\nthe United States the same as any other description of property, yet when you get\n\nthem there they are subject to the local law of the territory just like all other\n\nproperty. You will find in a recent speech delivered by that able and eloquent statesman,\n\nHon.Jefferson Davis, at Bangor, Maine, that he took the same view of this subject that I did in my Freeport speech. He\n\nthere said: “If the inhabitants of any territory should refuse to enact such laws and police regulations\n\nas would give security to their property or to his, it would be rendered more or less\n\nvalueless, in proportion to the difficulties of holding it without such protection.\n\nIn the case of property in the labor of man, or what is usually called slave property,\n\nthe insecurity would be so great that the owner could not ordinarily retain it. Therefore,\n\nthough the right would remain, the remedy being withheld, it would follow that the\n\nowner would be practically debarred, by the circumstances of the case, from taking\n\nslave property into a territory where the sense of the inhabitants was opposed to\n\nits introduction. So much for the oft r peated fallacy of forcing slavery upon any community.” You will also find that the distinguished Speaker of the present House of Representatives,\n\nHon. Jas. L. Orr, construed the Kansas and Nebraska bill in this same way in 1856, and also that great\n\nintellect of the South,Alex. H. Stephens, put the same construction upon it in Congress that I did in my Freeport speech.\n\nThe whole South are rallying to support the doctrine that if the people of a Territory\n\nwant slavery they have a right to have it, and if they do not want it that no power\n\non earth can force it upon them. I hold that there is no principle on earth more\n\nsacred to all the friends of freedom than that which says that no institution, no\n\nlaw, no constitution, should be forced on a unwilling people contrary to their wishes;\n\nand I assert that the Kansas and Nebraska bill contains that principle. It is the\n\ngreat principle contained in that bill. It is the principle on which James Buchanan\n\nwas made President. Without that principle he never would have been made President\n\nof the United States, I will never violate or abandon that doctrine if I have to\n\nstand alone. (Hurrah for Douglas.) I have resisted the blandishments and threats\n\nof power on the one side, and seduction on the other, and have stood immovably for\n\nthat principle, fighting for it when assailed by Northern mobs or threatened by Southern\n\nhostility. (“That’s the truth,” and cheers.) I have defended it against the North\n\nand the South, and I will defend it against whoever assails it, and I will follow\n\nit wherever its logical conclusions lead me. (“So will we all,” “hurrah for Douglas.”)\n\nI say to you that there is but one hope, one safety for this country, and that is\n\nto stand immovably by that principle which declares the right of each State and each\n\nterritory to decide these questions for themselves. (Hear him, hear him.) This government\n\nwas founded on that principle, and must be administered in the same sense in which\n\nit was founded. But the Abolition party really think that under the Declaration of Independence the\n\nnegro is equal to the white man, and that negro equality is an inalienable right conferred\n\nby the Almighty, and hence, that all human laws in violation of it are null and void.\n\nWith such men it is no use for me to argue. I hold that the signers of the Declaration\n\nof Independence had no reference to negroes at all when they declared all men to be\n\ncreated equal. They did not mean negro, nor the savage Indians, nor the Fejee Islanders,\n\nnor any other barbarous race. They were speaking of white men. (“It’s so,” “it’s\n\nso,” and cheers.) They alluded to men of European birth and European descent—to white\n\nmen, and to none others, when they declared that doctrine. (“That’s the truth.”)\n\nI hold that this government was established on the white basis. It was established\n\nby white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever, and should\n\nbe administered by white men, and none others. But it does not follow, by any means,\n\nthat merely because the negro is not a citizen, and merely because he is not our equal,\n\nthat, therefor, he should be a slave. On the contrary, it does follow, that we ought to extend\n\nto the negro race, and to all other dependent races all the rights, all the privileges,\n\nand all the immunities which they can exercise consistently with the safety of society.\n\nHumanity requires that we should give them all these privileges; christianity commands\n\nthat we should extend those privileges to them. The question then arises what are\n\nthose privileges, and what is the nature and extent of them. My answer is that that\n\nis a question which each State must answer for itself. We in Illinois have decided\n\nit for ourselves. We tried slavery, kept it up for twelve years, and finding that\n\nit was not profitable we abolished it for that reason, and became a free State. We\n\nadopted in its stead the policy that a negro in this State shall not be a slave and\n\nshall not be a citizen. We have a right to adopt that policy. For my party I think\n\nit is a wise and sound policy for us. You in Missouri must judge for yourselves whether\n\nit is a wise policy for you. If you choose to follow our example, very good; if you\n\nreject it, still well, it is your business, not ours. So withKentucky. Let Kentucky adopt a policy to suit herself. If we do not like it we will keep\n\naway from it, and if she does not like ours let her stay at home, mind her own business\n\nand let us alone. If the people of all the States will act on that great principle,\n\nand each State mind its own business, attend to its own affairs, take care of its\n\nown negroes and not meddle with its neighbors, then there will be peace between the\n\nNorth and the South, the East and the West, throughout the whole Union. (Cheers.)\n\nWhy can we not thus have peace? Why should we thus allow a sectional party to agitate\n\nthis country, to array the North against the South, and convert us into enemies instead\n\nof friend, merely that, a few ambitious men may ride into power on a sectional hobby?\n\nHow long is it since these ambitious Northern men wished for a sectional organization?\n\nDid any one of them dream of a sectional party as long as the North was the weaker\n\nsection and the South the stronger? Then all were opposed to sectional parties; but\n\nthe moment the North obtained the majority in the House and Senate by the admission\n\nof California, and could elect a President without the aid of Southern votes, that\n\nmoment ambitious Northern men formed a scheme to excite the North against the South,\n\nand make the people be governed in their votes by geographical lines, thinking that\n\nthe North, being the stronger section, would outvote the South, and consequently they,\n\nthe leaders, would ride into office on a sectional hobby. I am told that my hour\n\nis out. It was very short. Cheers after cheer rose in the air for Douglas when he took his seat, and it was some\n\ntime before sufficient silence could be restored to allow Mr. Lincoln to proceed. REMARKS OF MR. LINCOLN. As Mr. Lincoln arose, there was a great confusion of cries and cheering. Among other\n\ncries we heard many “hurrahs for Douglas,” with “cheers for Lincoln,” and cries of\n\n“give him a chance,” “let him have a sight,” “hurrah for Lincoln,” etc. The noise having somewhat subsided, Mr. L. proceeded to say: Ladies and Gentlemen: a voice:—There are no ladies here. Mr. Lincoln:—You are mistaken about that. There is a fine chance of them back here.(Laughter.) I have been somewhat, in my own mind, complimented by a large portion of Judge Douglas’\n\nspeech — by that portion of it which he addressed to the controversy between himself\n\nand the present Administration.(Laughter, and cries of “hurrah for Lincoln,” and “hurrah for Douglas.”)This is the seventh time that Judge Douglas and I have met in these joint discussions,\n\nand the Judge, upon that subject, has been gradually improving.(A voice, “that is so,” and laughter.)In regard to his war with the Administration atQuincylast Wednesday — the day before yesterday — the Judge was a little more severe upon\n\nthe Administration that I had heard him be upon any former occasion, and I complimented\n\nhim for it, and I told him that I altogether commended him to a most vigorous prosecution\n\nof that war. I told him to give it to them with all the power he had; and, as some\n\nof them were sitting there present, I told them I would be much obliged to them if\n\nthey would give it to him in about the same way; and I felt that as he h s vastly improved upon the attack that he made then, that he has really taken my advice\n\nupon the subject, all I can say now is to recommend to him and to them what I then\n\ncommended, to him and them — the prosecution of the war in the most vigorous style.\n\nI say, “go it husband and go it bear.” There is one thing, however, that I will mention before I leave this branch of the\n\nsubject, although I do not consider that it is much of my business any how, and that\n\nis where the Judge undertakes to involve Mr. Buchanan in an inconsistency. He reads\n\nsomething from Mr. Buchanan, and undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency, and\n\nhe gets something of a cheer on doing so. I would only say to the Judge, now that\n\nhe is valiantly fighting for the Nebraska bill and the repeal of theMissouri compromise, that it is but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the Missouri\n\ncompromise.(A voice — “That’s so!”)Now I want to know if Mr. Buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as has\n\nJudge Douglas? Has Judge Douglas an exclusive right to be inconsistent? Has he a\n\nmonopoly upon that subject? So far as Judge Douglas has addressed his speech to me, or about me, it is my business\n\nto pay some attention to it. I have heard the Judge two or three times state what\n\nhe stated to-day — that in a speech which I had made at Springfield, Illinois, I had\n\nin a very special manner complained that the Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott decision,\n\nhad decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States. I have omitted\n\nheretofore by some-sort of accident to notice that statement of the Judge. It has\n\nrecurred to my memory to notice it now. In point of fact it is untrue as the Judge\n\nstated it. I never have complained of the Dred Scott decision because it decided\n\nthat a negro could never be a citizen of the United States. I have the speech here,\n\nand I will thank him or any of his friends to find where I specially complained of\n\nthe decision because it decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United\n\nStates. I have done no such thing! Judge Douglas’ persistency in insisting that\n\nI have done so, has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on\n\nhis part of misrepresent me. He could not get his foundation for insisting that I\n\nwas in favor of negro equality anywhere else so well as in assuming that in regard\n\nto me. Let me tell this audience what is true in regard to this, and the means by which they\n\ncan correct me if I shall not correctly state it myself, to wit: by reference to the\n\nspeech itself, I was endeavoring to prove that the Dred Scott decision was a portion\n\nof a system to make slavery national in the United States. I pointed out in that\n\nspeech what points had been decided in that decision by the court. I mentioned that\n\nthey had decided that a negro could not be a citizen, as a fact, and I mentioned that\n\nthey had done so, as I supposed, to deprive the negro of all power of ever becoming\n\na citizen, and claiming the rights of a citizen of the United States under a certain\n\nclause of the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to the citizens\n\nof each State all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.\n\nI stated that, without making any complaint of it at all. I adduced what other points\n\nthey had decided, that the bringing of a slave in the State of Illinois, and holding\n\nhim for two years, was a matter that they would not decide as to whether it would\n\nmake him free or not; that they decided that taking him into a territory of the United\n\nStates, where an act of Congress had made it free, did not make him free because the\n\nact was unconstitutional. I mentioned all these in a lump, and taken in connection\n\nwith the Nebraska bill and the amendment ofChase, explanatory of the pretended objects of the bill, offered at the time, which was\n\nvoted down by the friends of the bill, and combing these things together and offering\n\nthem, I argued that they tended to prove a combination or conspiracy, tending to make\n\nthe institution of slavery national in the United States. In that connection, and in that way, I mentioned the decision that a negro could not\n\nbe a citizen of the United States. Now, out of that Judge Douglas builds up his beautiful\n\nfabric of my purpose to introduce a perfect, political, and social equality between\n\nthe whites and the negroes, always adding, what is not true, that I made special objection\n\nthat the decision said that a negro could not be a citizen of the United States. As this has been alluded to, and as Mr. Clay has been alluded to, I desire to place\n\nmyself in connection with him, before this people as nearly right as I may. I know\n\nwhat is the object of Judge Douglas here to-day; he knows that we are before an audience\n\nwith strong sympathies by birth, education, and otherwise, with the South, he desires,\n\ntherefore, to place me in a strong Abolition attitude. He reads on former occasions,\n\nand alludes to-day without reading, to a portion of a speech which I made at Chicago.\n\nIn his quotations as he made them on former occasions, which were quotations made,\n\nas I suppose, bringing them within what is called garbling, that is to say, taking\n\nportions of a speech which when presented do not present the entire sense of the speaker\n\nas expressed at that time. I propose, therefore, out of that same speech from which\n\nhe has presented some extracts upon former occasions, and to which he alludes to-day\n\nwithout presenting extracts, to show you an extract which he skipped over — one before\n\nit and one after it — leaving the portion he has alluded to out. It will take me\n\nsome little time, but still I think that I will occupy the time in that way. You have heard him t0-day frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard to\n\nthe Declaration of Independence. I confess to you that I have had a struggle with\n\nJudge Douglas in the way of argument in regard to that matter, and I will try to place\n\nmyself right in regard to it briefly on this occasion. I said — and it is between\n\nthese extracts that Judge Douglas has taken his extracts and put them in his published\n\nspeeches — I said: “It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impress\n\nthem upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man that he must\n\nsubmit to it. I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we\n\nestablished this government. We had slavery among us — we could not get our constitution\n\nunless we permitted them to remain in slavery — we could not secure the good we did\n\nsecure if we grasped for more, and having by necessity submitted to that much, it\n\ndoes not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let that character\n\nstand as our standard.” Now, I have clearly and upon all occasions declared, as strongly as Judge Douglas,\n\nthat we have no right to interfere with the institution of slavery where it exists.\n\nYou hear me read that from the same speech that he takes garbled extracts from, for\n\nthe purpose of proving me to be inclined to establish perfect political and social\n\nequality between the whites and the negroes. Let me show one other extract from a speech of mine made a year ago — more than a\n\nyear ago at Springfield, in discussing this very same question, soon after Judge Douglas\n\ntook his ground that the negro was not included in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nI said several things, some of which I will read. I said then: “I think the author of that noble instrument intended to include all men, but they\n\ndid not intend to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say\n\nall were equal in color, size or intellect, moral development or social capacity.\n\nThey defined with tolerable distinctness in what respect they did consider all men\n\ncreated equal — equal with ‘certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty,\n\nand the pursuit of happiness.’ This they said, and this they meant. They did not\n\nmean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality,\n\nnor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had\n\nno power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right so that the\n\nenforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant\n\nto set up a standard maxim for free men, which should be familiar to all and revered\n\nby all, constantly looked to and constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly\n\nattained, constantly approximated and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its\n\ninfluence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors\n\neverywhere.” There again are the sentiments that I have expressed in regard to the Declaration\n\nof Independence, upon a former occasion, which have been put in print, and have been\n\nread everywhere that anybody cared to know anything about what so humble an individual\n\nas myself might say in regard to it. AtGalesburg, the other day, I said in my speech, in answer to Judge Douglas, that three years\n\nago there had never been a man, so far as I knew or believed, in the whole world that\n\nhad declared that the Declaration of Independence did not mean the negro; that the\n\nterm “all men” in the Declaration of Independence did not include the negro. I reassert\n\nthat to-day; I assert to-day, that Judge Douglas and all his friends may search the\n\nwhole of the records of the country, and it will be a matter of great astonishment\n\nto me if they shall be able to find that any one human being on earth, three years\n\nago, had ever uttered that, to me, astounding sentiment, that the term “all men” does\n\nnot include the negro. Do not let me be misunderstood. I know that more than three years ago there were\n\nmen that, finding that old documents standing in their way in regard to their purpose\n\nof extending slavery, denied the truth of it — I know that Mr.Calhounand the politicians of his school, more than three years ago, denied the truth of\n\nit — I know that it ran along through the mouths of several for years, ending in that\n\nrather coarse expression, as I have heard it, ofPettitof Indiana, on the floor of the United States Senate, that the Declaration of Independence,\n\nin that respect, was a self-evident lie, rather than a self-evident truth; but I say\n\nstill, that it is my opinion that three years ago there never had lived the man, who\n\nventured in the sneaking way of pretending to believe in the Declaration then to say,\n\nthat it did not mean to include the negro. I believe the first man that ever said\n\nthat was Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case, and the next to him, was our\n\nfriend Judge Douglas,(cries of “Good for Douglas,” and applause,)and now it is becoming the catch word of the entire party. I would like to call upon\n\nJudge Douglas’ friends everywhere to consider how they have come to view that matter\n\nin so short a time, so entirely different from any view that they had of it before,\n\nand to consider whether, really, they are not being carried along in a current, whither\n\nthey know not. But in answer to this presentation of this proposition of mine at Galesburg last week,\n\nI see that some man in Chicago has gotten up a letter, addressed to theChicago Times, to show, as he believes, that somebody had said so before, and he signs his name\n\nto his letter “An Old Line Whig,” as I remember it. Now, in the first place, I say that he was not an old line Whig.\n\nI am somewhat acquainted with the old line Whigs — I was with the old line Whigs from\n\nthe origin of that party to the end of it, and I am somewhat acquainted with it, and\n\nI know that there is no one of them but had more sense than to attempt to prove that,\n\nprior to the time I said, any one had said that a negro was not included in the term\n\n“all men” by such evidence as he produced. I will reproduce his evidence. He brings forward part of a speech of Henry Clay,\n\nand the part of a speech from Henry Clay which I would myself bring forward to prove\n\nthe contrary. Now, let us read that portion of Henry Clay’s speech. I guess we are\n\nsurrounded in some part here by old friends of Henry Clay, and they like to hear anything\n\nfrom him.(A voice — “Henry Clay was a mighty good man.”)In Indiana a man had presented a petition to Mr. Clay to liberate his negroes, and\n\nMr. Clay made a speech in answer to him, wh ch I suppose he carefully wrote out himself, and which was published, and which I have\n\nbefore me, and an extract from that speech is the evidence which this pretended old\n\nline Whig brought forward to prove what he asserted in contradiction of what I have\n\nasserted: “And what is the foundation of this appeal to me in Indiana to liberate the slaves\n\nunder my care in Kentucky? It is a general declaration in the act annonncing to the world the independence of the thirteen American colonies, that all men are\n\ncreated equal. Now, as an abstract principle, there is no doubt of the truth of that\n\ndeclaration, and it is desirable, in the original construction of society, and in\n\norganized societies, to keep it in view, as a great fundamental principle. But then,\n\nI apprehend that in no society that ever did exist, or ever shall be formed, was or\n\ncan the equality asserted among the members of the human race be practically enforced\n\nand carried out. There are portions of it, large portions, women, minors, insane,\n\nculprits, transient sojourners, that will always probably remain subject to the government\n\nof another portion of the community. That declaration, whatever may be the extent of its import, was made by the delegations\n\nof the thirteen States. In most of them slavery existed and had long existed, and\n\nwas established by law. It was introduced and forced upon the colonies by the paramount\n\nlaw ofEngland. Do you believe that, in making that declaration, the States that concurred in it\n\nintended that it should be tortured into a virtual emancipation of all the slaves\n\nwithin their respective limits?— WouldVirginiaand the older Southern States have ever united in a declaration which was to be interpreted\n\ninto an abolition of slavery among them? Did any one of the thirteen States entertain\n\nsuch a design or expectation? To impute such a secret and unavowed purpose would be\n\nto charge a political fraud upon the noblest band of patriots that ever assembled\n\nin council — a fraud upon the union of those States, whose Constitution not only recognized\n\nthe lawfulness of slavery, but permitted the importation of slaves fromAfricauntil the year 1808.” This is the entire quotation that was brought forward for the purpose of proving that\n\nsomebody had said, prior to three years ago, that the term “all men” in the Declaration\n\nof Independence did not include negroes. How does it do it? What tendency has it\n\nto prove it? Mr. Clay says, it is true, that we cannot practically apply it in all\n\ncases, and he illustrates by bringing forward the case of females, minors, insane,\n\nculprits, and so on, but he says that it is true as an abstract principle, and it\n\nis desirable in the formation of new societies, and even in organized societies, that\n\nit should be constantly kept in view as an abstract principle. Let me add a few words more which was not brought in. Mr. Clay says, a little further\n\non: “I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery.\n\nI look upon it as a great evil, and deeply lament that we have derived it from the\n\nparental government, and from our ancestors. I wish every slave in the United States\n\nwas in the country of his ancestors. But here they are, and the question is, how\n\nthey can be best dealt with? If a state of nature existed, and we were about to lay\n\nthe foundations of society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should be\n\nto incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements.” These were the sentiments of Henry Clay, he say, “if a state of nature existed, and\n\nwe were about to lay the foundation of society, no man would be more strongly opposed\n\nthan I should be to incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements.” Now,\n\nwe have in this same book, this same speech that is brought forward for the purpose\n\nof trying to prove that Mr. Clay said prior to three years ago, that the negro was\n\nnot intended in the Declaration of Independence no such statement at all; but we have\n\nthe declaration that it is a great fundamental principle that should be constantly\n\nkept in view in the organization of new societies, and in societies already organized,\n\nthat all men are created equal. But, if I say a word about it — if I attempt, as\n\nMr. Clay said that all good men should do, to keep it in view — if I ask in relation\n\nto the organization of new societies that the public eye should be turned upon it,\n\nforthwith I am villified everywhere. What have I done in regard to the Declaration of Independence that I have not the\n\nlicense of Henry Clay to do? Have I done aught in reverence to the organization of\n\nnew societies, and in this organized society, but as he recommended, of holding up\n\nto public view that grand fundamental principle of free society?(Applause.)And when the new principle — this new proposition that no human being every thought\n\nof three years ago is brought forward, I combat it as having an evil tendency, if\n\nnot an evil design; combat it as having a tendency to dis-humanize the man, to take\n\naway from him all right to be supposed or considered as human; I combat it, therefore,\n\nas being one of the thousand and one things doing in these days for the purpose of\n\npreparing the public mind for making property and nothing but property of the negro\n\nin all the States of this Union.(Applause, and cries of “Hurrah for Lincoln!” and “Hurrah for Douglas!”) But there is a point that I wish, before leaving this, to ask your attention further\n\nto, which I have read, but I wish again to pass over it, to ask your attention to\n\nit. Mr. Clay says: “I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery.\n\nI look upon it as a great evil, and deeply lament that we have derived it from the\n\nparental government and from our ancestors. I wish every slave in the United States\n\nwas in the country of his ancestors. But here they are, and the question is how\n\nthey can be best dealt with? If a state of nature existed, and we were about to lay\n\nthe foundations of society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should be\n\nto incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements.” Now, then, the principle that I had insisted upon, and all the principle that I have\n\ninsisted upon, from the Declaration of Independence, as applicable to this discussion\n\nand thiscanvass, is in relation to laying the foundations of new societies. I have never sought\n\nto apply this principle to those old States where slavery exists for the purpose of\n\nabolishing slavery in those States. It is nothing but gross perversion to assume\n\nthat I have brought forth the Declaration of Independence to ask that Missouri shall\n\nfree her slaves. I will propose no such thing at all; but when Mr. Clay says that\n\nin laying the foundations of new societies he would be opposed to the introduction\n\nof this element, I insist that in the speech of Mr. Clay we have his warrant, his\n\nlicense, for insisting upon the exclusion of that element which he declared in such\n\nstrong and emphatic language was most hateful to him.(Cries of “good” and some applause, and a voice — “We want white men; we don’t want\n\nniggers.”) Judge Douglas, in this connection, has referred to a Springfield speech of mine, in\n\nwhich I said, “a house divided against itself cannot stand.” Now, if you please,\n\nI will address myself for a little while to something that springs from that Springfield\n\nspeech. The Judge has often made the entire quotation from that speech, and I can\n\nmake it myself. I used this language: We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted for the avowed object\n\nand with the confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the\n\noperation of that policy the agitation has not only ceased, but has constantly augmented.\n\nIn my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed.\n\n‘A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this Government cannot endure\n\npermanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved —\n\nI do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided.\n\nIt will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will\n\nthe arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest\n\nin the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will\n\npush it forward until it becomes alike lawful in all the States — old as well as new,\n\nNorth as well as South.” That quotation, and the sentiment expressed in it, have been extremely offensive to\n\nJudge Douglas. He was warred upon them as Satan does upon the Bible. He has never\n\ngiven it up, and his perversions upon it are endless. Now, hear my views for a little\n\nwhile in regard to that same thing. I said that we were “now far into the fifth year\n\nsince a policy was instituted for the avowed object, and with the confident promise,\n\nof putting an end to slavery agitation.” Is not that so? When did the Nebraska bill\n\ncome forward? Four years ago the fourth day of January last, and we are far into\n\nthe fifth year since then. Was not the avowed object of that bill to put an end to\n\nslavery agitation? We were to have no more agitation of the slavery question in Congress,\n\nno more in the States, and it was all to be confined to the territories. But here\n\nI will remark, as Judge Douglas is very fond of complimenting Mr.Crittendenabout this time, that he said that there was a falsehood in it, that there was no\n\nslavery agitation at the time the bill was introduced, and that the bill was itself\n\nthe means of stirring it up again.(Applause.)But was it not introduced with the purpose and confident promise of putting an end\n\nto slavery agitation? Why, every speech that he (Douglas) made until he got into theimbroglio, I believe you call it, with the administration, was to the effect that it was the\n\npurpose of that bill to put an end to the agitation of the question of slavery — that\n\nthe last kink of its tail was just drawing out of sight. I have said that “under\n\nthe operation of that policy, that agitation has only not ceased, but has constantly\n\naugmented.” Is not that true? When was that agitation so great as to-day? There was a collateral object which was to clothe the people of the territory with\n\na power they had never had before. The first and main object of putting an end to\n\nslavery agitation had not succeeded. The second and collateral one of conferring\n\na higher degree of self-government is a question of fact to be determined by you,\n\nin answer to a question that I will put to you now: have you ever known of a people\n\non the face of the earth that ever had as little to do with the application of this\n\nprinciple as in the first instance of its use, the people of Kansas, in the application\n\nof this same right of self-government in its main and collateral objects? It has\n\nbeen nothing but a living, creeping lie from the time of its introduction to this\n\nday.(Applause.) But I have said that “the agitation,” as I think, “will not cease until a crisis shall\n\nhave been reached and passed.” I have said in what way I suppose that crisis may\n\nbe reached and passed. I have said that it may go one way or the other. I have said\n\nthat it may be passed by arresting the further spread of it, and by bringing the public\n\nmind to rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction, and I have\n\nsaid, and I repeat, that my wish is that the further spread of it should be arrested,\n\nand that it should be placed where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it\n\nis in course of ultimate extinction.(Applause).I have expressed that as my wish, and I have no disposition to shrink from it, but\n\nI have a disposition to be not misrepresented about it. I have a disposition to not\n\nhave it believed by any honest man that I desire to go to war with Missouri. Not\n\nat all! I entertain the opinion upon evidence sufficient to my mind, that the fathers\n\nof this government placed the institution of slavery among them when the public mind\n\ndid rest in the belief that it was in course of ultimate extinction. Let me ask you,\n\nif they did not, why did they make provision that the source of slavery — the African\n\nslave trade — might be cut off at the end of twenty years? Why did they make provision\n\nthat in all the territories that were held at that time slavery should be inhibited?\n\nWhy cut it off in one direction, and prevent its spread in another, if it was not\n\nthat they placed in the course of ultimate extinction? In the Constitution slavery\n\nis but referred to three times, and covert language is then used, as I suppose. What\n\nis the language in regard to the prohibition of the slave trade? It runs in this\n\nway: “The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall\n\nthink proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year one thousand\n\neight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not\n\nexceeding ten dollars for each person.” The next allusion in the constitution to the institution of slavery and the black\n\nrace, as I suppose, is as to the basis of representation, and there the language that\n\nthey use is: “Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which\n\nmay be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall\n\nbe determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound\n\nto service for a term of years, and excluding Indians, not taxed, three-fifths of\n\nall other persons.” No negro mentioned — no slaves mentioned, but the “three-fifths of all other persons”\n\ncan be applied to no other class of persons, among us, and did mean slaves. Lastly,\n\nthe provisions for the reclamation of fugitive slaves. There it is said: “No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping\n\ninto another shall, in consequence of any law or regulation thereof, be discharged\n\nfrom such service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the parties to whom\n\nsuch service or labor may be due.” There again there is no mention of the negro, or of slavery. In all three of these\n\nplaces, being the only allusions in the constitution to the institution of slavery\n\nat all, — covert language is used — language is used not at all suggestive that slavery\n\nexists, or, that the black race of people is among us, and I understand the cotemporaneous\n\nhistory of the times to be, that that language was used with a purpose, and that purpose\n\nwas that our constitution, which, it was hoped — and it is still read by intellectual\n\nmen — that there should be nothing on the face of that instrument that should suggest\n\nto the mind that we have negro slavery among us. This being so, this is part of the\n\nevidence that the fathers of the government intended and expected the institution\n\nto come to an end. They expected and intended that it was, as they placed it, in\n\nthe course of ultimate extinction, and when I say that I desire to see the further\n\nspread of it arrested, I only say that I desire to see that thing done that they then\n\ndid; when I say that I desire to see it placed where the public mind will rest in\n\nthe belief of its ultimate extinction, I only say that I desire to see it placed where\n\nthey placed it. It is not true, so far as I may understand it, that our fathers, as Judge Douglas\n\nassumes it, that our fathers made this government part slave, and part free. It is\n\nnot true that they made it so in the sense that Judge Douglas put it. He assumes that slavery, as a rightful thing within itself, was introduced by the\n\nframers of our Constitution. In that sense, then, it is not true that the framers\n\nof our Constitution made this government part slave and part free. The exact truth\n\nis that they found the institution existing among us and they left it as they found\n\nit, not making it so, with a thousand marks of disapprobation upon it. It is not\n\ntrue, as assumed, that our fathers made it so, but they found it that way and they\n\nleft it among us, because of the difficulties and absolute impossibility of the immediate\n\nremoval of it, and when Judge Douglas turns and asks me why it is that we cannot let\n\nit remain as our fathers made it, he asks a question based upon an assumption which\n\nis itself a falsehood, and I turn upon him and ask him when he found that policy which\n\nthe fathers of the government had adopted — this policy among us, the best policy\n\nin the world, and the only policy that we can ever get upon that shall give us peace,\n\nunless it masters us all and puts us down, and becomes a lawful institution alike\n\neverywhere? I turn upon him and ask him why he could not leave it alone?(Applause.)I turn and ask him what is the reason he was driven to the necessity — what was the\n\nreason he was pressed to the necessity of introducing a new policy in regard to the\n\nmatter, as he has himself said that he introduced a new policy — as he so said in\n\nhis speech of 22d March, 1858? I ask only in this controversy that we shall again place this institution upon the\n\nbasis that our fathers placed it upon; I ask no more than that, and now I ask you,\n\nwhere he infers that I am in favor of setting the slaves and free States at war, the\n\none with the other; does he not do me injustice? The institution being placed in\n\nthat attitude by those who made the Constitution, did it make war? If we had no war\n\nwhen it was thus placed, where is the ground of belief that we shall have war upon\n\nreturning to that policy? I have proposed nothing more than this! Now, I confess very frankly that when I propose a certain measure of policy, that\n\nit is not enough for me to show that I do not intend a wicked and evil purpose; I\n\nhave to show that it has not a tendency to that result. I have tried to show this\n\nby fair reasoning, and I think, in the minds of fair, reasoning men, I have shown\n\nthat I propose nothing other that has a most peaceful tendency. It is part and parcel of the same thing, the quotation which I, in that Springfield\n\nspeech, happened to make, that “a house divided against itself cannot stand.”\n\nThat is exceedingly offensive to Judge Douglas. It is but part and parcel of the\n\nsame thing. He tries to illustrate that variety in the different institutions of\n\nthe several States is indispensible. I shall readily agree with him, that it would be very foolish in us to insist upon\n\nhaving a cranberry law in Illinois, where we have no cranberries, because they have\n\none in Indiana, where they have cranberries. I should think it would be very foolish\n\nin us to insist that Virginia has no right to have an oyster law because we don’t\n\nwant an oyster law. I understand that the variety in soil, climate, in the face of\n\nthe country, and consequent variety in the people and institutions of the country,\n\nand further consequent variety in legislation, are vast advantages. I understand\n\nas well as he, I repeat, that if we raise a barrel of flour more than we want, andLouisianaraises a barrel of sugar more than she wants, that it is a material advantage to\n\nboth of us that we exchange them, it makes a mutual commerce, it makes us better friends,\n\nit brings us together, and I understand that these differences and varieties are the\n\ncement in part that bind this Union together, and instead of being things that divide\n\nthe house, and tend to throw it down, they are the props tending strongly to hold\n\nit up; but when I have said all this, I ask if there is any parallel between these\n\nthings and the institution of slavery among us? I ask if there is any parallel at\n\nall between the things? I ask you to consider well if we have any difficulty or quarrel\n\namong ourselves about the cranberry laws of Indiana, or the oyster laws of Virginia,\n\nor about the timber laws of Maine and New Hampshire, or about the fact that Louisiana\n\nproduces sugar and we produce flour and not sugar. When have we have quarrels about\n\nthese things? Never so such thing. On the other hand, when have we had perfect peace\n\nin regard to this thing, which I say is an element of discord in this nation? We\n\nhave sometimes had peace, and when was that? We have had peace whenever the institution\n\nof slavery remained quiet where it was, and we have had turmoil and difficulty whenever\n\nit has made a struggle to spread out where it was not. I ask, then, if experience\n\ndoes not teach, if it does not speak in thunder tones, that that policy that gives\n\npeace being returned to, gives promise of peace again. You may say, and Judge Douglas may say, that all that is said in regard to slavery\n\nis the mere agitation of office seekers, — of northern men that want to get his place,\n\nI suppose. I agree that there is selfishness enough among office seekers. We are\n\ndesperately selfish, I believe the Bible says, somewhere, and I believe that I should\n\nhave discovered that fact if the Bible had not said it. I am not less selfish than\n\nother men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than is Judge Douglas. But is it new that all this agitation in regard to the subject of slavery springs\n\nfrom mere office-seekers? How many cases of dangerous agitation have we had from\n\nthat question? You go back to the Missouri compromise; to the compromise on the nullification\n\nquestion — at the bottom of which was this same slavery question; go back to the difficulties\n\nof the Texas annexation; go back to the difficulties of the times of the compromise\n\nof 1850, and you will find that the agitation sprang up upon the struggle of slavery\n\nto extend itself. But further, does it make disturbance no where but in political circles? Does it not enter into the church, please? What divided\n\nthe greatMethodist Church, North and South? What makes the disturbance in everyPresbyterianGeneral Assembly that gets together? What made the disturbance in this city a few\n\nyears ago in the Unitarian church? What set them by the ears in the great American Tract Society, not splitting it yet but surely to split it? Is this the thing that so operates\n\nupon the minds of men as to stir them up in all the relations of life, not merely\n\nin the political world, but in the moral and religious; is that, however, to be assuaged\n\nby pretending that it is an exceedingly small thing and that we ought to quit talking\n\nabout it? Why, if you will get everybody else to quit talking about it I will quit\n\nbefore you have half done. But where is the statesmanship in saying that you can quiet that disturbing element\n\nmenacing us with the only danger to our Union — where is the philosophy and statesmanship\n\nthat rests upon the belief that we are to say and care nothing about it. This policy\n\nhere in the North, here with Judge Douglas, at the head of which he stands, is based\n\nupon the idea that we are to care nothing about it.(A voice, “that is true.”)Now, I ask if it is not a false philosophy and false statesmanship that undertakes\n\nto build up a system of caring nothing about a thing that everybody does care a great\n\ndeal about, — that all experience has shown that everybody does care a great deal\n\nabout. The Judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to allowing the thing to\n\nbe decided exclusively by the different States for themselves. I agree very readily\n\nthat the different States have that right. He is but fighting a man of straw when\n\nhe assumes that I am contending against the right of the States to do as they please\n\nabout it. Our controversy with him is as to the new territory. We agree that when\n\nthe States come in as States, they have entire power to do as they please about the\n\nquestion. We profess that we, as citizens of a free State — as members of the confederation,\n\nthrough the general government have no power to disturb it where it is; and we profess\n\nthat we have no more inclination than power to disturb it in those States; yet we\n\nare compelled to defend ourselves against the assumption that we are waring upon in the States. We insist that it shall be kept from the territories. Judge Douglas insists that\n\nwe have no right to say anything about that; but I think that have some interest in\n\nthat as white men. Do we not wish that our surplus population may have some outlet\n\nto go to? Do we not feel an interest, in going in to that outlet that such institutions\n\nshall prevail as are pleasing to us? and it is not the sort of thing that can be divided.\n\nIf you go to a new territory opposed to slavery, and another man goes there with slaves,\n\nas equals, it turns out that he has it all his way, and you have no part in the matter.\n\nA few going into a territory with their slaves make it a slave territory, and consequently\n\na slave State. Now, let me suggest this thing in another way. How may Democrats are here? A Voice— A thousand and one! (Laughter.) Mr.Lincoln—How many Democrats have professed to come into the State of Illinois, pretending that\n\nthey desired to get rid of slavery? I guess that there are a thousand and one of\n\nthat sort.(Applause:)Now, I will ask if your policy had prevailed in a time when this country had been\n\nin a state of existence similar to the territories to-day, where you would have gone\n\nto? And when hereafter, for any cause, the free people of these States shall desire\n\nto find new homes — an outlet — if they wish to be rid of the institution of slavery,\n\nwhere will they find the place to go to? Now, irrespective of the moral question\n\n— irrespective of the question as to whether there be right or wrong in enslaving\n\nthe negro, I am still in favor of the new territory being kept free, into which free\n\nwhite men may move, fix their homes and better their conditions in life. I am in\n\nfavor of that, — not merely — I must say it here as I say it elsewhere — not merely\n\nfor our own people that are born among us, but I am in favor of an outlet for the\n\nfree white people, for new homes in which all free white men from all the world may\n\nfind place, and better their condition in life.(Applause.) I have stated upon former occasions, and I may as well do so again, what I understand\n\nto be the real issue in this controversy. There has been no issue between Judge Douglas and I on the point of my wanting to\n\nmake war between the free and slave States. I may pass that. There has been no issue\n\nbetween Judge Douglas and I on the ground of my wanting to introduce a perfect social\n\nand political equality between the white and colored races. These are false issues\n\nthat Judge Douglas has all the while tried to force this controversy upon without\n\nfoundation. The real issue in this controversy, I think, springs from a sentiment\n\nin the mind, and that sentiment is this: on the one part it looks upon the institution\n\nof slavery as being wrong, and on the part of another class, it does not look upon\n\nit as wrong. The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery as being\n\nwrong, is the sentiment of the Republican party, it is the sentiment around which\n\nall their actions and all their arguments circle, from which all their propositions\n\nradiate. They look upon slavery as a moral, social, and political wrong, and while\n\nthey contemplate it as being such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual\n\nexistence among us, for the difficulties of getting rid of it in the States, and for\n\nall the constitutional obligations thrown around it; nevertheless, they do desire\n\nto see a policy instituted that looks to the thing not growing any larger; they insist\n\nupon a policy that shall treat it as a wrong, and as the mildest policy to that end,\n\nthey look to the prevention of its growing larger, and to an end of it eventually.\n\nAll their sentiments, arguments and propositions, are brought within this range.\n\nNow I have said, and I repeat it here, if there be any man among us who does not think\n\nthat the institution of slavery is a wrong — that it is not a wrong in any one of\n\nthe aspects in which I have spoken, he is misplaced, and ought not to be among us;\n\nand, if there by a man who is so impatient of it as a wrong, as to disregard the difficulties\n\nof getting rid of it, or as to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown around\n\nit, that man too is misplaced; we disclaim sympathy with him in political action;\n\nhe is not placed properly with us. By the way, on this subject of treating it as a wrong, and limiting its spread, let\n\nme say a word. I have asked the question indirectly, what has ever threatened our\n\nown liberties and prosperity save and except this very institution of slavery? If\n\nthis be true, how do you propose to amend it? By spreading it out larger, or making\n\nit bigger? You may have a cancer upon your person, and you may not be able to cut\n\nit out at once, lest you bleed to death, but you may not treat it as a wrong by spreading\n\nit over your whole body. So with this, the way is — it is the peaceful mode to deal\n\nwith it — to prevent the spread of it into new country. That is the old fashioned\n\nway of dealing with it, the example of which our fathers have set us. On the other hand, I have said that there is a sentiment which treats it as not being\n\na wrong. That is the Democratic sentiment of to-day. I do not mean to say that every\n\nman who stands within that range, positively asserts that it is right. That class\n\nwill include all who do not say that it is right or wrong. This class all fall within\n\nthe general class of those who do not look upon it as wrong; and now, if there be\n\namong you any one that supposes that he is a Democrat can consider and proclaim himself\n\nas being as much opposed to it as any body else. I would like to reason with him\n\nawhile. You never treat it as a wrong. What other thing that you consider wrong\n\ndo you treat in that way? You, perhaps, say that it is wrong, but your leader does\n\nnot say so, and you quarrel with every one else that says it is a wrong, although\n\nyou say it yourself. We must not say anything about it in the free States, because\n\nit is not here; we must not anything about it in the slave States, because it is there;\n\nwe must not say anything about it in policies, because it will disturb the quietness\n\nof my place; and you must not speak of it in the pulpit, because it is not religion.(Applause.)There is no suitable place to oppose it; but finally you say that if they would adopt\n\nsystems of emancipation in the slave States, you would approve of it — but don’t deceive\n\nyourselves;Frank BlairandGratz Brownand their co-laborers tried that thing in Missouri that you pretend that you would\n\nlike to see. Blair and Gratz Brown tried that thing and failed, and you threw up\n\nyour hats and hurrahed for the democracy.(Applause.) More than that, take all the arguments that are made in favor of the system. Take,\n\nfirst, the system itself that you propose, and it carefully excludes the idea that\n\nthere is anything wrong in the system of slavery; the arguments that sustain that\n\npolicy carefully exclude it, and even here, to-day, you hear Judge Douglas quarrelling\n\nwith me because I utter a wish that it might come some day to an end, although Mr.\n\nClay can stand up and say that he wishes that every slave was in his own country,\n\nyet I am denounced as false to Henry Clay for expressing the wish that it may some\n\ntime, in some way, come to an end. The Democratic policy in regard to that institution\n\nwill not tolerate the merest breath expressive of the slightest opposition to it.\n\nTry it by some of Senator Douglas’ arguments. He says he don’t care whether it is\n\nvoted up or down. Now, I don’t care whether that is intended to be expressive of\n\nhis individual sentiment upon that subject, or whether it is intended to be expressive\n\nof the national policy that he desires should be carried out; it is alike valuable\n\nfor my purposes. I say that a man can logically say that if he sees no wrong in it,\n\nbut he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong. No man can say\n\nthat he does not care if a wrong is voted up or down, he cannot say that he is indifferent\n\nas to a wrong; but he must have a choice between the right or wrong. He says that\n\nwhatever community desires slavery has a right to it. He can say so logically if\n\nit is not a wrong, but if he admits that it is wrong, he cannot logically say that\n\nanybody has a right to do wrong. He says upon the score of equality, slaves should\n\nbe allowed to go into the territories the same as other property. His argument is\n\nlogical if the properties are alike, but if one is wrong and the other right, then\n\nhe cannot say that, for there is no equality between the right and the wrong. I say\n\nthat everything in the Democratic policy, in the shape it takes in legislation, in\n\nthe Dred Scott decision, in their conversations, every one carefully excludes the\n\nthought that there is any thing wrong in it whatever. That is the real issue! An issue that will continue in this country when these poor\n\ntongues of Douglas and myself shall be silent. These are the two principles that\n\nare made the eternal struggle between right and wrong, they are the two principles\n\nthat have stood face to face, one of them asserting the divine right of kings, the\n\nsame principle that says you work, you toil, you earn bread, and I will eat it. It\n\nis the same old serpent, whether it come from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride\n\nthe people of his nation, and to live upon the fat of his neighbor, or, whether it\n\ncomes from one race of men as an apology for the enslaving of another race of men.\n\nIt is the same old policy, and I expressed my gratification that the judge at Quincy\n\nannounced that he looks to no end of this controversy.(Considerable confusion here arising among the crowd — much difficulty was experienced\n\nin hearing.)Meanwhile, whenever that issue is clear, whenever we can get clear of those men that\n\nlook to no end of it, when we can get those men out of that policy, and get them on\n\nthe side of those who treat it as a wrong, there will soon be an end of it, it will\n\nthen soon be in the course of ultimate extinction. When that issue can be made, and\n\nall extraneous matter can be removed between the combatants, they can settle the matter,\n\nand it will be done peacefully, too. There is no war about it. There is no violation\n\nof the constitution, no violation of right, or, of the necessities that spring from\n\nthe actual presence of the thing. We need but that policy again, that places it where\n\nthe wisest and best men of the world originally placed it. This manBrooks, of South Carolina, once declared that when this government was first established\n\nno one expected the institution of slavery to last until this day. When he said so,\n\nhe stated a fact which I think is fully established by the history of the times; but,\n\nhe said that though the men who framed this government were wiser and better men than\n\nthe men of these days, that the men of these days had experience which their fathers\n\nhad not, and that experience had brought them the invention of the cotton-gin which\n\nhad made the perpetuation of the institution of slavery a necessity, I say that, willingly,\n\nor unwillingly, with purpose, or without purpose, Judge Douglas has been a most prominent\n\ninstrument in the changing of the basis on which our fathers originally placed it,\n\nand putting it upon Brooks’ cottin-gin basis, placing it where he openly insists that he has no desire for the end of\n\nit. I understand that I have ten minutes yet, and I will employ that time, or a portion\n\nof it, with that argument that Judge Douglas uses, while he holds to the Dred Scott\n\ndecision, that the people of a territory can some way or other decide that question\n\nfor themselves. The first thing that I say on that point is, that he frequently said before that decision\n\nthat it was a question for the courts, but now he virtually tells us that it is not\n\na question for the church. But how does he state it? He says that it needs friendly\n\nlegislation, and admits of unfriendly legislation, and that although he admits the\n\nright of the to take a slave into the territory, that with unfriendly legislation the people can\n\nreally exclude it. I look to the constitutional authority, and I take the gentleman\n\nwho looks me in the face. We will say he is a member of the territorial legislature;\n\nlike Judge Douglas, he believes that the right to take and hold slaves there is a\n\nconstitutional right. The first thing he does is to swear he will support the Constitution;\n\nand suppose his neighbor needs legislation that he may be enabled to enjoy that constitutional\n\nright, can he withhold that legislation which his neighbor needs for the enjoyment\n\nof a right which is fixed in his favor in the Constitution of the United States, which\n\nyou remember he has sworn to support without violating his oath, I ask? And more\n\nespecially can he pass unfriendly legislation without violating that oath? Why, this\n\nis a monstrous sort of talk about the Constitution of the United States! There never\n\nhas been such outrageous talk — such lawless talk — about the Constitution of the\n\nUnited States, from any man of respectability, on the assumption, which he believes,\n\nthat the right to hold slaves is a constitutional right. I don’t believe it is a\n\nconstitutional right. I believe the decision is improperly made, and go for reversing\n\nit. Judge Douglas is furious in his speech on those who go for reversing it, yet\n\nhe goes for legislating from it all its force, while he leaves it standing. I affirm\n\nhere that there never has, from the mouth of a respectable man on earth, been uttered\n\nso monstrous a doctrine.(Applause.)Why, I suppose the most of us, I know I myself, believe, the people of the southern\n\nStates are entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law; that that right is fixed\n\nin the Constitution; that it cannot be made available to them without congressional\n\nlegislation; that it is, in the Judge’s language, a barren right, and that it needs\n\nlegislation before it can be made efficient, and valuable to the persons to whom it\n\nis granted, and we, such as I, agree that that legislation should be maintained for\n\nthem. On what ground? We profess not to like that legislation, and perhaps have\n\nno great taste for running after niggers. I profess to have none — and yet we do.\n\nAt least, I yield my support to the fugitive slave law. Why? Because I do not understand\n\nthat the Constitution which gives that right can be carried out if that legislation\n\nis withheld, and if I believed that the right to hold slaves in a territory was as\n\nfirmly fixed as that is, why, on the same principle, I would be bound to give the\n\nlegislation necessary to support it, and, I say, that no man can deny his obligation\n\nto give legislation for slave property in a territory, who believes that it is a constitutional\n\nright there. No man can make such an argument that will not give an Abolitionist\n\na stronger argument to deny a fugitive slave law. Try it on and see; if that decision\n\nis correct, then that right of the slave power is as great a right as that of the\n\nslaveholder shall have his slave returned to him, and the man who argues that by unfriendly\n\nlegislation, in spite of the constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the\n\nterritory, furnishes the argument, and cannot avoid the argument upon which the Abolitionist\n\nmay deny the obligation, and may claim the power to furnish unfriendly legislation\n\nagainst the right of the slaveholder to claim his slave. I don’t know how such a\n\nargument may take before a popular audience, but I defy any man to go before a court,\n\nor a class of men whose minds are accustomed to hearing arguments of this sort, and\n\ndeny that there is a bit of difference between them. I defy any man to go before\n\nsuch a class of men — to go and make an argument for adopting unfriendly legislation\n\nin the territories, that will not give an argument against the constitutional right\n\nto a fugitive slave law. There is not such an abolitionist in all the States as Douglas. Mr. Lincoln being run down, stopped, having several minutes to spare. SENATOR DOUGLAS REPLY. Senator Douglas’ re-appearance in front of the stand was the signal for a general\n\nyell of applause, which fairly shook the earth and startled the old Mississippi which\n\nwas rolling gently along in all its majesty with a few hundred yards of the stand. Senator Douglassaid Mr. Lincoln has concluded his remarks by saying that there is no such an Abolitionist\n\nas I am in all America. (Laughter.) If he could make the Abolitionists of Illinois\n\nbelieve that, he would not have much show for the Senate. (Great laughter and applause.)\n\nLet me make the Abolitionists believe the truth of that statement and his political\n\nback is broken. (Renewed laughter.) His first criticism upon me is the expression of his hope that the war of the administration\n\nwill be prosecuted against me and the Democratic party of this State with vigor.\n\nHe wants that war prosecuted with vigor; I have no doubt of it. His hopes of success,\n\nand the hopes of his party depend solely upon it. They have no chance of destroying\n\nthe Democracy of this State except by the aid of federal patronage. (“That’s a fact,”\n\n“good,” and cheers.) He has all the federal office-holders here as his allies, (“That’s\n\nso,”) running separate tickets against the Democracy to divide the party, although\n\nthe leaders all intend to vote directly the Abolition ticket, and only leave the green-horns\n\nto vote this separate ticket who refuse to do into the Abolition camp. (Laughter\n\nand cheers) There is something really refreshing in the thought that Mr. Lincoln is\n\nin favor of prosecuting one war vigorously. (Roars of laughter.) It is the first\n\nwar I ever knew him to be in favor of prosecuting. (Renewed laughter.) It is the\n\nfirst war that I ever knew him to believe to be just or constitutional. (Laughter\n\nand cheers.) when theMexican warbeing waged, and the American army was surrounded by the enemy inMexico, he thought that war was unconstitutional, unnecessary and unjust.—(“That’s so” “you’ve\n\ngot him,” “he voted against it,” &c.) He thought it was not commenced on the rightspot. (Laughter.) When I made an incidental allusion of that kind in the joint discussion over at Charleston\n\nsome weeks ago, Lincoln, in replying, said that I, Douglas, had charged him with voting\n\nagainst supplies for the Mexican war, and then he reared up, full length, and swore\n\nthat he never voted against the supplies—that it was a slander—and caught hold ofFicklin, who sat on the stand, and said, “Here, Ficklin, tell the people that it is a lie.”\n\n(Laughter and cheers.) Well, Ficklin, who had served in Congress with him, stood up\n\nand told them all that he recollected about it. It was that whenGeorge Ashmun, ofMassachusetts, brought forward a resolution declaring the war unconstitutional, unnecessary, and\n\nunjust, that Lincoln had voted for it. “Yes,” said Lincoln, “I did.” Thus confessed\n\nthat he voted that the war was wrong, that our country was in the wrong, and consequently\n\nthat the Mexicans were in the right; but charged that I had slander him by saying\n\nthat he voted against the supplies. I never charged him with voting against the supplies\n\nin my life, because I knew that he was not in Congress when they were voted. (Tremendous\n\nshouts of laughter.) The war was commenced on the 13th day of May, 1846, and on that\n\nday we appropriated in Congress ten millions of dollars and fifty thousand men to\n\nprosecute it. During the same session we voted more men and more money, and at the\n\nnext session we voted more men and more money, so that by the time Mr. Lincoln entered\n\nCongress we had enough men and enough money to carry on the war, and had no occasion\n\nto vote any more. (Laughter and cheers.) When he got into the House, being opposed\n\nto the war, and not being able to stop the supplies, because they had all gone forward,\n\nall he could do was to follow the lead ofCorwin, and prove that the war was not begun on the right spot, and that it was unconstitutional,\n\nunnecessary, and wrong. Remember, too, that this he did after the war had been begun.\n\nIt is one thing to be opposed to the declaration of a war, another and very different\n\nthing to take sides with the enemy against your own country after the war has been\n\ncommenced. (“Good.” and cheers.) Our army was in Mexico at the time, many battles\n\nhad been fought; our citizens, who were defending the honor of their country’s flag,\n\nwere surrounded by the daggers, the guns and the poison of the enemy. Then it was\n\nthat Corwin made his speech in which he declared that the American soldiers ought\n\nto be welcomed by the Mexicans with bloody hands and hospitable graves; then it was\n\nthat Ashmun and Lincoln voted in the House of Representatives that the war was unconstitutional\n\nand unjust; and Ashmun’s resolution, Corwin’s speech, and Lincoln’s vote were sent\n\nto Mexico and read at the head of the Mexican army, to prove to them that there was\n\na Mexican party in the Congress of the United States who were doing all in their power\n\nto aid them. (“That’s the truth,” “Lincoln’s a traitor,” etc.) That a man who takes sides with the common enemy against his own country in time\n\nof war should rejoice in a war being made on me now, is very natural. (Immense applause.)\n\nAnd in my opinion, no other kind of a man would rejoice in it. (”That’s true,” “hurrah\n\nfor Douglas.” and cheers.) Mr. Lincoln has told you a great deal to-day about his being an old line Clay Whig.\n\n(“He never was.”) Bear in mind that there are a great many old Clay Whigs down in\n\nthis region. It is more agreeable, therefore, for him o talk about the old Clay Whig party than it is for him to talk Abolitionism. We did\n\nnot hear much about the old Clay Whig party up in the Abolition districts. How much\n\nof an old line Henry Clay Whig was he? Have you readGen. Singleton’s speech atJacksonville? (Yes, yes, and cheers.) You know that Gen. Singleton was, for twenty-five years,\n\nthe confidential friend of Henry Clay in Illinois, and he testified that in 1847,\n\nwhen the constitutional convention of this State was in session, the Whigs members\n\nwere invited to a Whig caucus at the house of Mr. Lincoln’sbrother-in-law, where Mr. Lincoln proposed to throw Henry Clay overboard and take upGen. Taylorin his place, giving, as his reason, that if the Whigs did not take up Gen. Taylor\n\nthe Democrats would. (Cheers and laughter.) Singleton testifies that Lincoln, in\n\nthat speech, urged, as another reason for throwing Henry Clay overboard, that the\n\nWhigs had fought long enough for principle and ought to begin to fight for success.\n\nSingleton also testifies that Lincoln’s speech did have the effect of cutting Clay’s\n\nthroat, and that he, Singleton, and others withdrew from the caucus in indignation.\n\nHe further states that when they got toPhiladelphiato attend thenational conventionof the Whig party, that Lincoln was there, the bitter and deadly enemy of Clay, and\n\nthat he tried to keep him (Singleton) out of the convention because he insisted on\n\nvoting for Clay, and Lincoln was determined to have Taylor. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nSingleton says that Lincoln rejoiced with very great joy when he found the mangled\n\nremains of the murdered Whig statesman lying cold before him. Now, Mr. Lincoln tells\n\nyou that he is an old line Clay Whig! (Laughter and cheers.) Gen. Singleton testifies\n\nto the facts I have narrated in a public speech which has been printed and circulated\n\nbroadcast over the States for weeks, yet not a lisp have we heard from Mr. Lincoln\n\non the subject, except that he is an old Clay Whig. What part of Henry Clay’s policy did Lincoln ever advocate? He was in Congress in\n\n1848-9 when theWilmot provisowarfare disturbed the peace and harmony of the country until it shook the foundation\n\nof the republic from its centre to its circumference. It was that agitation that brought Clay forth from his retirement\n\nat Ashland again to occupy his seat in the Senate of the United States, to see if\n\nhe could not, by his great wisdom and experience, and the renown of his name, do something\n\nto restore peace and quiet to a disturbed country. Who got up that sectional strife\n\nthat Clay had to be called upon to quell? I have heard Lincoln boast that he voted forty-two times for the Wilmot\n\nproviso, and that he would have voted as many times more if he could. (Laughter.)\n\nLincoln is the man, in connection withSeward, Chase, Giddings, and other Abolitionists, who got up that strife that I helped Clay\n\nto put down. (Tremendous applause.) Henry Clay came back to the Senate in 1849, and\n\nsay that he must do something to restore peace to the country. The Union Whigs and\n\nthe Union Democrats welcomed him the moment he arrived, as the man for the occasion.\n\nWe believed that he, of all men on earth, had been preserved by Divine Providence\n\nto guide us out of our difficulties, and we Democrats rallied under Clay then, as\n\nyou Whigs in nullification time rallied under the banner of oldJackson, forgetting party when the country was in danger, in order that we might have a country\n\nfirst, and parties afterwards. (“Three cheers for Douglas.”) And this reminds me that Mr. Lincoln told you that the slavery question was the only\n\nthing that ever disturbed the peace and harmony of the Union. Did not nullification\n\nonce raise its head and disturb the peace of this Union in 1832? Was that the slavery\n\nquestion, Mr. Lincoln? Did not disunion raise its monster head during thelast war with Great Britain? Was that the slavery question, Mr. Lincoln? The peace of this country has been\n\ndisturbed three times, once during the war withGreat Britain, once on the tariff question, and once on the slavery question. (\"Three cheers for\n\nDouglas\") His argument, therefore, that slavery is the only question that has ever\n\ncreated dissension in the Union falls to the ground. It is true that agitators are\n\nenabled now to use this slavery question for the purpose of sectional strife. (“That’s\n\nso.”) He admits that in regard to all things else, the principle that I advocate,\n\nmaking each State and territory free to decide for itself ought to prevail. He instances\n\ncranberry laws, and the oyster laws, and he might have gone though the whole list with the same effect. I say that all these laws are local and domestic,\n\nand that local and domestic concerns should be left to each State and each territory\n\nto manage for itself. If agitators would acquiesce in that principle, there never\n\nwould be any danger to the peace and harmony of this Union. (“That’s so,” and cheers.) Mr. Lincoln tries to avoid the main issues by attacking the truth of my proposition,\n\nthat our fathers made this government divided into free and slave States, recognizing\n\nthat the right of each to decide all its local questions for itself. Did they not\n\nthus make it? It is true that they did not establish slavery in any of the States,\n\nor abolish it in any of them; but finding thirteen States twelve of which were slave\n\nand one free, they agreed to form a government uniting them together, as they stoo divided into free and slave States, and to guarantee forever to each State the right\n\nto do as it pleased on the slavery question. (Cheers.) Having thus made the government,\n\nand conferred this right upon each State forever, I assert that this government can\n\nexist as they made it, divided into free and slave States, if any one State chooses\n\nto retain slavery. (Cheers.) He says that he looks forward to a time when slavery\n\nshall be abolished everywhere. I look forward to a time when each State shall be\n\nallowed to do as it pleases. If it chooses to keep slavery forever, it is not my\n\nbusiness, but its own; if it chooses to abolish slavery, it is its own business—not\n\nmine. I care more for the great principle of self-government, the right of the people\n\nto rule, that I do for all the negroes in Christendom. (Cheers.) I would not endanger\n\nthe perpetuity of this Union. I would not blot out the great inalienable rights of\n\nthe white men for all the negroes that ever existed. (Renewed applause.) Hence, I\n\nsay, let us maintain this government on the principles that our fathers made it, recognizing\n\nthe right of each State to keep slavery as long as it people determine, or to abolish\n\nit when they please. (Cheers.) But Mr. Lincoln says that when our fathers made this\n\ngovernment they did not look forward to the state of things now existing; and therefore\n\nhe thinks the doctrine was wrong; and he quotes Brooks, of South Carolina, to prove\n\nthat our fathers then thought that probably slavery would be abolished, by each State\n\nacting for itself before this time. Suppose they did; suppose they did not foresee\n\nwhat has occurred,—does that change the principles of our government? They did not\n\nprobably foresee the telegraph that transmits intelligence by lightning, nor did they\n\nforesee the railroads that now form the bonds of union between the different States,\n\nor the thousand mechanical inventions that have elevated mankind. But do these things\n\nchange the principles of the government? Our fathers, I say, made this government\n\non the principle of the right of each State to do as it pleases in its own domestic\n\naffairs, subject to the constitution, and allowed the people of each to apply to every\n\nnew change of circumstance such remedy as they may see fit to improve their condition.\n\nThis right they have for all time to come. (Cheers.) Mr. Lincoln went on to tell you that he does not at all de ire to interfere with slavery in the States where it exists, nor does his party. I expected\n\nhim to say that down here. (Laughter.) Let me ask him then how he is going to put\n\nslavery in the course of ultimate extinction everywhere, if he does not intend to\n\ninterfere with it in the States where it exists? (Renewed laughter.) He says that\n\nhe will prohibit it in all territories, and the inference is then that unless they\n\nmake free States out of them he will keep them out of the Union; for, mark you, he\n\ndid not say whether or not he would vote to admit Kansas with slavery or not, as her\n\npeople might apply; (he forgot that as usual, &c;) he did not say whether or not he was in favor of bringing the territories now in\n\nexistence into the Union on the principle of Clay’s compromise measures on the slavery\n\nquestion. I told you that he would not. (Give it to him, he deserves it, &c.) His idea is that he will prohibit slavery in all the territories, and thus force\n\nthem all to become free States, surrounding the slave States with a cordon of free\n\nStates, and hemming them in, keeping the slaves confined to their present limits whilst\n\nthey go on multiplying until the soil on which they live will no longer feed them,\n\nand he will thus be able to put slavery in the course of ultimate extinction by starvation.\n\n(Cheers.) He will extinguish slavery in the Southern States as the French general\n\nexterminated the Algerines when he smoked them out. He is going to extinguish slavery\n\nby surrounding the slave States, hemming in the slaves, and starving them out of existence\n\nas you smoke a fix out of his hole. And he intends to do that in the name of humanity\n\nand Christianity, in order that we may get rid of the terrible crime and sin entailed\n\nupon our fathers of holding slaves. (Laughter and cheers). Mr. Lincoln makes out\n\nthat line of policy, and appeals to the moral sense of justice, and to the Christian\n\nfeeling of the community to sustain him. He says that any man who holds to the contrary\n\ndoctrine is in the position of the king who claimed to govern by divine right. Let\n\nus examine for a moment and see what principle it was that overthrew the divine right\n\nofGeorge the Thirdto govern us. Did not these colonies rebel because theBritish parliamenthad no right to pass laws concerning our property and domestic and private institutions\n\nwithout our consent? We demanded that the British government should not pass such\n\nlaws unless they gave us representation in the body passing them,—and this the British\n\ngovernment insisting on doing,—we went towar, on the principle that the home government should not control and govern distant\n\ncolonies without giving them a representation. Now, Mr. Lincoln proposes to govern\n\nthe territories without giving the people a representation, and calls on Congress\n\nto pass laws controlling their property and domestic concerns without their consent\n\nand against their will. Thus, he asserts for his party the identical principle asserted\n\nby George III and the tories of theRevolution. (Cheers.) I ask you to look into these things, and then to tell me whether the democracy or\n\nthe abolitionists are right. I hold that the people of a territory, like those of\n\na States, (I use the language of Mr. Buchanan in his letter of acceptance,) have the\n\nright to decide for themselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their\n\nlimits. (“That’s the idea,” “Hurrah for Douglas.”) They point upon which Chief Justice\n\nTaney expresses his opinion is simply this, that slaves being property, stand on an\n\nequal footing with other property, and consequently that the owner has the same right\n\nto carry that property into a territory that he has any other, subject to the same\n\nconditions. Suppose that one of your merchants was to take fifty or one hundred thousand\n\ndollars worth of liquors to Kansas. He has a right to go there under that decision,\n\nbut when he gets there he finds the Maine liquor law in force, and what can he do\n\nwith his property after he gets it there? He cannot sell it, he cannot use it, it\n\nis subject to the local law, and that law is against him, and the best thing he can\n\ndo with it is to bring it back into Missouri or Illinois and sell it. If you take\n\nnegroes to Kansas, as Col. Jeff. Davis said in his Bangor speech, from which I have quoted to-day, you must take them\n\nthere subject to local law. If the people want the institution of slavery they will\n\nprotect and encourage it; but if they do not want it they will withhold that protection,\n\nand the absence of local legislation protecting slavery excludes it as completely\n\nas a positive prohibition. (“That’s so, and cheers.) You slaveholders of Missouri\n\nmight as well understand what you know practically, that you cannot carry slavery\n\nwhere the people do not want it. (“That’s so.”) All you have a right to ask is that\n\nthe people shall do as they please; if they want slavery let them have it; if they\n\ndo not want it, allow them to refuse to encourage it. My friends, if, as I have said before, we will only live up to this great fundamental\n\nprinciple there will be peace between the North and the South. Mr. Lincoln admits t at under the constitution on all domestic questions, except slavery, we ought not to\n\ninterfere with the people of each State. What right have we to interfere with slavery\n\nany more than we have to interfere with any other question. He says that this slavery\n\nquestion is now the bone of contention. Why? Simply because agitators have combined\n\nin all the free States to make war upon it. Suppose the agitators in the States should\n\ncombine in one-half of the Union to make war upon the railroad system of the other\n\nhalf? They would thus be driven to the same sectional strife. Suppose one section\n\nmakes war upon any other peculiar institution of the opposite section, and the same\n\nstrife is produced. They only remedy and safety is that we shall stand by the constitution\n\nas our fathers made it, obey the laws, as they are passed, while they stand the proper\n\ntest and sustain the decisions of the Supreme Court and the constituted authorities. Senator Douglas’ half hour here expired. For some minutes after he concluded, the\n\napplause was perfectly deafening and overwhelming. He seemed to have carried his\n\nvast auditory entirely with him, in sympathy and feeling, for their enthusiasm was\n\nboundless.",

      "The Last Joint Debate! DOUGLASANDLINCOLN. SENATOR DOUGLAS’ SPEECH. Long and loud bursts of applause greeted Senator Douglas when he appeared on the",
      "stand. As he was about to commence speaking, he was interrupted byDr. Hope, one of the Danite1faction. Dr. Hope.—Judge, before you commence speaking, allow me to ask you a question. Senator Douglas.—If you will not occupy too much of my time. Dr. Hope.—Only an instant. Senator Douglas.—What is your question? Dr. Hope.—Do you believe that the Territorial legislatures ought to pass laws to protect slavery",
      "in the territories? Senator Douglas.—You will get an answer in the course of my remarks. (Applause.) Ladies and Gentlemen: It is not nearly four months since thecanvassbetween Mr. Lincoln and myself commenced. On the 16th of June theRepublican Conventionassembled atSpringfieldand nominated Mr. Lincoln as their candidate for theU.S. Senate, and he, on that occasion, delivered a speech in which he laid down what he understood",
      "to be theRepublicancreed and the platform on which he proposed to stand during the contest. The principal",
      "points in that speech of Mr. Lincoln’s were: first, that this government could not",
      "endure permanently divided into free and slave States, as our fathers made it; that",
      "they must all become free or all become slave; all become one thing or all become",
      "the other, otherwise the Union could not continue to exist. I give you his opinions",
      "almost in the identical language he used. His second proposition was a crusade against",
      "theSupreme Court of the United Statesbecause of theDred Scott decision; urging as an especial reason for his opposition to that decision that it deprived",
      "the negroes of the rights and benefits of that clause in the Constitution of the United",
      "States which guarantees to the citizens of each States, all the rights, privileges,",
      "and immunities of the citizens of the several States. On the 1oth of July I returned",
      "home, and delivered a speech to the people ofChicago, in which I announced it to be my purpose to appeal to the people ofIllinoisto sustain the course I had pursued inCongress. In that speech I joined issue with Mr. Lincoln on the points which he had presented.",
      "Thus there was an issue clear and distinct made up between us on these two propositions",
      "laid down in the speech of Mr. Lincoln at Springfield, and controverted by me in my",
      "reply to him at Chicago. On the next day, the 11th of July, Mr. Lincoln replied to",
      "me at Chicago, explaining at some length, and re-affirming the positions which he",
      "had taken in his Springfield speech. In that Chicago speech he even went further",
      "than he had before, and uttered sentiments in regard to the negro being on an equality",
      "with the white man. (That’s so.) He adopted in support of this position the argument",
      "whichLovejoyandCodding, and otherAbolitionlecturers had made familiar in the northern and central portions of theState, to wit: that the Declaration of Independence having declared all men free and equal,",
      "by Divine law, also that negro equality was an inalienable right, of which they could",
      "not be deprived. He insisted, in that speech, that the Declaration of Independence",
      "included the negro in the clause asserting that all men were created equal, and went",
      "so far as to say that if one man was allowed to take the position, that it did not",
      "include the negro, others might take the position that it did not include other men.",
      "He said that all these distinctions between this man and that man, this race and the",
      "other race, must be discarded, and we must all stand by the Declaration of Independence,",
      "declaring that all men were created equal. The issue thus being made up between Mr. Lincoln and myself on three points, we went",
      "before the people of the State. During the following seven weeks, between the Chicago",
      "speeches and our first meeting atOttawa, he and I addressed large assemblages of the people in many of the central counties.",
      "In my speeches I confined myself closely to those three positions which he had taken",
      "controverting his proposition that this Union could not exist as our fathers made",
      "it, divided into free and slave States, controverting his proposition of a crusade",
      "against the Supreme Court because of the Dred Scott decision, and controverting his",
      "proposition that the Declaration of Independence included and meant the negroes as",
      "well as the white men, when it declared all men to be created equal. (Cheers for",
      "Douglas). I supposed at that time that these propositions constituted a distinct issue",
      "between us, and that the opposite positions we had taken upon them we would be willing",
      "to be held to in every part of the State. I never intended to waver one hair’s breadth",
      "from that issue either in the north or the south, or wherever I should address the",
      "people of Illinois. I hold that when the time arrives that I cannot proclaim my political",
      "creed in the same terms not only in the northern but the southern part of Illinois,",
      "not only in the northern but the southern States, and wherever the American flag waves",
      "over American soil, that then there must be something wrong in that creed. (“Good,",
      "good,” and cheers.) So long as we live under a common constitution, so long as we",
      "live in a confederacy of sovereign and equal States, joined together as one for certain",
      "purposes, that any political creed is radically wrong which cannot be proclaimed in",
      "every State, and every section of that Union alike. I took up Mr. Lincoln’s three",
      "propositions in my several speeches, analyzed them, and pointed out what I believed",
      "to be the radical errors contained in them. First, in regard to his doctrine that",
      "this government was in violation of the law of God which say, that a house divided",
      "against itself cannot stand, I repudiated it as a slander upon the immortal framers",
      "of our constitution. I then said, have often repeated, and now again assert, that",
      "in my opinion this government can endure forever, (good,) divided into free and slave",
      "States as our fathers made it,—each State having the right to prohibit, abolish, or",
      "sustain slavery just as it pleases. (“Good,” “right,” and cheers.) This government",
      "was made upon the great basis of the sovereignty of the States, the right of each",
      "State to regulate its own domestic institutions to suit itself, and that right was",
      "conferred with understanding and expectation that inasmuch as each locality had separate",
      "interests, each locality must have different and distinct local and domestic institutions,",
      "corresponding to its wants and interests. Our fathers knew when they made the government,",
      "that the laws and institutions which were well adapted to the green mountains ofVermont, were unsuited to the rice plantations ofSouth Carolina. They knew then, as well as we know now, that the laws and institutions which would",
      "be well adapted to the beautiful prairies of Illinois would not be suited to the mining",
      "regions ofCalifornia. They knew that in a Republic as broad as this, having such a variety of soil, climate",
      "and interest, there must necessarily be a corresponding variety of local laws—the",
      "policy and institutions of each State adapted to its condition and wants. For this",
      "reason this Union was established on the right of each State to do as it pleased on",
      "the question of slavery, and every other question; and the various States were not",
      "allowed to complain of, much less interfere, with the policy of their neighbors.",
      "(“That’s good doctrine,” “that’s the doctrine,” and cheers.) Suppose the doctrine advocated by Mr. Lincoln and the abolitionists of this day had",
      "prevailed when the Constitution was made, what would have been the result? Imagine",
      "for a moment that Mr. Lincoln had been a member of the convention that framed the",
      "Constitution of the United States, and that when its members were about to sign that",
      "wonderful document, he had arisen in that convention as he did at Springfield this",
      "summer, and addressing himself to the President, had said “a house divided against",
      "itself cannot stand; (laughter,) this government divided into free and slave States",
      "cannot endure, they must all be free or all be slave, they must all be one thing or",
      "all be the other, otherwise, it is a violation of the law of God, and cannot continue",
      "to exist;”—supposed Mr. Lincoln had convinced that body of sages, that that doctrine",
      "was sound, what would have been the result? Remember that the Union was then composed",
      "of thirteen States, twelve of which were slaveholding andonefree. Do you think that the one free State would have outvoted the twelve slaveholding",
      "States, and thus have secured the abolition of slavery?—(No, no.) On the other hand,",
      "would not the twelve slaveholding States have outvoted the one free State, and thus",
      "have fastened slavery, by a Constitutional provision, on every foot of the American",
      "Republic forever? You see that if this abolition doctrine of Mr. Lincoln had prevailed",
      "when the government was made it would have established slavery as a permanent institution,",
      "in all the States whether they wanted it or not, and the question for us to determine",
      "is Illinois now as one of the free States is, whether or not we are willing, having",
      "become the majority section, to enforce a doctrine on the minority, which we would",
      "have resisted with our heart’s blood had it been attempted on us when we were in a",
      "minority. (“We never will,” good, good, and cheers.) How has the South lost her power",
      "as the majority section in this Union, and how have the free States gained it, except",
      "under the operation of that principle which declares the right of people of each State",
      "and each territory to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way.",
      "It was under that principle that slavery was abolished inNew Hampshire,Rhode Island,Connecticut,New York,New Jersey, andPennsylvania; it was under that principle that one half of the slaveholding States became free;",
      "it was under that principle that the number of free States increased until from being",
      "one out of twelve States, we have grown to be the majority of States of the whole",
      "Union, with the power to control theHouse of Representativesand Senate, and the power, consequently, to elect as President by Northern votes",
      "without the aid of a Southern State. Having obtained this power under the operation",
      "of that great principle, are you now prepared to abandon the principle and declare",
      "that merely because we have the power you will wage a war against the Southern States",
      "and their institutions until you force them to abolish slavery everywhere. (No, never,",
      "and great applause.) After having pressed these arguments home on Mr. Lincoln for seven weeks, publishing",
      "a number of my speeches, we met at Ottawa in joint discussion, and he then began to",
      "crawfish a little, and let himself down. (Immense applause.) I there propounded certain",
      "questions to him. Amongst others, I asked him whether he would vote for the admission",
      "of any more slave States in the event the people wanted them. He would not answer.",
      "(Applause and laughter.) I then told him that if he did not answer the question there",
      "I would renew it atFreeport, and would then trot him down intoEgyptand again put it to him. (Cheers.) Well, at Freeport, knowing that the next joint",
      "discussion took place in Egypt, and being in dread of it, he did answer my question",
      "in regard to no more slave States in a mode which he hoped would be satisfactory to",
      "me, and accomplish the object he had in view. I will show you what he answer was.",
      "After saying that he was not pledged to the Republican doctrine of “no more slave",
      "States,” he declared “I state to you freely, frankly, that I should be exceedingly sorry to ever be put",
      "in a position of having to pass upon that question. I should be exceedingly glad",
      "to know that there never would be another slave State admitted into this Union.” Here, permit to remark, that I do not think the people will ever force him into a",
      "position against his will. (Great laughter and applause.) He went on to say: “But I must add in regard to this, that if slavery shall be kept out of the territory",
      "during the territorial existence of any one given territory and then the people should,",
      "having a fair chance and clear field when they come to adopt a constitution, if they",
      "should do the extraordinary thing of adopting a slave constitution, uninfluenced by",
      "the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own",
      "the country, but we must admit it into the Union.” That answer Mr. Lincoln supposed would satisfy the old-lineWhigs, composed ofKentuckiansandVirginians, down in the southern part of the State. Now, what does it amount to? I desire",
      "to know whether he would vote to allowKansasto come into the Union with slavery or not, as her people desired. He would not",
      "answer; but in a round about way said that if slavery should be kept out of a territory",
      "during the whole of its territorial existence, and then the people, when they adopted",
      "a State constitution, asked admission as a slave State, he supposed he would have",
      "to let the State come in. The case I put to him was an entirely different one. I",
      "desired to know whether he would vote to admit a State if Congress had not prohibited",
      "slavery in it during its territorial existence, as Congress never pretended to do",
      "underClay’scompromise measures of 1850. He would not answer, and I have not yet been able to get an answer fr m him. (Laughter, “he’ll answer this time,” “he’s afraid to answer,” etc.) I have asked him whether he would vote to admitNebraskaif her people asked to come in as a State with a constitution recognizing slavery,",
      "and he refused to answer. (“Put him through,” “give it to him,” and cheers.) I have",
      "put the question to him with reference toNew Mexico, and he has not uttered a word in answer. I have enumerated the territories, one",
      "after another, putting the same question to him with reference to each, and he has",
      "not said, and will not say, whether, if elected to Congress, he will vote to admit",
      "any territory now in existence with such a constitution as her people may adopt.",
      "He invents a case which does not exist, and cannot exist under this government, and",
      "answers it; but he will not answer the question I put to him in connection with any",
      "of the territories now in existence. (“Hurrah for Douglas,” “three cheers for Douglas.”)",
      "The contract we entered into withTexaswhen she entered the Union obliges us to allow four States to be formed out of the",
      "old State, and admitted with or without slavery as the respective inhabitants of each",
      "may determine. I have asked Mr. Lincoln three times in our joint discussions whether",
      "he would vote to redeem that pledge, and he has never yet answered. He is as silent",
      "as the grave on the subject. (Laughter, “Lincoln must answer,” “he will,” &c.) He would rather answer as to a state of the case which will never arise than commit",
      "himself by telling what he would do in a case which would come up for his action soon",
      "after his election to Congress. (“He’ll never have to act on any question,” and laughter.)",
      "Why can he not say whether he is willing to allow the people of each State to have",
      "slavery or not as they please, and to come into the Union when they have the requisite",
      "population as a slave or a free State as they decide? I have no trouble in answering",
      "the question. I have said everywhere, and now repeat it to you, that if the people",
      "of Kansas want a slave State they have a right, under the constitution of the United",
      "States, to form such a State, and I will let them come into the Union with slavery",
      "or without, as they determine. (“That’s right,” “good,” “hurrah for Douglas all the",
      "time,” and cheers.) If the people of any other territory desire slavery let them have",
      "it. If they do not want it let them prohibit it. It is their business not mine.",
      "(“That’s it exactly,” “that’s so,” hurrah, &c.) It is none of our business in Illinois whetherKansasis a free State or a slave State. (“That’s the doctrine.”) It is none of your business",
      "inMissouriwhether Kansas shall adopt slavery or reject it. It is the business of her people",
      "and none of yours. The people of Kansas has as much right to decide that question",
      "for themselves as you have in Missouri to decide it for yourselves, or we in Illinois",
      "to decide it for ourselves. (“That’s what we believe,” “We stand by that,” and cheers.) And here I may repeat what I have said in every speech I have made in Illinois, that",
      "I fought theLecompton constitutionto its death, not because of the slavery clause in it, but because it was not the",
      "act and deed of the people of Kansas. I said then in Congress, and I say now, that",
      "if the people of Kansas want a slave State, they have a right to have it. If they",
      "wanted the Lecompton constitution, they had a right to have it. I was opposed to",
      "that constitution because I did not believe that it was the act and deed of the people,",
      "but on the contrary, the act of a small, pitiful minority acting in the name of the",
      "majority. When at last it was determined to send that constitution back to the people,",
      "and accordingly, in August last, the question of admission under it was submitted",
      "to a popular vote, the citizens rejected it by nearly ten to one, thus showing conclusively,",
      "that I was right when I said that the Lecompton constitution was not the act and",
      "deed of the people of Kansas, and did not embody their will. (Cheers.) I hold that there is no power on earth, under our system of government, which has",
      "the right to force a constitution upon an unwilling people. (That’s so.) Suppose",
      "there had been a majority of ten to one in favor of slavery in Kansas, and suppose",
      "there had been an abolition President, and an abolition administration, and by some",
      "means the abolitionists succeeded in forcing an abolition constitution on those slaveholding",
      "people, would the people of the South have submitted to that act for one instant.",
      "(No, no.) Well, if you of the South would not have submitted to it a day, how can",
      "you, as fair, honorable and honest men insist on putting a slave constitution on a",
      "people who desire a free State. (“That’s so,” and cheers.) Your safety and ours depend",
      "upon both of us acting in good faith, and living up to that great principle which",
      "asserts the right of every people to form and regulate their domestic institutions",
      "to suit themselves, subject only to the Constitution of the United States. (“That’s",
      "the doctrine,” and immense applause.) Most of the men who denounced my course on theLecomptonquestion, objected to it not because I was not right, but because they thought it",
      "expedient at that time, for the sake of keeping the party together, to do wrong.",
      "(Cheers.) I never knew theDemocratic partyto violate any one of its principles out of policy or expediency, that it did not",
      "pay the debt with sorrow. There is no safety or success for our party unless we always",
      "do right, and trust the consequences to God and the people. I chose not to depart",
      "from principle for the sake of expediency in the Lecompton question, and I never intend",
      "to do it on that or any other question. (Good.) But I am told that I would have been all right if I had only voted for theEnglishbill after Lecompton was killed. (Laughter and cheers.) You know a general pardon",
      "was granted to all political offenders on the Lecompton question, provided they would",
      "only vote for the English bill. I did not accept the benefits of that pardon, for",
      "the reason that I had been right in the course I had pursued, and hence did not require",
      "any forgiveness. Let us see how the result has beon worked out. English brought in his bill referring the Lecompton Constitution back",
      "to the people, with the provision that if it was rejected Kansas should be kept out",
      "of the Union until she had the full ratio of population required for a member of",
      "Congress, thus in effect declaring that if the people of Kansas would only consent",
      "to come into the Union under the Lecompton Constitution, and have a slave State when",
      "they did not want it, they should be admitted with a population of 35,000, but that",
      "if they were so obstinate as to insist upon having just such a constitution as a free",
      "State, then they should be kept out until they had 93,420 inhabitants. I then said,",
      "and I now repeat tO you, that whenever Kansas has people enough for a slave State she has people enough",
      "for a free State. (“That’s the doctrine all over,” “Hurrah for Douglas.”) I was and",
      "am willing to adopt the rule that no State shall ever come into the Union until she",
      "has the full ratio of population for a member of Congress, provided that rule is made",
      "uniform. I made that proposition in the Senate last winter, but a majority of the",
      "Senators would not agree to it; and I then said to them if you will not adopt the",
      "general rule I will not consent to make an exception of Kansas. I hold that it is a violation of the fundamental principles of this government to",
      "throw the weight of federal power into the scale, either in favor of the free or the",
      "slave States. Equality among all the States of this Union is a fundamental principle",
      "in our political system. We have no more right to throw the weight of the federal",
      "government into the scale in favor of the slaveholding than the free States, and last",
      "of all should our friends in the South consent for a moment that Congress should withhold",
      "its powers either way when they know that there is a majority against them in both",
      "Houses of Congress. Fellow citizens, how have the supporters of the English bill stood up to their pledges",
      "not to admit Kansas until she obtained a population of 93,420 in the event she rejected",
      "the Lecompton constitution? How? The newspapers inform us that English himself, whilst",
      "conducting his canvass for re-election, and in order to secure it, pledged himself",
      "to his constituents that if returned he would disregard his own bill and vote to admit",
      "Kansas into the Union with such population as she might have when she made application.",
      "(Laughter and applause.) We are informed that every Democratic candidate for Congress",
      "in all the States where elections have recently been held, was pledged against the",
      "English bill, with perhaps one or two exceptions. Now, if I had only done as these",
      "Anti-Lecompton men who voted for the English bill in Congress, pledging themselves",
      "to refuse to admit Kansas if she refused to become a slave State until she had a population",
      "of 93,420, and then returned to their people, forfeited their pledge, and made a new",
      "pledge to admit Kansas at any time she applied, without regard to population, I would",
      "have had no trouble. You saw the whole power and patronage of the federal government",
      "wielded inIndiana,Ohio, andPennsylvaniato re-elect Anti-Lecompton men to Congress who voted against Lecompton, then voted",
      "for the English bull, and then denounced the En lish bill, and pledged themselves to their people to disregard it. (Good.) My sin consists",
      "in not having given a pledge, and then in not having afterwards forfeited it. For",
      "that reason, in this State, every postmaster, every route agent, every collector of",
      "the ports, and every federal office holder, forfeits his head the moment he expresses",
      "a preference for the Democratic candidates against Lincoln and his abolition associates.",
      "(That’s so, and cheers.) ADemocratic Administrationwhich we helped to bring to power, deems it consistent with its fidelity to principle",
      "and its regard to duty, to wield its power in this State in behalf of the Republican",
      "abolition candidates in every county and every Congressional district against the",
      "Democratic party. All I have to say in reference to the matter is, that if that administration",
      "have not regard enough for principle, if they are not sufficiently attached to the",
      "creed of the Democratic party to bury forever their personal hostilities in order",
      "to succeeed in carrying out our glorious principles, I have. (Good, good, and cheers.) I have",
      "no personal difficulties with Mr.Buchananor his cabinet. He chose to make certain recommendations to Congress as he had a",
      "right to do on the Lecompton question. I could not vote in favor of them. I had",
      "as much right to judge for myself how I should vote as he had how he should recommend.",
      "He undertook to say to me, if you do not vote as I tell you, I will take off the",
      "heads of your friends. (Laughter.) I replied to him, “you did not elect me, I represent",
      "Illinois and I am accountable to Illinois, as my constituency, and to God, but not",
      "to the President or to any other power on earth. (Good, good, and vociferous applause.) And now this warfare is made on me because I would not surrender my connections of",
      "duty, because I would not abandon my constituency, and receive the order of the executive",
      "authorities how I should vote in the Senate of the United States. (“Never do it,”",
      "“three cheers,” &c.) I hold that an attempt to control the Senate on the part of the Executive is subversive",
      "of the principles of our constitution. (“That’s right.”) The Executive department",
      "is independent of the Senate, and the Senate is independent of the President. In",
      "matters of legislation the President has a veto on the action of the Senate, and in",
      "appointments and treaties the Senate has a veto on the President. He has no more",
      "right to tell me how to I shall vote on his appointments that I have to tell him whether",
      "he shall veto or approve a bill that the Senate has passed. Whenever you recognize",
      "the right of the Executive to say to a Senator, “do this, or I will take off the heads",
      "of your friends,” you convert this government from a republic into a despotism. (Hear,",
      "hear, and cheers.) Whenever you recognize the rights of a President to say to a member",
      "of Congress, “vote as I tell, or I will bring a power to bear against you at home",
      "which will crush you,” you destroy the independence of the representative, and convert",
      "him into a tool of Executive power. (“That’s so, and applause.) I resisted this invasion",
      "of the constitutional rights of a Senator, and I intend to resist it as long as I",
      "have a voice to speak, or a vote to give. Yet, Mr. Buchanan cannot provoke me to",
      "abandon one iota of Democratic principles out of revenge or hostility to his course.",
      "(“Good, good, three cheers for Douglas.”) I stand by the platform of the Democratic",
      "party, and by its organization, and support its nominees. If there are any who choose",
      "to bolt, the fact only shows that they are not as good Democrats as I am. (“That’s",
      "so, “good,” and applause.) My friends, there never was a time when it was as important for the Democratic party,",
      "for all national men, to rally and stand together as it is to-day. We find all sectional men giving up past differences and continuing the one question",
      "of slavery, and when we find sectional men thus uniting, we should unite to resist",
      "them and their treasonable designs. Such was the case in 1850, when Clay left the",
      "quiet and peace of his home, and again entered upon public life to quell agitation",
      "and restore peace to a distracted Union. Then we Democrats, withCassat our head, welcomedHenry Clay, whom the whole nation regarded as having been preserved by God for the times. He",
      "became our leader in that great fight, and we rallied around him the same as the Whigs",
      "rallied aroundold Hickoryin 1832, to put down nullification. (Cheers.) Thus you see that whilst Whigs and",
      "Democrats fought fearlessly in old times about banks, the tariffs, distribution, the",
      "specie circular, and the sub treasury, all united as a band of brothers when the peace,",
      "harmony, or integrity of the Union was imperiled. (Tremendous applause.) It was so",
      "in 1850, when abolitionism had even so far divided this country, North and South,",
      "as to endanger the peace of the Union; Whigs and Democrats united in establishing",
      "thecompromise measuresof that year, and restoring tranquillity and good feeling. These measures passed",
      "on the joint action of th two parties. They rested on the great principle that the",
      "people of each State and each territory should be left perfectly free to form and",
      "regulate their domestic institutions to suit themselves. You Whigs and we Democrats",
      "justified them in that principle. In 1854, when it became necessary to organize the",
      "territories of Kansas and Nebraska, I brought forward the bill on the same principle.",
      "In theKansas-Nebraska billyou find it declared to be the true intent and meaning of the act not to legislate",
      "slavery into any State or territory, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the",
      "people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in",
      "their own way. (“That’s so” and cheers.) I stand on that same platform in 1858 that",
      "I did in 1850, 1854, and 1856. TheWashingtonUnion, pretending to be the organ of the Administration, in the number of the 5th of this",
      "month, devotes three columns and a half to establish these propositions: First, that",
      "Douglas, in his Freeport speech, held the same doctrine that he did in hisNebraska billin 1854; second, that in 1854 Douglas justified the Nebraska bill upon the ground",
      "that it was based upon the same principle as Clay’s compromise measures of 1850.",
      "TheUnionthus proved that Douglas was the same in 1858 that he was in 1856, 1854, and 1850,",
      "and consequently argued that he was never a Democrat. (Great laughter.) Is it not",
      "funny that I was never a Democrat? (Renewed laughter.) There is no pretense that I",
      "have changed a hair’s breath. TheUnionproves by my speeches that I explained the compromise measures of 1850 just as I",
      "do now, and that I explained the Kansas and Nebraska bill in 1854 just as I did in",
      "my Freeport speech, and yet says that I am not a Democrat, and cannot be trusted,",
      "because I have not changed during the whole of that time. It has occurred to me that",
      "in 1854 theauthorof the Kansas and Nebraska bill was considered a pretty good Democrat. (Cheers.)",
      "It has occurred to me that in 1856, when I was exerting every nerve and every energy",
      "for James Buchanan, standing on the same platform then that I do now, that I was a",
      "pretty good Democrat. (Renewed applause.) They now tell me that I am not a Democrat,",
      "because I assert that the people of a territory, as well as those of a State, have",
      "the right to decide for themselves whether slavery can or can not exist in such territory.",
      "Let me read what James Buchanan said on that point when he accepted the Democraticnomination for the presidency in 1856. In his letter of acceptance, he used the following language: “The recent legislation of Congress respecting domestic slavery, derived as it has",
      "been from the original and pure foundation of legitimate political power, the will",
      "of the majority, promises ere long to allay the dangerous excitement. This legislation",
      "is founded upon the principles as ancient as free government itself, and in accordance",
      "with them has simply declared that the people of a territory like those of a state,",
      "shall decide for themselveswhether slavery shall or shall not exist withing their limits.” Dr. Hope will there find my answer to the question he propounded to me before I commenced",
      "speaking. (Vociferous shouts of applause.) Of course no man will consider it an answer,",
      "who is outside of the Democratic organization, bolts Democratic nomination, and indirectly",
      "aids to put abolitionists into power over Democrats. But whether Dr. Hope considers",
      "it an answer or not, every fair minded man will see that James Buchanan has answered",
      "the question, and has asserted that the people of a territory, like those of a State,",
      "shall decide for themselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their",
      "limits. I answer specifically if you want a further answer, and say that while under",
      "the decision of the Supreme Court, as recorded in the opinion ofChief Justice Taney, slaves are property like all other property and can be carried into territory of",
      "the United States the same as any other description of property, yet when you get",
      "them there they are subject to the local law of the territory just like all other",
      "property. You will find in a recent speech delivered by that able and eloquent statesman,",
      "Hon.Jefferson Davis, at Bangor, Maine, that he took the same view of this subject that I did in my Freeport speech. He",
      "there said: “If the inhabitants of any territory should refuse to enact such laws and police regulations",
      "as would give security to their property or to his, it would be rendered more or less",
      "valueless, in proportion to the difficulties of holding it without such protection.",
      "In the case of property in the labor of man, or what is usually called slave property,",
      "the insecurity would be so great that the owner could not ordinarily retain it. Therefore,",
      "though the right would remain, the remedy being withheld, it would follow that the",
      "owner would be practically debarred, by the circumstances of the case, from taking",
      "slave property into a territory where the sense of the inhabitants was opposed to",
      "its introduction. So much for the oft r peated fallacy of forcing slavery upon any community.” You will also find that the distinguished Speaker of the present House of Representatives,",
      "Hon. Jas. L. Orr, construed the Kansas and Nebraska bill in this same way in 1856, and also that great",
      "intellect of the South,Alex. H. Stephens, put the same construction upon it in Congress that I did in my Freeport speech.",
      "The whole South are rallying to support the doctrine that if the people of a Territory",
      "want slavery they have a right to have it, and if they do not want it that no power",
      "on earth can force it upon them. I hold that there is no principle on earth more",
      "sacred to all the friends of freedom than that which says that no institution, no",
      "law, no constitution, should be forced on a unwilling people contrary to their wishes;",
      "and I assert that the Kansas and Nebraska bill contains that principle. It is the",
      "great principle contained in that bill. It is the principle on which James Buchanan",
      "was made President. Without that principle he never would have been made President",
      "of the United States, I will never violate or abandon that doctrine if I have to",
      "stand alone. (Hurrah for Douglas.) I have resisted the blandishments and threats",
      "of power on the one side, and seduction on the other, and have stood immovably for",
      "that principle, fighting for it when assailed by Northern mobs or threatened by Southern",
      "hostility. (“That’s the truth,” and cheers.) I have defended it against the North",
      "and the South, and I will defend it against whoever assails it, and I will follow",
      "it wherever its logical conclusions lead me. (“So will we all,” “hurrah for Douglas.”)",
      "I say to you that there is but one hope, one safety for this country, and that is",
      "to stand immovably by that principle which declares the right of each State and each",
      "territory to decide these questions for themselves. (Hear him, hear him.) This government",
      "was founded on that principle, and must be administered in the same sense in which",
      "it was founded. But the Abolition party really think that under the Declaration of Independence the",
      "negro is equal to the white man, and that negro equality is an inalienable right conferred",
      "by the Almighty, and hence, that all human laws in violation of it are null and void.",
      "With such men it is no use for me to argue. I hold that the signers of the Declaration",
      "of Independence had no reference to negroes at all when they declared all men to be",
      "created equal. They did not mean negro, nor the savage Indians, nor the Fejee Islanders,",
      "nor any other barbarous race. They were speaking of white men. (“It’s so,” “it’s",
      "so,” and cheers.) They alluded to men of European birth and European descent—to white",
      "men, and to none others, when they declared that doctrine. (“That’s the truth.”)",
      "I hold that this government was established on the white basis. It was established",
      "by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever, and should",
      "be administered by white men, and none others. But it does not follow, by any means,",
      "that merely because the negro is not a citizen, and merely because he is not our equal,",
      "that, therefor, he should be a slave. On the contrary, it does follow, that we ought to extend",
      "to the negro race, and to all other dependent races all the rights, all the privileges,",
      "and all the immunities which they can exercise consistently with the safety of society.",
      "Humanity requires that we should give them all these privileges; christianity commands",
      "that we should extend those privileges to them. The question then arises what are",
      "those privileges, and what is the nature and extent of them. My answer is that that",
      "is a question which each State must answer for itself. We in Illinois have decided",
      "it for ourselves. We tried slavery, kept it up for twelve years, and finding that",
      "it was not profitable we abolished it for that reason, and became a free State. We",
      "adopted in its stead the policy that a negro in this State shall not be a slave and",
      "shall not be a citizen. We have a right to adopt that policy. For my party I think",
      "it is a wise and sound policy for us. You in Missouri must judge for yourselves whether",
      "it is a wise policy for you. If you choose to follow our example, very good; if you",
      "reject it, still well, it is your business, not ours. So withKentucky. Let Kentucky adopt a policy to suit herself. If we do not like it we will keep",
      "away from it, and if she does not like ours let her stay at home, mind her own business",
      "and let us alone. If the people of all the States will act on that great principle,",
      "and each State mind its own business, attend to its own affairs, take care of its",
      "own negroes and not meddle with its neighbors, then there will be peace between the",
      "North and the South, the East and the West, throughout the whole Union. (Cheers.)",
      "Why can we not thus have peace? Why should we thus allow a sectional party to agitate",
      "this country, to array the North against the South, and convert us into enemies instead",
      "of friend, merely that, a few ambitious men may ride into power on a sectional hobby?",
      "How long is it since these ambitious Northern men wished for a sectional organization?",
      "Did any one of them dream of a sectional party as long as the North was the weaker",
      "section and the South the stronger? Then all were opposed to sectional parties; but",
      "the moment the North obtained the majority in the House and Senate by the admission",
      "of California, and could elect a President without the aid of Southern votes, that",
      "moment ambitious Northern men formed a scheme to excite the North against the South,",
      "and make the people be governed in their votes by geographical lines, thinking that",
      "the North, being the stronger section, would outvote the South, and consequently they,",
      "the leaders, would ride into office on a sectional hobby. I am told that my hour",
      "is out. It was very short. Cheers after cheer rose in the air for Douglas when he took his seat, and it was some",
      "time before sufficient silence could be restored to allow Mr. Lincoln to proceed. REMARKS OF MR. LINCOLN. As Mr. Lincoln arose, there was a great confusion of cries and cheering. Among other",
      "cries we heard many “hurrahs for Douglas,” with “cheers for Lincoln,” and cries of",
      "“give him a chance,” “let him have a sight,” “hurrah for Lincoln,” etc. The noise having somewhat subsided, Mr. L. proceeded to say: Ladies and Gentlemen: a voice:—There are no ladies here. Mr. Lincoln:—You are mistaken about that. There is a fine chance of them back here.(Laughter.) I have been somewhat, in my own mind, complimented by a large portion of Judge Douglas’",
      "speech — by that portion of it which he addressed to the controversy between himself",
      "and the present Administration.(Laughter, and cries of “hurrah for Lincoln,” and “hurrah for Douglas.”)This is the seventh time that Judge Douglas and I have met in these joint discussions,",
      "and the Judge, upon that subject, has been gradually improving.(A voice, “that is so,” and laughter.)In regard to his war with the Administration atQuincylast Wednesday — the day before yesterday — the Judge was a little more severe upon",
      "the Administration that I had heard him be upon any former occasion, and I complimented",
      "him for it, and I told him that I altogether commended him to a most vigorous prosecution",
      "of that war. I told him to give it to them with all the power he had; and, as some",
      "of them were sitting there present, I told them I would be much obliged to them if",
      "they would give it to him in about the same way; and I felt that as he h s vastly improved upon the attack that he made then, that he has really taken my advice",
      "upon the subject, all I can say now is to recommend to him and to them what I then",
      "commended, to him and them — the prosecution of the war in the most vigorous style.",
      "I say, “go it husband and go it bear.” There is one thing, however, that I will mention before I leave this branch of the",
      "subject, although I do not consider that it is much of my business any how, and that",
      "is where the Judge undertakes to involve Mr. Buchanan in an inconsistency. He reads",
      "something from Mr. Buchanan, and undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency, and",
      "he gets something of a cheer on doing so. I would only say to the Judge, now that",
      "he is valiantly fighting for the Nebraska bill and the repeal of theMissouri compromise, that it is but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the Missouri",
      "compromise.(A voice — “That’s so!”)Now I want to know if Mr. Buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as has",
      "Judge Douglas? Has Judge Douglas an exclusive right to be inconsistent? Has he a",
      "monopoly upon that subject? So far as Judge Douglas has addressed his speech to me, or about me, it is my business",
      "to pay some attention to it. I have heard the Judge two or three times state what",
      "he stated to-day — that in a speech which I had made at Springfield, Illinois, I had",
      "in a very special manner complained that the Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott decision,",
      "had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States. I have omitted",
      "heretofore by some-sort of accident to notice that statement of the Judge. It has",
      "recurred to my memory to notice it now. In point of fact it is untrue as the Judge",
      "stated it. I never have complained of the Dred Scott decision because it decided",
      "that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States. I have the speech here,",
      "and I will thank him or any of his friends to find where I specially complained of",
      "the decision because it decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United",
      "States. I have done no such thing! Judge Douglas’ persistency in insisting that",
      "I have done so, has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on",
      "his part of misrepresent me. He could not get his foundation for insisting that I",
      "was in favor of negro equality anywhere else so well as in assuming that in regard",
      "to me. Let me tell this audience what is true in regard to this, and the means by which they",
      "can correct me if I shall not correctly state it myself, to wit: by reference to the",
      "speech itself, I was endeavoring to prove that the Dred Scott decision was a portion",
      "of a system to make slavery national in the United States. I pointed out in that",
      "speech what points had been decided in that decision by the court. I mentioned that",
      "they had decided that a negro could not be a citizen, as a fact, and I mentioned that",
      "they had done so, as I supposed, to deprive the negro of all power of ever becoming",
      "a citizen, and claiming the rights of a citizen of the United States under a certain",
      "clause of the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to the citizens",
      "of each State all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.",
      "I stated that, without making any complaint of it at all. I adduced what other points",
      "they had decided, that the bringing of a slave in the State of Illinois, and holding",
      "him for two years, was a matter that they would not decide as to whether it would",
      "make him free or not; that they decided that taking him into a territory of the United",
      "States, where an act of Congress had made it free, did not make him free because the",
      "act was unconstitutional. I mentioned all these in a lump, and taken in connection",
      "with the Nebraska bill and the amendment ofChase, explanatory of the pretended objects of the bill, offered at the time, which was",
      "voted down by the friends of the bill, and combing these things together and offering",
      "them, I argued that they tended to prove a combination or conspiracy, tending to make",
      "the institution of slavery national in the United States. In that connection, and in that way, I mentioned the decision that a negro could not",
      "be a citizen of the United States. Now, out of that Judge Douglas builds up his beautiful",
      "fabric of my purpose to introduce a perfect, political, and social equality between",
      "the whites and the negroes, always adding, what is not true, that I made special objection",
      "that the decision said that a negro could not be a citizen of the United States. As this has been alluded to, and as Mr. Clay has been alluded to, I desire to place",
      "myself in connection with him, before this people as nearly right as I may. I know",
      "what is the object of Judge Douglas here to-day; he knows that we are before an audience",
      "with strong sympathies by birth, education, and otherwise, with the South, he desires,",
      "therefore, to place me in a strong Abolition attitude. He reads on former occasions,",
      "and alludes to-day without reading, to a portion of a speech which I made at Chicago.",
      "In his quotations as he made them on former occasions, which were quotations made,",
      "as I suppose, bringing them within what is called garbling, that is to say, taking",
      "portions of a speech which when presented do not present the entire sense of the speaker",
      "as expressed at that time. I propose, therefore, out of that same speech from which",
      "he has presented some extracts upon former occasions, and to which he alludes to-day",
      "without presenting extracts, to show you an extract which he skipped over — one before",
      "it and one after it — leaving the portion he has alluded to out. It will take me",
      "some little time, but still I think that I will occupy the time in that way. You have heard him t0-day frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard to",
      "the Declaration of Independence. I confess to you that I have had a struggle with",
      "Judge Douglas in the way of argument in regard to that matter, and I will try to place",
      "myself right in regard to it briefly on this occasion. I said — and it is between",
      "these extracts that Judge Douglas has taken his extracts and put them in his published",
      "speeches — I said: “It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impress",
      "them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man that he must",
      "submit to it. I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we",
      "established this government. We had slavery among us — we could not get our constitution",
      "unless we permitted them to remain in slavery — we could not secure the good we did",
      "secure if we grasped for more, and having by necessity submitted to that much, it",
      "does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let that character",
      "stand as our standard.” Now, I have clearly and upon all occasions declared, as strongly as Judge Douglas,",
      "that we have no right to interfere with the institution of slavery where it exists.",
      "You hear me read that from the same speech that he takes garbled extracts from, for",
      "the purpose of proving me to be inclined to establish perfect political and social",
      "equality between the whites and the negroes. Let me show one other extract from a speech of mine made a year ago — more than a",
      "year ago at Springfield, in discussing this very same question, soon after Judge Douglas",
      "took his ground that the negro was not included in the Declaration of Independence.",
      "I said several things, some of which I will read. I said then: “I think the author of that noble instrument intended to include all men, but they",
      "did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say",
      "all were equal in color, size or intellect, moral development or social capacity.",
      "They defined with tolerable distinctness in what respect they did consider all men",
      "created equal — equal with ‘certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty,",
      "and the pursuit of happiness.’ This they said, and this they meant. They did not",
      "mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality,",
      "nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had",
      "no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right so that the",
      "enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant",
      "to set up a standard maxim for free men, which should be familiar to all and revered",
      "by all, constantly looked to and constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly",
      "attained, constantly approximated and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its",
      "influence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors",
      "everywhere.” There again are the sentiments that I have expressed in regard to the Declaration",
      "of Independence, upon a former occasion, which have been put in print, and have been",
      "read everywhere that anybody cared to know anything about what so humble an individual",
      "as myself might say in regard to it. AtGalesburg, the other day, I said in my speech, in answer to Judge Douglas, that three years",
      "ago there had never been a man, so far as I knew or believed, in the whole world that",
      "had declared that the Declaration of Independence did not mean the negro; that the",
      "term “all men” in the Declaration of Independence did not include the negro. I reassert",
      "that to-day; I assert to-day, that Judge Douglas and all his friends may search the",
      "whole of the records of the country, and it will be a matter of great astonishment",
      "to me if they shall be able to find that any one human being on earth, three years",
      "ago, had ever uttered that, to me, astounding sentiment, that the term “all men” does",
      "not include the negro. Do not let me be misunderstood. I know that more than three years ago there were",
      "men that, finding that old documents standing in their way in regard to their purpose",
      "of extending slavery, denied the truth of it — I know that Mr.Calhounand the politicians of his school, more than three years ago, denied the truth of",
      "it — I know that it ran along through the mouths of several for years, ending in that",
      "rather coarse expression, as I have heard it, ofPettitof Indiana, on the floor of the United States Senate, that the Declaration of Independence,",
      "in that respect, was a self-evident lie, rather than a self-evident truth; but I say",
      "still, that it is my opinion that three years ago there never had lived the man, who",
      "ventured in the sneaking way of pretending to believe in the Declaration then to say,",
      "that it did not mean to include the negro. I believe the first man that ever said",
      "that was Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case, and the next to him, was our",
      "friend Judge Douglas,(cries of “Good for Douglas,” and applause,)and now it is becoming the catch word of the entire party. I would like to call upon",
      "Judge Douglas’ friends everywhere to consider how they have come to view that matter",
      "in so short a time, so entirely different from any view that they had of it before,",
      "and to consider whether, really, they are not being carried along in a current, whither",
      "they know not. But in answer to this presentation of this proposition of mine at Galesburg last week,",
      "I see that some man in Chicago has gotten up a letter, addressed to theChicago Times, to show, as he believes, that somebody had said so before, and he signs his name",
      "to his letter “An Old Line Whig,” as I remember it. Now, in the first place, I say that he was not an old line Whig.",
      "I am somewhat acquainted with the old line Whigs — I was with the old line Whigs from",
      "the origin of that party to the end of it, and I am somewhat acquainted with it, and",
      "I know that there is no one of them but had more sense than to attempt to prove that,",
      "prior to the time I said, any one had said that a negro was not included in the term",
      "“all men” by such evidence as he produced. I will reproduce his evidence. He brings forward part of a speech of Henry Clay,",
      "and the part of a speech from Henry Clay which I would myself bring forward to prove",
      "the contrary. Now, let us read that portion of Henry Clay’s speech. I guess we are",
      "surrounded in some part here by old friends of Henry Clay, and they like to hear anything",
      "from him.(A voice — “Henry Clay was a mighty good man.”)In Indiana a man had presented a petition to Mr. Clay to liberate his negroes, and",
      "Mr. Clay made a speech in answer to him, wh ch I suppose he carefully wrote out himself, and which was published, and which I have",
      "before me, and an extract from that speech is the evidence which this pretended old",
      "line Whig brought forward to prove what he asserted in contradiction of what I have",
      "asserted: “And what is the foundation of this appeal to me in Indiana to liberate the slaves",
      "under my care in Kentucky? It is a general declaration in the act annonncing to the world the independence of the thirteen American colonies, that all men are",
      "created equal. Now, as an abstract principle, there is no doubt of the truth of that",
      "declaration, and it is desirable, in the original construction of society, and in",
      "organized societies, to keep it in view, as a great fundamental principle. But then,",
      "I apprehend that in no society that ever did exist, or ever shall be formed, was or",
      "can the equality asserted among the members of the human race be practically enforced",
      "and carried out. There are portions of it, large portions, women, minors, insane,",
      "culprits, transient sojourners, that will always probably remain subject to the government",
      "of another portion of the community. That declaration, whatever may be the extent of its import, was made by the delegations",
      "of the thirteen States. In most of them slavery existed and had long existed, and",
      "was established by law. It was introduced and forced upon the colonies by the paramount",
      "law ofEngland. Do you believe that, in making that declaration, the States that concurred in it",
      "intended that it should be tortured into a virtual emancipation of all the slaves",
      "within their respective limits?— WouldVirginiaand the older Southern States have ever united in a declaration which was to be interpreted",
      "into an abolition of slavery among them? Did any one of the thirteen States entertain",
      "such a design or expectation? To impute such a secret and unavowed purpose would be",
      "to charge a political fraud upon the noblest band of patriots that ever assembled",
      "in council — a fraud upon the union of those States, whose Constitution not only recognized",
      "the lawfulness of slavery, but permitted the importation of slaves fromAfricauntil the year 1808.” This is the entire quotation that was brought forward for the purpose of proving that",
      "somebody had said, prior to three years ago, that the term “all men” in the Declaration",
      "of Independence did not include negroes. How does it do it? What tendency has it",
      "to prove it? Mr. Clay says, it is true, that we cannot practically apply it in all",
      "cases, and he illustrates by bringing forward the case of females, minors, insane,",
      "culprits, and so on, but he says that it is true as an abstract principle, and it",
      "is desirable in the formation of new societies, and even in organized societies, that",
      "it should be constantly kept in view as an abstract principle. Let me add a few words more which was not brought in. Mr. Clay says, a little further",
      "on: “I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery.",
      "I look upon it as a great evil, and deeply lament that we have derived it from the",
      "parental government, and from our ancestors. I wish every slave in the United States",
      "was in the country of his ancestors. But here they are, and the question is, how",
      "they can be best dealt with? If a state of nature existed, and we were about to lay",
      "the foundations of society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should be",
      "to incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements.” These were the sentiments of Henry Clay, he say, “if a state of nature existed, and",
      "we were about to lay the foundation of society, no man would be more strongly opposed",
      "than I should be to incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements.” Now,",
      "we have in this same book, this same speech that is brought forward for the purpose",
      "of trying to prove that Mr. Clay said prior to three years ago, that the negro was",
      "not intended in the Declaration of Independence no such statement at all; but we have",
      "the declaration that it is a great fundamental principle that should be constantly",
      "kept in view in the organization of new societies, and in societies already organized,",
      "that all men are created equal. But, if I say a word about it — if I attempt, as",
      "Mr. Clay said that all good men should do, to keep it in view — if I ask in relation",
      "to the organization of new societies that the public eye should be turned upon it,",
      "forthwith I am villified everywhere. What have I done in regard to the Declaration of Independence that I have not the",
      "license of Henry Clay to do? Have I done aught in reverence to the organization of",
      "new societies, and in this organized society, but as he recommended, of holding up",
      "to public view that grand fundamental principle of free society?(Applause.)And when the new principle — this new proposition that no human being every thought",
      "of three years ago is brought forward, I combat it as having an evil tendency, if",
      "not an evil design; combat it as having a tendency to dis-humanize the man, to take",
      "away from him all right to be supposed or considered as human; I combat it, therefore,",
      "as being one of the thousand and one things doing in these days for the purpose of",
      "preparing the public mind for making property and nothing but property of the negro",
      "in all the States of this Union.(Applause, and cries of “Hurrah for Lincoln!” and “Hurrah for Douglas!”) But there is a point that I wish, before leaving this, to ask your attention further",
      "to, which I have read, but I wish again to pass over it, to ask your attention to",
      "it. Mr. Clay says: “I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery.",
      "I look upon it as a great evil, and deeply lament that we have derived it from the",
      "parental government and from our ancestors. I wish every slave in the United States",
      "was in the country of his ancestors. But here they are, and the question is how",
      "they can be best dealt with? If a state of nature existed, and we were about to lay",
      "the foundations of society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should be",
      "to incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements.” Now, then, the principle that I had insisted upon, and all the principle that I have",
      "insisted upon, from the Declaration of Independence, as applicable to this discussion",
      "and thiscanvass, is in relation to laying the foundations of new societies. I have never sought",
      "to apply this principle to those old States where slavery exists for the purpose of",
      "abolishing slavery in those States. It is nothing but gross perversion to assume",
      "that I have brought forth the Declaration of Independence to ask that Missouri shall",
      "free her slaves. I will propose no such thing at all; but when Mr. Clay says that",
      "in laying the foundations of new societies he would be opposed to the introduction",
      "of this element, I insist that in the speech of Mr. Clay we have his warrant, his",
      "license, for insisting upon the exclusion of that element which he declared in such",
      "strong and emphatic language was most hateful to him.(Cries of “good” and some applause, and a voice — “We want white men; we don’t want",
      "niggers.”) Judge Douglas, in this connection, has referred to a Springfield speech of mine, in",
      "which I said, “a house divided against itself cannot stand.” Now, if you please,",
      "I will address myself for a little while to something that springs from that Springfield",
      "speech. The Judge has often made the entire quotation from that speech, and I can",
      "make it myself. I used this language: We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted for the avowed object",
      "and with the confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the",
      "operation of that policy the agitation has not only ceased, but has constantly augmented.",
      "In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed.",
      "‘A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this Government cannot endure",
      "permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved —",
      "I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided.",
      "It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will",
      "the arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest",
      "in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will",
      "push it forward until it becomes alike lawful in all the States — old as well as new,",
      "North as well as South.” That quotation, and the sentiment expressed in it, have been extremely offensive to",
      "Judge Douglas. He was warred upon them as Satan does upon the Bible. He has never",
      "given it up, and his perversions upon it are endless. Now, hear my views for a little",
      "while in regard to that same thing. I said that we were “now far into the fifth year",
      "since a policy was instituted for the avowed object, and with the confident promise,",
      "of putting an end to slavery agitation.” Is not that so? When did the Nebraska bill",
      "come forward? Four years ago the fourth day of January last, and we are far into",
      "the fifth year since then. Was not the avowed object of that bill to put an end to",
      "slavery agitation? We were to have no more agitation of the slavery question in Congress,",
      "no more in the States, and it was all to be confined to the territories. But here",
      "I will remark, as Judge Douglas is very fond of complimenting Mr.Crittendenabout this time, that he said that there was a falsehood in it, that there was no",
      "slavery agitation at the time the bill was introduced, and that the bill was itself",
      "the means of stirring it up again.(Applause.)But was it not introduced with the purpose and confident promise of putting an end",
      "to slavery agitation? Why, every speech that he (Douglas) made until he got into theimbroglio, I believe you call it, with the administration, was to the effect that it was the",
      "purpose of that bill to put an end to the agitation of the question of slavery — that",
      "the last kink of its tail was just drawing out of sight. I have said that “under",
      "the operation of that policy, that agitation has only not ceased, but has constantly",
      "augmented.” Is not that true? When was that agitation so great as to-day? There was a collateral object which was to clothe the people of the territory with",
      "a power they had never had before. The first and main object of putting an end to",
      "slavery agitation had not succeeded. The second and collateral one of conferring",
      "a higher degree of self-government is a question of fact to be determined by you,",
      "in answer to a question that I will put to you now: have you ever known of a people",
      "on the face of the earth that ever had as little to do with the application of this",
      "principle as in the first instance of its use, the people of Kansas, in the application",
      "of this same right of self-government in its main and collateral objects? It has",
      "been nothing but a living, creeping lie from the time of its introduction to this",
      "day.(Applause.) But I have said that “the agitation,” as I think, “will not cease until a crisis shall",
      "have been reached and passed.” I have said in what way I suppose that crisis may",
      "be reached and passed. I have said that it may go one way or the other. I have said",
      "that it may be passed by arresting the further spread of it, and by bringing the public",
      "mind to rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction, and I have",
      "said, and I repeat, that my wish is that the further spread of it should be arrested,",
      "and that it should be placed where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it",
      "is in course of ultimate extinction.(Applause).I have expressed that as my wish, and I have no disposition to shrink from it, but",
      "I have a disposition to be not misrepresented about it. I have a disposition to not",
      "have it believed by any honest man that I desire to go to war with Missouri. Not",
      "at all! I entertain the opinion upon evidence sufficient to my mind, that the fathers",
      "of this government placed the institution of slavery among them when the public mind",
      "did rest in the belief that it was in course of ultimate extinction. Let me ask you,",
      "if they did not, why did they make provision that the source of slavery — the African",
      "slave trade — might be cut off at the end of twenty years? Why did they make provision",
      "that in all the territories that were held at that time slavery should be inhibited?",
      "Why cut it off in one direction, and prevent its spread in another, if it was not",
      "that they placed in the course of ultimate extinction? In the Constitution slavery",
      "is but referred to three times, and covert language is then used, as I suppose. What",
      "is the language in regard to the prohibition of the slave trade? It runs in this",
      "way: “The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall",
      "think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year one thousand",
      "eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not",
      "exceeding ten dollars for each person.” The next allusion in the constitution to the institution of slavery and the black",
      "race, as I suppose, is as to the basis of representation, and there the language that",
      "they use is: “Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which",
      "may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall",
      "be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound",
      "to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians, not taxed, three-fifths of",
      "all other persons.” No negro mentioned — no slaves mentioned, but the “three-fifths of all other persons”",
      "can be applied to no other class of persons, among us, and did mean slaves. Lastly,",
      "the provisions for the reclamation of fugitive slaves. There it is said: “No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping",
      "into another shall, in consequence of any law or regulation thereof, be discharged",
      "from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the parties to whom",
      "such service or labor may be due.” There again there is no mention of the negro, or of slavery. In all three of these",
      "places, being the only allusions in the constitution to the institution of slavery",
      "at all, — covert language is used — language is used not at all suggestive that slavery",
      "exists, or, that the black race of people is among us, and I understand the cotemporaneous",
      "history of the times to be, that that language was used with a purpose, and that purpose",
      "was that our constitution, which, it was hoped — and it is still read by intellectual",
      "men — that there should be nothing on the face of that instrument that should suggest",
      "to the mind that we have negro slavery among us. This being so, this is part of the",
      "evidence that the fathers of the government intended and expected the institution",
      "to come to an end. They expected and intended that it was, as they placed it, in",
      "the course of ultimate extinction, and when I say that I desire to see the further",
      "spread of it arrested, I only say that I desire to see that thing done that they then",
      "did; when I say that I desire to see it placed where the public mind will rest in",
      "the belief of its ultimate extinction, I only say that I desire to see it placed where",
      "they placed it. It is not true, so far as I may understand it, that our fathers, as Judge Douglas",
      "assumes it, that our fathers made this government part slave, and part free. It is",
      "not true that they made it so in the sense that Judge Douglas put it. He assumes that slavery, as a rightful thing within itself, was introduced by the",
      "framers of our Constitution. In that sense, then, it is not true that the framers",
      "of our Constitution made this government part slave and part free. The exact truth",
      "is that they found the institution existing among us and they left it as they found",
      "it, not making it so, with a thousand marks of disapprobation upon it. It is not",
      "true, as assumed, that our fathers made it so, but they found it that way and they",
      "left it among us, because of the difficulties and absolute impossibility of the immediate",
      "removal of it, and when Judge Douglas turns and asks me why it is that we cannot let",
      "it remain as our fathers made it, he asks a question based upon an assumption which",
      "is itself a falsehood, and I turn upon him and ask him when he found that policy which",
      "the fathers of the government had adopted — this policy among us, the best policy",
      "in the world, and the only policy that we can ever get upon that shall give us peace,",
      "unless it masters us all and puts us down, and becomes a lawful institution alike",
      "everywhere? I turn upon him and ask him why he could not leave it alone?(Applause.)I turn and ask him what is the reason he was driven to the necessity — what was the",
      "reason he was pressed to the necessity of introducing a new policy in regard to the",
      "matter, as he has himself said that he introduced a new policy — as he so said in",
      "his speech of 22d March, 1858? I ask only in this controversy that we shall again place this institution upon the",
      "basis that our fathers placed it upon; I ask no more than that, and now I ask you,",
      "where he infers that I am in favor of setting the slaves and free States at war, the",
      "one with the other; does he not do me injustice? The institution being placed in",
      "that attitude by those who made the Constitution, did it make war? If we had no war",
      "when it was thus placed, where is the ground of belief that we shall have war upon",
      "returning to that policy? I have proposed nothing more than this! Now, I confess very frankly that when I propose a certain measure of policy, that",
      "it is not enough for me to show that I do not intend a wicked and evil purpose; I",
      "have to show that it has not a tendency to that result. I have tried to show this",
      "by fair reasoning, and I think, in the minds of fair, reasoning men, I have shown",
      "that I propose nothing other that has a most peaceful tendency. It is part and parcel of the same thing, the quotation which I, in that Springfield",
      "speech, happened to make, that “a house divided against itself cannot stand.”",
      "That is exceedingly offensive to Judge Douglas. It is but part and parcel of the",
      "same thing. He tries to illustrate that variety in the different institutions of",
      "the several States is indispensible. I shall readily agree with him, that it would be very foolish in us to insist upon",
      "having a cranberry law in Illinois, where we have no cranberries, because they have",
      "one in Indiana, where they have cranberries. I should think it would be very foolish",
      "in us to insist that Virginia has no right to have an oyster law because we don’t",
      "want an oyster law. I understand that the variety in soil, climate, in the face of",
      "the country, and consequent variety in the people and institutions of the country,",
      "and further consequent variety in legislation, are vast advantages. I understand",
      "as well as he, I repeat, that if we raise a barrel of flour more than we want, andLouisianaraises a barrel of sugar more than she wants, that it is a material advantage to",
      "both of us that we exchange them, it makes a mutual commerce, it makes us better friends,",
      "it brings us together, and I understand that these differences and varieties are the",
      "cement in part that bind this Union together, and instead of being things that divide",
      "the house, and tend to throw it down, they are the props tending strongly to hold",
      "it up; but when I have said all this, I ask if there is any parallel between these",
      "things and the institution of slavery among us? I ask if there is any parallel at",
      "all between the things? I ask you to consider well if we have any difficulty or quarrel",
      "among ourselves about the cranberry laws of Indiana, or the oyster laws of Virginia,",
      "or about the timber laws of Maine and New Hampshire, or about the fact that Louisiana",
      "produces sugar and we produce flour and not sugar. When have we have quarrels about",
      "these things? Never so such thing. On the other hand, when have we had perfect peace",
      "in regard to this thing, which I say is an element of discord in this nation? We",
      "have sometimes had peace, and when was that? We have had peace whenever the institution",
      "of slavery remained quiet where it was, and we have had turmoil and difficulty whenever",
      "it has made a struggle to spread out where it was not. I ask, then, if experience",
      "does not teach, if it does not speak in thunder tones, that that policy that gives",
      "peace being returned to, gives promise of peace again. You may say, and Judge Douglas may say, that all that is said in regard to slavery",
      "is the mere agitation of office seekers, — of northern men that want to get his place,",
      "I suppose. I agree that there is selfishness enough among office seekers. We are",
      "desperately selfish, I believe the Bible says, somewhere, and I believe that I should",
      "have discovered that fact if the Bible had not said it. I am not less selfish than",
      "other men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than is Judge Douglas. But is it new that all this agitation in regard to the subject of slavery springs",
      "from mere office-seekers? How many cases of dangerous agitation have we had from",
      "that question? You go back to the Missouri compromise; to the compromise on the nullification",
      "question — at the bottom of which was this same slavery question; go back to the difficulties",
      "of the Texas annexation; go back to the difficulties of the times of the compromise",
      "of 1850, and you will find that the agitation sprang up upon the struggle of slavery",
      "to extend itself. But further, does it make disturbance no where but in political circles? Does it not enter into the church, please? What divided",
      "the greatMethodist Church, North and South? What makes the disturbance in everyPresbyterianGeneral Assembly that gets together? What made the disturbance in this city a few",
      "years ago in the Unitarian church? What set them by the ears in the great American Tract Society, not splitting it yet but surely to split it? Is this the thing that so operates",
      "upon the minds of men as to stir them up in all the relations of life, not merely",
      "in the political world, but in the moral and religious; is that, however, to be assuaged",
      "by pretending that it is an exceedingly small thing and that we ought to quit talking",
      "about it? Why, if you will get everybody else to quit talking about it I will quit",
      "before you have half done. But where is the statesmanship in saying that you can quiet that disturbing element",
      "menacing us with the only danger to our Union — where is the philosophy and statesmanship",
      "that rests upon the belief that we are to say and care nothing about it. This policy",
      "here in the North, here with Judge Douglas, at the head of which he stands, is based",
      "upon the idea that we are to care nothing about it.(A voice, “that is true.”)Now, I ask if it is not a false philosophy and false statesmanship that undertakes",
      "to build up a system of caring nothing about a thing that everybody does care a great",
      "deal about, — that all experience has shown that everybody does care a great deal",
      "about. The Judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to allowing the thing to",
      "be decided exclusively by the different States for themselves. I agree very readily",
      "that the different States have that right. He is but fighting a man of straw when",
      "he assumes that I am contending against the right of the States to do as they please",
      "about it. Our controversy with him is as to the new territory. We agree that when",
      "the States come in as States, they have entire power to do as they please about the",
      "question. We profess that we, as citizens of a free State — as members of the confederation,",
      "through the general government have no power to disturb it where it is; and we profess",
      "that we have no more inclination than power to disturb it in those States; yet we",
      "are compelled to defend ourselves against the assumption that we are waring upon in the States. We insist that it shall be kept from the territories. Judge Douglas insists that",
      "we have no right to say anything about that; but I think that have some interest in",
      "that as white men. Do we not wish that our surplus population may have some outlet",
      "to go to? Do we not feel an interest, in going in to that outlet that such institutions",
      "shall prevail as are pleasing to us? and it is not the sort of thing that can be divided.",
      "If you go to a new territory opposed to slavery, and another man goes there with slaves,",
      "as equals, it turns out that he has it all his way, and you have no part in the matter.",
      "A few going into a territory with their slaves make it a slave territory, and consequently",
      "a slave State. Now, let me suggest this thing in another way. How may Democrats are here? A Voice— A thousand and one! (Laughter.) Mr.Lincoln—How many Democrats have professed to come into the State of Illinois, pretending that",
      "they desired to get rid of slavery? I guess that there are a thousand and one of",
      "that sort.(Applause:)Now, I will ask if your policy had prevailed in a time when this country had been",
      "in a state of existence similar to the territories to-day, where you would have gone",
      "to? And when hereafter, for any cause, the free people of these States shall desire",
      "to find new homes — an outlet — if they wish to be rid of the institution of slavery,",
      "where will they find the place to go to? Now, irrespective of the moral question",
      "— irrespective of the question as to whether there be right or wrong in enslaving",
      "the negro, I am still in favor of the new territory being kept free, into which free",
      "white men may move, fix their homes and better their conditions in life. I am in",
      "favor of that, — not merely — I must say it here as I say it elsewhere — not merely",
      "for our own people that are born among us, but I am in favor of an outlet for the",
      "free white people, for new homes in which all free white men from all the world may",
      "find place, and better their condition in life.(Applause.) I have stated upon former occasions, and I may as well do so again, what I understand",
      "to be the real issue in this controversy. There has been no issue between Judge Douglas and I on the point of my wanting to",
      "make war between the free and slave States. I may pass that. There has been no issue",
      "between Judge Douglas and I on the ground of my wanting to introduce a perfect social",
      "and political equality between the white and colored races. These are false issues",
      "that Judge Douglas has all the while tried to force this controversy upon without",
      "foundation. The real issue in this controversy, I think, springs from a sentiment",
      "in the mind, and that sentiment is this: on the one part it looks upon the institution",
      "of slavery as being wrong, and on the part of another class, it does not look upon",
      "it as wrong. The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery as being",
      "wrong, is the sentiment of the Republican party, it is the sentiment around which",
      "all their actions and all their arguments circle, from which all their propositions",
      "radiate. They look upon slavery as a moral, social, and political wrong, and while",
      "they contemplate it as being such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual",
      "existence among us, for the difficulties of getting rid of it in the States, and for",
      "all the constitutional obligations thrown around it; nevertheless, they do desire",
      "to see a policy instituted that looks to the thing not growing any larger; they insist",
      "upon a policy that shall treat it as a wrong, and as the mildest policy to that end,",
      "they look to the prevention of its growing larger, and to an end of it eventually.",
      "All their sentiments, arguments and propositions, are brought within this range.",
      "Now I have said, and I repeat it here, if there be any man among us who does not think",
      "that the institution of slavery is a wrong — that it is not a wrong in any one of",
      "the aspects in which I have spoken, he is misplaced, and ought not to be among us;",
      "and, if there by a man who is so impatient of it as a wrong, as to disregard the difficulties",
      "of getting rid of it, or as to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown around",
      "it, that man too is misplaced; we disclaim sympathy with him in political action;",
      "he is not placed properly with us. By the way, on this subject of treating it as a wrong, and limiting its spread, let",
      "me say a word. I have asked the question indirectly, what has ever threatened our",
      "own liberties and prosperity save and except this very institution of slavery? If",
      "this be true, how do you propose to amend it? By spreading it out larger, or making",
      "it bigger? You may have a cancer upon your person, and you may not be able to cut",
      "it out at once, lest you bleed to death, but you may not treat it as a wrong by spreading",
      "it over your whole body. So with this, the way is — it is the peaceful mode to deal",
      "with it — to prevent the spread of it into new country. That is the old fashioned",
      "way of dealing with it, the example of which our fathers have set us. On the other hand, I have said that there is a sentiment which treats it as not being",
      "a wrong. That is the Democratic sentiment of to-day. I do not mean to say that every",
      "man who stands within that range, positively asserts that it is right. That class",
      "will include all who do not say that it is right or wrong. This class all fall within",
      "the general class of those who do not look upon it as wrong; and now, if there be",
      "among you any one that supposes that he is a Democrat can consider and proclaim himself",
      "as being as much opposed to it as any body else. I would like to reason with him",
      "awhile. You never treat it as a wrong. What other thing that you consider wrong",
      "do you treat in that way? You, perhaps, say that it is wrong, but your leader does",
      "not say so, and you quarrel with every one else that says it is a wrong, although",
      "you say it yourself. We must not say anything about it in the free States, because",
      "it is not here; we must not anything about it in the slave States, because it is there;",
      "we must not say anything about it in policies, because it will disturb the quietness",
      "of my place; and you must not speak of it in the pulpit, because it is not religion.(Applause.)There is no suitable place to oppose it; but finally you say that if they would adopt",
      "systems of emancipation in the slave States, you would approve of it — but don’t deceive",
      "yourselves;Frank BlairandGratz Brownand their co-laborers tried that thing in Missouri that you pretend that you would",
      "like to see. Blair and Gratz Brown tried that thing and failed, and you threw up",
      "your hats and hurrahed for the democracy.(Applause.) More than that, take all the arguments that are made in favor of the system. Take,",
      "first, the system itself that you propose, and it carefully excludes the idea that",
      "there is anything wrong in the system of slavery; the arguments that sustain that",
      "policy carefully exclude it, and even here, to-day, you hear Judge Douglas quarrelling",
      "with me because I utter a wish that it might come some day to an end, although Mr.",
      "Clay can stand up and say that he wishes that every slave was in his own country,",
      "yet I am denounced as false to Henry Clay for expressing the wish that it may some",
      "time, in some way, come to an end. The Democratic policy in regard to that institution",
      "will not tolerate the merest breath expressive of the slightest opposition to it.",
      "Try it by some of Senator Douglas’ arguments. He says he don’t care whether it is",
      "voted up or down. Now, I don’t care whether that is intended to be expressive of",
      "his individual sentiment upon that subject, or whether it is intended to be expressive",
      "of the national policy that he desires should be carried out; it is alike valuable",
      "for my purposes. I say that a man can logically say that if he sees no wrong in it,",
      "but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong. No man can say",
      "that he does not care if a wrong is voted up or down, he cannot say that he is indifferent",
      "as to a wrong; but he must have a choice between the right or wrong. He says that",
      "whatever community desires slavery has a right to it. He can say so logically if",
      "it is not a wrong, but if he admits that it is wrong, he cannot logically say that",
      "anybody has a right to do wrong. He says upon the score of equality, slaves should",
      "be allowed to go into the territories the same as other property. His argument is",
      "logical if the properties are alike, but if one is wrong and the other right, then",
      "he cannot say that, for there is no equality between the right and the wrong. I say",
      "that everything in the Democratic policy, in the shape it takes in legislation, in",
      "the Dred Scott decision, in their conversations, every one carefully excludes the",
      "thought that there is any thing wrong in it whatever. That is the real issue! An issue that will continue in this country when these poor",
      "tongues of Douglas and myself shall be silent. These are the two principles that",
      "are made the eternal struggle between right and wrong, they are the two principles",
      "that have stood face to face, one of them asserting the divine right of kings, the",
      "same principle that says you work, you toil, you earn bread, and I will eat it. It",
      "is the same old serpent, whether it come from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride",
      "the people of his nation, and to live upon the fat of his neighbor, or, whether it",
      "comes from one race of men as an apology for the enslaving of another race of men.",
      "It is the same old policy, and I expressed my gratification that the judge at Quincy",
      "announced that he looks to no end of this controversy.(Considerable confusion here arising among the crowd — much difficulty was experienced",
      "in hearing.)Meanwhile, whenever that issue is clear, whenever we can get clear of those men that",
      "look to no end of it, when we can get those men out of that policy, and get them on",
      "the side of those who treat it as a wrong, there will soon be an end of it, it will",
      "then soon be in the course of ultimate extinction. When that issue can be made, and",
      "all extraneous matter can be removed between the combatants, they can settle the matter,",
      "and it will be done peacefully, too. There is no war about it. There is no violation",
      "of the constitution, no violation of right, or, of the necessities that spring from",
      "the actual presence of the thing. We need but that policy again, that places it where",
      "the wisest and best men of the world originally placed it. This manBrooks, of South Carolina, once declared that when this government was first established",
      "no one expected the institution of slavery to last until this day. When he said so,",
      "he stated a fact which I think is fully established by the history of the times; but,",
      "he said that though the men who framed this government were wiser and better men than",
      "the men of these days, that the men of these days had experience which their fathers",
      "had not, and that experience had brought them the invention of the cotton-gin which",
      "had made the perpetuation of the institution of slavery a necessity, I say that, willingly,",
      "or unwillingly, with purpose, or without purpose, Judge Douglas has been a most prominent",
      "instrument in the changing of the basis on which our fathers originally placed it,",
      "and putting it upon Brooks’ cottin-gin basis, placing it where he openly insists that he has no desire for the end of",
      "it. I understand that I have ten minutes yet, and I will employ that time, or a portion",
      "of it, with that argument that Judge Douglas uses, while he holds to the Dred Scott",
      "decision, that the people of a territory can some way or other decide that question",
      "for themselves. The first thing that I say on that point is, that he frequently said before that decision",
      "that it was a question for the courts, but now he virtually tells us that it is not",
      "a question for the church. But how does he state it? He says that it needs friendly",
      "legislation, and admits of unfriendly legislation, and that although he admits the",
      "right of the to take a slave into the territory, that with unfriendly legislation the people can",
      "really exclude it. I look to the constitutional authority, and I take the gentleman",
      "who looks me in the face. We will say he is a member of the territorial legislature;",
      "like Judge Douglas, he believes that the right to take and hold slaves there is a",
      "constitutional right. The first thing he does is to swear he will support the Constitution;",
      "and suppose his neighbor needs legislation that he may be enabled to enjoy that constitutional",
      "right, can he withhold that legislation which his neighbor needs for the enjoyment",
      "of a right which is fixed in his favor in the Constitution of the United States, which",
      "you remember he has sworn to support without violating his oath, I ask? And more",
      "especially can he pass unfriendly legislation without violating that oath? Why, this",
      "is a monstrous sort of talk about the Constitution of the United States! There never",
      "has been such outrageous talk — such lawless talk — about the Constitution of the",
      "United States, from any man of respectability, on the assumption, which he believes,",
      "that the right to hold slaves is a constitutional right. I don’t believe it is a",
      "constitutional right. I believe the decision is improperly made, and go for reversing",
      "it. Judge Douglas is furious in his speech on those who go for reversing it, yet",
      "he goes for legislating from it all its force, while he leaves it standing. I affirm",
      "here that there never has, from the mouth of a respectable man on earth, been uttered",
      "so monstrous a doctrine.(Applause.)Why, I suppose the most of us, I know I myself, believe, the people of the southern",
      "States are entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law; that that right is fixed",
      "in the Constitution; that it cannot be made available to them without congressional",
      "legislation; that it is, in the Judge’s language, a barren right, and that it needs",
      "legislation before it can be made efficient, and valuable to the persons to whom it",
      "is granted, and we, such as I, agree that that legislation should be maintained for",
      "them. On what ground? We profess not to like that legislation, and perhaps have",
      "no great taste for running after niggers. I profess to have none — and yet we do.",
      "At least, I yield my support to the fugitive slave law. Why? Because I do not understand",
      "that the Constitution which gives that right can be carried out if that legislation",
      "is withheld, and if I believed that the right to hold slaves in a territory was as",
      "firmly fixed as that is, why, on the same principle, I would be bound to give the",
      "legislation necessary to support it, and, I say, that no man can deny his obligation",
      "to give legislation for slave property in a territory, who believes that it is a constitutional",
      "right there. No man can make such an argument that will not give an Abolitionist",
      "a stronger argument to deny a fugitive slave law. Try it on and see; if that decision",
      "is correct, then that right of the slave power is as great a right as that of the",
      "slaveholder shall have his slave returned to him, and the man who argues that by unfriendly",
      "legislation, in spite of the constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the",
      "territory, furnishes the argument, and cannot avoid the argument upon which the Abolitionist",
      "may deny the obligation, and may claim the power to furnish unfriendly legislation",
      "against the right of the slaveholder to claim his slave. I don’t know how such a",
      "argument may take before a popular audience, but I defy any man to go before a court,",
      "or a class of men whose minds are accustomed to hearing arguments of this sort, and",
      "deny that there is a bit of difference between them. I defy any man to go before",
      "such a class of men — to go and make an argument for adopting unfriendly legislation",
      "in the territories, that will not give an argument against the constitutional right",
      "to a fugitive slave law. There is not such an abolitionist in all the States as Douglas. Mr. Lincoln being run down, stopped, having several minutes to spare. SENATOR DOUGLAS REPLY. Senator Douglas’ re-appearance in front of the stand was the signal for a general",
      "yell of applause, which fairly shook the earth and startled the old Mississippi which",
      "was rolling gently along in all its majesty with a few hundred yards of the stand. Senator Douglassaid Mr. Lincoln has concluded his remarks by saying that there is no such an Abolitionist",
      "as I am in all America. (Laughter.) If he could make the Abolitionists of Illinois",
      "believe that, he would not have much show for the Senate. (Great laughter and applause.)",
      "Let me make the Abolitionists believe the truth of that statement and his political",
      "back is broken. (Renewed laughter.) His first criticism upon me is the expression of his hope that the war of the administration",
      "will be prosecuted against me and the Democratic party of this State with vigor.",
      "He wants that war prosecuted with vigor; I have no doubt of it. His hopes of success,",
      "and the hopes of his party depend solely upon it. They have no chance of destroying",
      "the Democracy of this State except by the aid of federal patronage. (“That’s a fact,”",
      "“good,” and cheers.) He has all the federal office-holders here as his allies, (“That’s",
      "so,”) running separate tickets against the Democracy to divide the party, although",
      "the leaders all intend to vote directly the Abolition ticket, and only leave the green-horns",
      "to vote this separate ticket who refuse to do into the Abolition camp. (Laughter",
      "and cheers) There is something really refreshing in the thought that Mr. Lincoln is",
      "in favor of prosecuting one war vigorously. (Roars of laughter.) It is the first",
      "war I ever knew him to be in favor of prosecuting. (Renewed laughter.) It is the",
      "first war that I ever knew him to believe to be just or constitutional. (Laughter",
      "and cheers.) when theMexican warbeing waged, and the American army was surrounded by the enemy inMexico, he thought that war was unconstitutional, unnecessary and unjust.—(“That’s so” “you’ve",
      "got him,” “he voted against it,” &c.) He thought it was not commenced on the rightspot. (Laughter.) When I made an incidental allusion of that kind in the joint discussion over at Charleston",
      "some weeks ago, Lincoln, in replying, said that I, Douglas, had charged him with voting",
      "against supplies for the Mexican war, and then he reared up, full length, and swore",
      "that he never voted against the supplies—that it was a slander—and caught hold ofFicklin, who sat on the stand, and said, “Here, Ficklin, tell the people that it is a lie.”",
      "(Laughter and cheers.) Well, Ficklin, who had served in Congress with him, stood up",
      "and told them all that he recollected about it. It was that whenGeorge Ashmun, ofMassachusetts, brought forward a resolution declaring the war unconstitutional, unnecessary, and",
      "unjust, that Lincoln had voted for it. “Yes,” said Lincoln, “I did.” Thus confessed",
      "that he voted that the war was wrong, that our country was in the wrong, and consequently",
      "that the Mexicans were in the right; but charged that I had slander him by saying",
      "that he voted against the supplies. I never charged him with voting against the supplies",
      "in my life, because I knew that he was not in Congress when they were voted. (Tremendous",
      "shouts of laughter.) The war was commenced on the 13th day of May, 1846, and on that",
      "day we appropriated in Congress ten millions of dollars and fifty thousand men to",
      "prosecute it. During the same session we voted more men and more money, and at the",
      "next session we voted more men and more money, so that by the time Mr. Lincoln entered",
      "Congress we had enough men and enough money to carry on the war, and had no occasion",
      "to vote any more. (Laughter and cheers.) When he got into the House, being opposed",
      "to the war, and not being able to stop the supplies, because they had all gone forward,",
      "all he could do was to follow the lead ofCorwin, and prove that the war was not begun on the right spot, and that it was unconstitutional,",
      "unnecessary, and wrong. Remember, too, that this he did after the war had been begun.",
      "It is one thing to be opposed to the declaration of a war, another and very different",
      "thing to take sides with the enemy against your own country after the war has been",
      "commenced. (“Good.” and cheers.) Our army was in Mexico at the time, many battles",
      "had been fought; our citizens, who were defending the honor of their country’s flag,",
      "were surrounded by the daggers, the guns and the poison of the enemy. Then it was",
      "that Corwin made his speech in which he declared that the American soldiers ought",
      "to be welcomed by the Mexicans with bloody hands and hospitable graves; then it was",
      "that Ashmun and Lincoln voted in the House of Representatives that the war was unconstitutional",
      "and unjust; and Ashmun’s resolution, Corwin’s speech, and Lincoln’s vote were sent",
      "to Mexico and read at the head of the Mexican army, to prove to them that there was",
      "a Mexican party in the Congress of the United States who were doing all in their power",
      "to aid them. (“That’s the truth,” “Lincoln’s a traitor,” etc.) That a man who takes sides with the common enemy against his own country in time",
      "of war should rejoice in a war being made on me now, is very natural. (Immense applause.)",
      "And in my opinion, no other kind of a man would rejoice in it. (”That’s true,” “hurrah",
      "for Douglas.” and cheers.) Mr. Lincoln has told you a great deal to-day about his being an old line Clay Whig.",
      "(“He never was.”) Bear in mind that there are a great many old Clay Whigs down in",
      "this region. It is more agreeable, therefore, for him o talk about the old Clay Whig party than it is for him to talk Abolitionism. We did",
      "not hear much about the old Clay Whig party up in the Abolition districts. How much",
      "of an old line Henry Clay Whig was he? Have you readGen. Singleton’s speech atJacksonville? (Yes, yes, and cheers.) You know that Gen. Singleton was, for twenty-five years,",
      "the confidential friend of Henry Clay in Illinois, and he testified that in 1847,",
      "when the constitutional convention of this State was in session, the Whigs members",
      "were invited to a Whig caucus at the house of Mr. Lincoln’sbrother-in-law, where Mr. Lincoln proposed to throw Henry Clay overboard and take upGen. Taylorin his place, giving, as his reason, that if the Whigs did not take up Gen. Taylor",
      "the Democrats would. (Cheers and laughter.) Singleton testifies that Lincoln, in",
      "that speech, urged, as another reason for throwing Henry Clay overboard, that the",
      "Whigs had fought long enough for principle and ought to begin to fight for success.",
      "Singleton also testifies that Lincoln’s speech did have the effect of cutting Clay’s",
      "throat, and that he, Singleton, and others withdrew from the caucus in indignation.",
      "He further states that when they got toPhiladelphiato attend thenational conventionof the Whig party, that Lincoln was there, the bitter and deadly enemy of Clay, and",
      "that he tried to keep him (Singleton) out of the convention because he insisted on",
      "voting for Clay, and Lincoln was determined to have Taylor. (Laughter and applause.)",
      "Singleton says that Lincoln rejoiced with very great joy when he found the mangled",
      "remains of the murdered Whig statesman lying cold before him. Now, Mr. Lincoln tells",
      "you that he is an old line Clay Whig! (Laughter and cheers.) Gen. Singleton testifies",
      "to the facts I have narrated in a public speech which has been printed and circulated",
      "broadcast over the States for weeks, yet not a lisp have we heard from Mr. Lincoln",
      "on the subject, except that he is an old Clay Whig. What part of Henry Clay’s policy did Lincoln ever advocate? He was in Congress in",
      "1848-9 when theWilmot provisowarfare disturbed the peace and harmony of the country until it shook the foundation",
      "of the republic from its centre to its circumference. It was that agitation that brought Clay forth from his retirement",
      "at Ashland again to occupy his seat in the Senate of the United States, to see if",
      "he could not, by his great wisdom and experience, and the renown of his name, do something",
      "to restore peace and quiet to a disturbed country. Who got up that sectional strife",
      "that Clay had to be called upon to quell? I have heard Lincoln boast that he voted forty-two times for the Wilmot",
      "proviso, and that he would have voted as many times more if he could. (Laughter.)",
      "Lincoln is the man, in connection withSeward, Chase, Giddings, and other Abolitionists, who got up that strife that I helped Clay",
      "to put down. (Tremendous applause.) Henry Clay came back to the Senate in 1849, and",
      "say that he must do something to restore peace to the country. The Union Whigs and",
      "the Union Democrats welcomed him the moment he arrived, as the man for the occasion.",
      "We believed that he, of all men on earth, had been preserved by Divine Providence",
      "to guide us out of our difficulties, and we Democrats rallied under Clay then, as",
      "you Whigs in nullification time rallied under the banner of oldJackson, forgetting party when the country was in danger, in order that we might have a country",
      "first, and parties afterwards. (“Three cheers for Douglas.”) And this reminds me that Mr. Lincoln told you that the slavery question was the only",
      "thing that ever disturbed the peace and harmony of the Union. Did not nullification",
      "once raise its head and disturb the peace of this Union in 1832? Was that the slavery",
      "question, Mr. Lincoln? Did not disunion raise its monster head during thelast war with Great Britain? Was that the slavery question, Mr. Lincoln? The peace of this country has been",
      "disturbed three times, once during the war withGreat Britain, once on the tariff question, and once on the slavery question. (\"Three cheers for",
      "Douglas\") His argument, therefore, that slavery is the only question that has ever",
      "created dissension in the Union falls to the ground. It is true that agitators are",
      "enabled now to use this slavery question for the purpose of sectional strife. (“That’s",
      "so.”) He admits that in regard to all things else, the principle that I advocate,",
      "making each State and territory free to decide for itself ought to prevail. He instances",
      "cranberry laws, and the oyster laws, and he might have gone though the whole list with the same effect. I say that all these laws are local and domestic,",
      "and that local and domestic concerns should be left to each State and each territory",
      "to manage for itself. If agitators would acquiesce in that principle, there never",
      "would be any danger to the peace and harmony of this Union. (“That’s so,” and cheers.) Mr. Lincoln tries to avoid the main issues by attacking the truth of my proposition,",
      "that our fathers made this government divided into free and slave States, recognizing",
      "that the right of each to decide all its local questions for itself. Did they not",
      "thus make it? It is true that they did not establish slavery in any of the States,",
      "or abolish it in any of them; but finding thirteen States twelve of which were slave",
      "and one free, they agreed to form a government uniting them together, as they stoo divided into free and slave States, and to guarantee forever to each State the right",
      "to do as it pleased on the slavery question. (Cheers.) Having thus made the government,",
      "and conferred this right upon each State forever, I assert that this government can",
      "exist as they made it, divided into free and slave States, if any one State chooses",
      "to retain slavery. (Cheers.) He says that he looks forward to a time when slavery",
      "shall be abolished everywhere. I look forward to a time when each State shall be",
      "allowed to do as it pleases. If it chooses to keep slavery forever, it is not my",
      "business, but its own; if it chooses to abolish slavery, it is its own business—not",
      "mine. I care more for the great principle of self-government, the right of the people",
      "to rule, that I do for all the negroes in Christendom. (Cheers.) I would not endanger",
      "the perpetuity of this Union. I would not blot out the great inalienable rights of",
      "the white men for all the negroes that ever existed. (Renewed applause.) Hence, I",
      "say, let us maintain this government on the principles that our fathers made it, recognizing",
      "the right of each State to keep slavery as long as it people determine, or to abolish",
      "it when they please. (Cheers.) But Mr. Lincoln says that when our fathers made this",
      "government they did not look forward to the state of things now existing; and therefore",
      "he thinks the doctrine was wrong; and he quotes Brooks, of South Carolina, to prove",
      "that our fathers then thought that probably slavery would be abolished, by each State",
      "acting for itself before this time. Suppose they did; suppose they did not foresee",
      "what has occurred,—does that change the principles of our government? They did not",
      "probably foresee the telegraph that transmits intelligence by lightning, nor did they",
      "foresee the railroads that now form the bonds of union between the different States,",
      "or the thousand mechanical inventions that have elevated mankind. But do these things",
      "change the principles of the government? Our fathers, I say, made this government",
      "on the principle of the right of each State to do as it pleases in its own domestic",
      "affairs, subject to the constitution, and allowed the people of each to apply to every",
      "new change of circumstance such remedy as they may see fit to improve their condition.",
      "This right they have for all time to come. (Cheers.) Mr. Lincoln went on to tell you that he does not at all de ire to interfere with slavery in the States where it exists, nor does his party. I expected",
      "him to say that down here. (Laughter.) Let me ask him then how he is going to put",
      "slavery in the course of ultimate extinction everywhere, if he does not intend to",
      "interfere with it in the States where it exists? (Renewed laughter.) He says that",
      "he will prohibit it in all territories, and the inference is then that unless they",
      "make free States out of them he will keep them out of the Union; for, mark you, he",
      "did not say whether or not he would vote to admit Kansas with slavery or not, as her",
      "people might apply; (he forgot that as usual, &c;) he did not say whether or not he was in favor of bringing the territories now in",
      "existence into the Union on the principle of Clay’s compromise measures on the slavery",
      "question. I told you that he would not. (Give it to him, he deserves it, &c.) His idea is that he will prohibit slavery in all the territories, and thus force",
      "them all to become free States, surrounding the slave States with a cordon of free",
      "States, and hemming them in, keeping the slaves confined to their present limits whilst",
      "they go on multiplying until the soil on which they live will no longer feed them,",
      "and he will thus be able to put slavery in the course of ultimate extinction by starvation.",
      "(Cheers.) He will extinguish slavery in the Southern States as the French general",
      "exterminated the Algerines when he smoked them out. He is going to extinguish slavery",
      "by surrounding the slave States, hemming in the slaves, and starving them out of existence",
      "as you smoke a fix out of his hole. And he intends to do that in the name of humanity",
      "and Christianity, in order that we may get rid of the terrible crime and sin entailed",
      "upon our fathers of holding slaves. (Laughter and cheers). Mr. Lincoln makes out",
      "that line of policy, and appeals to the moral sense of justice, and to the Christian",
      "feeling of the community to sustain him. He says that any man who holds to the contrary",
      "doctrine is in the position of the king who claimed to govern by divine right. Let",
      "us examine for a moment and see what principle it was that overthrew the divine right",
      "ofGeorge the Thirdto govern us. Did not these colonies rebel because theBritish parliamenthad no right to pass laws concerning our property and domestic and private institutions",
      "without our consent? We demanded that the British government should not pass such",
      "laws unless they gave us representation in the body passing them,—and this the British",
      "government insisting on doing,—we went towar, on the principle that the home government should not control and govern distant",
      "colonies without giving them a representation. Now, Mr. Lincoln proposes to govern",
      "the territories without giving the people a representation, and calls on Congress",
      "to pass laws controlling their property and domestic concerns without their consent",
      "and against their will. Thus, he asserts for his party the identical principle asserted",
      "by George III and the tories of theRevolution. (Cheers.) I ask you to look into these things, and then to tell me whether the democracy or",
      "the abolitionists are right. I hold that the people of a territory, like those of",
      "a States, (I use the language of Mr. Buchanan in his letter of acceptance,) have the",
      "right to decide for themselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their",
      "limits. (“That’s the idea,” “Hurrah for Douglas.”) They point upon which Chief Justice",
      "Taney expresses his opinion is simply this, that slaves being property, stand on an",
      "equal footing with other property, and consequently that the owner has the same right",
      "to carry that property into a territory that he has any other, subject to the same",
      "conditions. Suppose that one of your merchants was to take fifty or one hundred thousand",
      "dollars worth of liquors to Kansas. He has a right to go there under that decision,",
      "but when he gets there he finds the Maine liquor law in force, and what can he do",
      "with his property after he gets it there? He cannot sell it, he cannot use it, it",
      "is subject to the local law, and that law is against him, and the best thing he can",
      "do with it is to bring it back into Missouri or Illinois and sell it. If you take",
      "negroes to Kansas, as Col. Jeff. Davis said in his Bangor speech, from which I have quoted to-day, you must take them",
      "there subject to local law. If the people want the institution of slavery they will",
      "protect and encourage it; but if they do not want it they will withhold that protection,",
      "and the absence of local legislation protecting slavery excludes it as completely",
      "as a positive prohibition. (“That’s so, and cheers.) You slaveholders of Missouri",
      "might as well understand what you know practically, that you cannot carry slavery",
      "where the people do not want it. (“That’s so.”) All you have a right to ask is that",
      "the people shall do as they please; if they want slavery let them have it; if they",
      "do not want it, allow them to refuse to encourage it. My friends, if, as I have said before, we will only live up to this great fundamental",
      "principle there will be peace between the North and the South. Mr. Lincoln admits t at under the constitution on all domestic questions, except slavery, we ought not to",
      "interfere with the people of each State. What right have we to interfere with slavery",
      "any more than we have to interfere with any other question. He says that this slavery",
      "question is now the bone of contention. Why? Simply because agitators have combined",
      "in all the free States to make war upon it. Suppose the agitators in the States should",
      "combine in one-half of the Union to make war upon the railroad system of the other",
      "half? They would thus be driven to the same sectional strife. Suppose one section",
      "makes war upon any other peculiar institution of the opposite section, and the same",
      "strife is produced. They only remedy and safety is that we shall stand by the constitution",
      "as our fathers made it, obey the laws, as they are passed, while they stand the proper",
      "test and sustain the decisions of the Supreme Court and the constituted authorities. Senator Douglas’ half hour here expired. For some minutes after he concluded, the",
      "applause was perfectly deafening and overwhelming. He seemed to have carried his",
      "vast auditory entirely with him, in sympathy and feeling, for their enthusiasm was"

        "text": "Ladies and Gentlemen: It is not nearly four months since thecanvassbetween Mr. Lincoln and myself commenced.  On the 16th of June theRepublican Conventionassembled atSpringfieldand nominated Mr. Lincoln as their candidate for theU.S. Senate, and he, on that occasion, delivered a speech in which he laid down what he understood\n               to be theRepublicancreed and the platform on which he proposed to stand during the contest.  The principal\n               points in that speech of Mr. Lincoln’s were: first, that this government could not\n               endure permanently divided into free and slave States, as our fathers made it; that\n               they must all become free or all become slave; all become one thing or all become\n               the other, otherwise the Union could not continue to exist.  I give you his opinions\n               almost in the identical language he used.  His second proposition was a crusade against\n               theSupreme Court of the United Statesbecause of theDred Scott decision; urging as an especial reason for his opposition to that decision that it deprived\n               the negroes of the rights and benefits of that clause in the Constitution of the United\n               States which guarantees to the citizens of each States, all the rights, privileges,\n               and immunities of the citizens of the several States.  On the 1oth of July I returned\n               home, and delivered a speech to the people ofChicago, in which I announced it to be my purpose to appeal to the people ofIllinoisto sustain the course I had pursued inCongress. In that speech I joined issue with Mr. Lincoln on the points which he had presented.\n               Thus there was an issue clear and distinct made up between us on these two propositions\n               laid down in the speech of Mr. Lincoln at Springfield, and controverted by me in my\n               reply to him at Chicago.  On the next day, the 11th of July, Mr. Lincoln replied to\n               me at Chicago, explaining at some length, and re-affirming the positions which he\n               had taken in his Springfield speech.  In that Chicago speech he even went further\n               than he had before, and uttered sentiments in regard to the negro being on an equality\n               with the white man.  (That’s so.) He adopted in support of this position the argument\n               whichLovejoyandCodding, and otherAbolitionlecturers had made familiar in the northern and central portions of theState, to wit: that the Declaration of Independence having  declared all men free and equal,\n               by Divine law, also that negro equality was an inalienable right, of which they could\n               not be deprived.  He insisted, in that speech, that the Declaration of Independence\n               included the negro in the clause asserting that all men were created equal, and went\n               so far as to say that if one man was allowed to take the position, that it did not\n               include the negro, others might take the position that it did not include other men.\n               He said that all these distinctions between this man and that man, this race and the\n               other race, must be discarded, and we must all stand by the Declaration of Independence,\n               declaring that all men were created equal."

        "text": "The issue thus being made up between Mr. Lincoln and myself on three points, we went\n               before the people of the State.  During the following seven weeks, between the Chicago\n               speeches and our first meeting atOttawa, he and I addressed large assemblages of the people in many of the central counties.\n               In my speeches I confined myself closely to those three positions which he had taken\n               controverting his proposition that this Union could not exist as our fathers made\n               it, divided into free and slave States, controverting his proposition of a crusade\n               against the Supreme Court because of the Dred Scott decision, and controverting his\n               proposition that the Declaration of Independence included and meant the negroes as\n               well as the white men, when it declared all men to be created equal.  (Cheers for\n               Douglas). I supposed at that time that these propositions constituted a distinct issue\n               between us, and that the opposite positions we had taken upon them we would be willing\n               to be held to in every part of the State.  I never intended to waver one hair’s breadth\n               from that issue either in the north or the south, or wherever I should address the\n               people of Illinois.  I hold that when the time arrives that I cannot proclaim my political\n               creed in the same terms not only in the northern but the southern part of Illinois,\n               not only in the northern but the southern States, and wherever the American flag waves\n               over American soil, that then there must be something wrong in that creed.  (“Good,\n               good,” and cheers.) So long as we live under a common constitution, so long as we\n               live in a confederacy of sovereign and equal States, joined together as one for certain\n               purposes, that any political creed is radically wrong which cannot be proclaimed in\n               every State, and every section of that Union alike.  I took up Mr. Lincoln’s three\n               propositions in my several speeches, analyzed them, and pointed out what I believed\n               to be the radical errors contained in them. First, in regard to his doctrine that\n               this government was in violation of the law of God which say, that a house divided\n               against itself cannot stand, I repudiated it as a slander upon the immortal framers\n               of our constitution.  I then said, have often repeated, and now again assert, that\n               in my opinion this government can endure forever, (good,) divided into free and slave\n               States as our fathers made it,—each State having the right to prohibit, abolish, or\n               sustain slavery just as it pleases. (“Good,” “right,” and cheers.) This government\n               was made upon the great basis of the sovereignty of the States, the right of each\n               State to regulate its own domestic institutions to suit itself, and that right was\n               conferred with understanding and expectation that inasmuch as each locality had separate\n               interests, each locality must have different and distinct local and domestic institutions,\n               corresponding to its wants and interests.  Our fathers knew when they made the government,\n               that the laws and institutions which were well adapted to the green mountains ofVermont, were unsuited to the rice plantations ofSouth Carolina.  They knew then, as well as we know now, that the laws and institutions which would\n               be well adapted to the beautiful prairies of Illinois would not be suited to the mining\n               regions ofCalifornia.  They knew that in a Republic as broad as this, having such a variety of soil, climate\n               and interest, there must necessarily be a corresponding variety of local laws—the\n               policy and institutions of each State adapted to its condition and wants.  For this\n               reason this Union was established on the right of each State to do as it pleased on\n               the question of slavery, and every other question; and the various States were not\n               allowed to complain of, much less interfere, with the policy of their neighbors. \n               (“That’s good doctrine,” “that’s the doctrine,” and cheers.)"

Imagine\n               for a moment that Mr. Lincoln had been a member of the convention that framed the\n               Constitution of the United States, and that when its members were about to sign that\n               wonderful document, he had arisen in that convention as he did at Springfield this\n               summer, and addressing himself to the President, had said “a house divided against\n               itself cannot stand; (laughter,) this government divided into free and slave States\n               cannot endure, they must all be free or all be slave, they must all be one thing or\n               all be the other, otherwise, it is a violation of the law of God, and cannot continue\n               to exist;”—supposed Mr. Lincoln had convinced that body of sages, that that doctrine\n               was sound, what would have been the result?  Remember that the Union was then composed\n               of thirteen States, twelve of which were slaveholding andonefree.  Do you think that the one free State would have outvoted the twelve slaveholding\n               States, and thus have secured the abolition of slavery?—(No, no.) On the other hand,\n               would not the twelve slaveholding States have outvoted the one free State, and thus\n               have fastened slavery, by a Constitutional provision, on every foot of the American\n               Republic forever?  You see that if this abolition doctrine of Mr. Lincoln had prevailed\n               when the government was made it would have established slavery as a permanent institution,\n               in all the States whether they wanted it or not, and the question for us to determine\n               is Illinois now as one of the free States is, whether or not we are willing, having\n               become the majority section, to enforce a doctrine on the minority, which we would\n               have resisted with our heart’s blood had it been attempted on us when we were in a\n               minority.  (“We never will,” good, good, and cheers.) How has the South lost her power\n               as the majority section in this Union, and how have the free States gained it, except\n               under the operation of that principle which declares the right of people of each State\n               and each territory to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way.\n               It was under that principle that slavery was abolished inNew Hampshire,Rhode Island,Connecticut,New York,New Jersey, andPennsylvania; it was under that principle that one half of the slaveholding States became free;\n               it was under that principle that the number of free States increased until from being\n               one out of twelve States, we have grown to be the majority of States of the whole\n               Union, with the power to control theHouse of Representativesand Senate, and the power, consequently, to elect as President by Northern votes\n               without the aid of a Southern State.  Having obtained this power under the operation\n               of that great principle, are you now prepared to abandon the principle and declare\n               that merely because we have the power you will wage a war against the Southern States\n               and their institutions until you force them to abolish slavery everywhere.

He would not\n               answer; but in a round about way said that if slavery should be kept out of a territory\n               during the whole of its territorial existence, and then the people, when they adopted\n               a State constitution, asked admission as a slave State, he supposed he would have\n               to let the State come in.  The case I put to him was an entirely different one.  I\n               desired to know whether he would vote to admit a State if Congress had not prohibited\n               slavery in it during its territorial existence, as Congress never pretended to do\n               underClay’scompromise measures of 1850.

I have asked Mr. Lincoln three times in our joint discussions whether\n               he would vote to redeem that pledge, and he has never yet answered.  He is as silent\n               as the grave on the subject.

(“He’ll never have to act on any question,” and laughter.)\n               Why can he not say whether he is willing to allow the people of each State to have\n               slavery or not as they please, and to come into the Union when they have the requisite\n               population as a slave or a free State as they decide?  I have no trouble in answering\n               the question.  I have said everywhere, and now repeat it to you, that if the people\n               of Kansas want a slave State they have a right, under the constitution of the United\n               States, to form such a State, and I will let them come into the Union with slavery\n               or without, as they determine.  (“That’s right,” “good,” “hurrah for Douglas all the\n               time,” and cheers.) If the people of any other territory desire slavery let them have\n               it.  If they do not want it let them prohibit it.  It is their business not mine.\n               (“That’s it exactly,” “that’s so,” hurrah, &c.) It is none of our business in Illinois whetherKansasis a free State or a slave State.

ADemocratic Administrationwhich we helped to bring to power, deems it consistent with its fidelity to principle\n               and its regard to duty, to wield its power in this State in behalf of the Republican\n               abolition candidates in every county and every Congressional district against the\n               Democratic party.  All I have to say in reference to the matter is, that if that administration\n               have not regard enough for principle, if they are not sufficiently attached to the\n               creed of the Democratic party to bury forever their personal hostilities in order\n               to succeeed in carrying out our glorious principles, I have. (Good, good, and cheers.) I have\n               no personal difficulties with Mr.Buchananor his cabinet.  He chose to make certain recommendations to Congress as he had a\n               right to do on the Lecompton question.  I could not vote in favor of them.  I had\n               as much right to judge for myself how I should vote as he had how he should recommend.\n               He undertook to say to me,  if you do not vote as I tell you, I will take off the\n               heads of your friends.  (Laughter.) I replied to him, “you did not elect me, I represent\n               Illinois and I am accountable to Illinois, as my constituency, and to God, but not\n               to the President or to any other power on earth.

In\n               matters of legislation the President has a veto on the action of the Senate, and in\n               appointments and treaties the Senate has a veto on the President.

        "text": "My friends, there never was a time when it was as important for the Democratic party,\n               for all national men, to rally and stand together as it is to-day.  We find all sectional men giving up past differences and continuing the one question\n               of slavery, and when we find sectional men thus uniting, we should unite to resist\n               them and their treasonable designs.  Such was the case in 1850, when Clay left the\n               quiet and peace of his home, and again entered upon public life to quell agitation\n               and restore peace to a distracted Union.  Then we Democrats, withCassat our head, welcomedHenry Clay, whom the whole nation regarded as having been preserved by God for the times.  He\n               became our leader in that great fight, and we rallied around him the same as the Whigs\n               rallied aroundold Hickoryin 1832, to put down nullification.  (Cheers.) Thus you see that whilst Whigs and\n               Democrats fought fearlessly in old times about banks, the tariffs, distribution, the\n               specie circular, and the sub treasury, all united as a band of brothers when the peace,\n               harmony, or integrity of the Union was imperiled.  (Tremendous applause.) It was so\n               in 1850, when abolitionism had even so far divided this country, North and South,\n               as to endanger the peace of the Union; Whigs and Democrats united in establishing\n               thecompromise measuresof that year, and restoring tranquillity and good feeling.  These measures passed\n               on the joint action of th two parties.  They rested on the great principle that the\n               people of each State and each territory should be left perfectly free to form and\n               regulate their domestic institutions to suit themselves.  You Whigs and we Democrats\n               justified them in that principle.  In 1854, when it became necessary to organize the\n               territories of Kansas and Nebraska, I brought forward the bill on the same principle.\n               In theKansas-Nebraska billyou find it declared to be the true intent and meaning of the act not to legislate\n               slavery into any State or territory, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the\n               people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in\n               their own way.  (“That’s so” and cheers.) I stand on that same platform in 1858 that\n               I did in 1850, 1854, and 1856.  TheWashingtonUnion, pretending to be the organ of the Administration, in the number of the 5th of this\n               month, devotes three columns and a half to establish these propositions: First, that\n               Douglas, in his Freeport speech, held the same doctrine that he did in hisNebraska billin 1854; second, that in 1854 Douglas justified the Nebraska bill upon the ground\n               that it was based upon the same principle as Clay’s compromise measures of 1850. \n               TheUnionthus proved that Douglas was the same in 1858 that he was in 1856, 1854, and 1850,\n               and consequently argued that he was never a Democrat.   (Great laughter.) Is it not\n               funny that I was never a Democrat? (Renewed laughter.) There is no pretense that I\n               have changed a hair’s breath.  TheUnionproves by my speeches that I explained the compromise measures of 1850 just as I\n               do now, and that I explained the Kansas and Nebraska bill in 1854 just as I did in\n               my Freeport speech, and yet says that I am not a Democrat, and cannot be trusted,\n               because I have not changed during the whole of that time.  It has occurred to me that\n               in 1854 theauthorof the Kansas and Nebraska bill was considered a pretty good Democrat. (Cheers.)\n               It has occurred to me that in 1856, when I was exerting every nerve and every energy\n               for James Buchanan, standing on the same platform then that I do now, that I was a\n               pretty good Democrat.  (Renewed applause.) They now tell me that I am not a Democrat,\n               because I assert that the people of a territory, as well as those of a State, have\n               the right to decide for themselves whether slavery can or can not exist in such territory.\n               Let me read what James Buchanan said on that point when he accepted the Democraticnomination for the presidency in 1856.  In his letter of acceptance, he used the following language:"

Orr, construed the Kansas and Nebraska bill in this same way in 1856, and also that great\n               intellect of the South,Alex. H. Stephens, put the same construction upon it in Congress that I did in my Freeport speech.\n               The whole South are rallying to support the doctrine that if the people of a Territory\n               want slavery they have a right to have it, and if they do not want it that no power\n               on earth can force it upon them.

I hold that the signers of the Declaration\n               of Independence had no reference to negroes at all when they declared all men to be\n               created equal.  They did not mean negro, nor the savage Indians, nor the Fejee Islanders,\n               nor any other barbarous race.  They were speaking of white men.  (“It’s so,” “it’s\n               so,” and cheers.) They alluded to men of European birth and European descent—to white\n               men, and to none others, when they declared that doctrine.  (“That’s the truth.”)\n               I hold that this government was established on the white basis.  It was established\n               by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever, and should\n               be administered by white men, and none others.  But it does not follow, by any means,\n               that merely because the negro is not a citizen, and merely because he is not our equal,\n               that, therefor, he should be a slave.  On the contrary, it does follow, that we ought to extend\n               to the negro race, and to all other dependent races all the rights, all the privileges,\n               and all the immunities which they can exercise consistently with the safety of society.\n               Humanity requires that we should give them all these privileges; christianity commands\n               that we should extend those privileges to them.  The question then arises what are\n               those privileges, and what is the nature and extent of them.  My answer is that that\n               is a question which each State must answer for itself.  We in Illinois have decided\n               it for ourselves.  We tried slavery, kept it up for twelve years, and finding that\n               it was not profitable we abolished it for that reason, and became a free State.  We\n               adopted in its stead the policy that a negro in this State shall not be a slave and\n               shall not be a citizen.  We have a right to adopt that policy.  For my party I think\n               it is a wise and sound policy for us.  You in Missouri must judge for yourselves whether\n               it is a wise policy for you.  If you choose to follow our example, very good; if you\n               reject it, still well, it is your business, not ours.  So withKentucky.  Let Kentucky adopt a policy to suit herself.  If we do not like it we will keep\n               away from it, and if she does not like ours let her stay at home, mind her own business\n               and let us alone.  If the people of all the States will act on that great principle,\n               and each State mind its own business, attend to its own affairs, take care of its\n               own negroes and not meddle with its neighbors, then there will be peace between the\n               North and the South, the East and the West, throughout the whole Union. (Cheers.)\n               Why can we not thus have peace?  Why should we thus allow a sectional party to agitate\n               this country, to array the North against the South, and convert us into enemies instead\n               of friend, merely that, a few ambitious men may ride into power on a sectional hobby?\n               How long is it since these ambitious Northern men wished  for a sectional organization?\n               Did any one of them dream of a sectional party as long as the North was the weaker\n               section and the South the stronger?  Then all were opposed to sectional parties; but\n               the moment the North obtained the majority in the House and Senate by the admission\n               of California, and could elect a President without the aid of Southern votes, that\n               moment ambitious Northern men formed a scheme to excite the North against the South,\n               and make the people be governed in their votes by geographical lines, thinking that\n               the North, being the stronger section, would outvote the South, and consequently they,\n               the leaders, would ride into office on a sectional hobby.

I have heard the Judge two or three times state what\n                  he stated to-day — that in a speech which I had made at Springfield, Illinois, I had\n                  in a very special manner complained that the Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott decision,\n                  had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States.  I have omitted\n                  heretofore by some-sort of accident to notice that statement of the Judge.  It has\n                  recurred to my memory to notice it now.  In point of fact it is untrue as the Judge\n                  stated it.  I never have complained of the Dred Scott decision because it decided\n                  that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States.  I have the speech here,\n                  and I will thank him or any of his friends to find where I specially complained of\n                  the decision because it decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United\n                  States.  I have done no such thing!  Judge Douglas’ persistency in insisting that\n                  I have done so, has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on\n                  his part of misrepresent me.  He could not get his foundation for insisting that I\n                  was in favor of negro equality anywhere else so well as in assuming that in regard\n                  to me."

I pointed out in that\n                  speech what points had been decided in that decision by the court.  I mentioned that\n                  they had decided that a negro could not be a citizen, as a fact, and I mentioned that\n                  they had done so, as I supposed, to deprive the negro of all power of ever becoming\n                  a citizen, and claiming the rights of a citizen of the United States under a certain\n                  clause of the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to the citizens\n                  of each State all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.\n                  I stated that, without making any complaint of it at all.  I adduced what other points\n                  they had decided, that the bringing of a slave in the State of Illinois, and holding\n                  him for two years, was a matter that they would not decide as to whether it would\n                  make him free or not; that they decided that taking him into a territory of the United\n                  States, where an act of Congress had made it free, did not make him free because the\n                  act was unconstitutional.  I mentioned all these in a lump, and taken in connection\n                  with the Nebraska bill and the amendment ofChase, explanatory of the pretended objects of the bill, offered at the time, which was\n                  voted down by the friends of the bill, and combing these things together and offering\n                  them, I argued that they tended to prove a combination or conspiracy, tending to make\n                  the institution of slavery national in the United States."

I said that we were “now far into the fifth year\n                  since a policy was instituted for the avowed object, and with the confident promise,\n                  of putting an end to slavery agitation.” Is not that so? When did the Nebraska bill\n                  come forward?  Four years ago the fourth day of January last, and we are far into\n                  the fifth year since then.  Was not the avowed object of that bill to put an end to\n                  slavery agitation?  We were to have no more agitation of the slavery question in Congress,\n                  no more in the States, and it was all to be confined to the territories.  But here\n                  I will remark, as Judge Douglas is very fond of complimenting Mr.Crittendenabout this time, that he said that there was a falsehood in it, that there was no\n                  slavery agitation at the time the bill was introduced, and that the bill was itself\n                  the means of stirring it up again.(Applause.)But was it not introduced with the purpose and confident promise of putting an end\n                  to slavery agitation? Why, every speech that he (Douglas) made until he got into theimbroglio, I believe you call it, with the administration, was to the effect that it was the\n                  purpose of that bill to put an end to the agitation of the question of slavery — that\n                  the last kink of its tail was just drawing out of sight.  I have said that “under\n                  the operation of that policy, that agitation has only not ceased, but has constantly\n                  augmented.”  Is not that true?

There has been no issue\n                  between Judge Douglas and I on the ground of my wanting to introduce a perfect social\n                  and political equality between the white and colored races.  These are false issues\n                  that Judge Douglas has all the while tried to force this controversy upon without\n                  foundation.  The real issue in this controversy, I think, springs from a sentiment\n                  in the mind, and that sentiment is this: on the one part it looks upon the institution\n                  of slavery as being wrong, and on the part of another class, it does not look upon\n                  it as wrong.  The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery as being\n                  wrong, is the sentiment of the Republican party, it is the sentiment around which\n                  all their actions and all their arguments circle, from which all their propositions\n                  radiate.  They look upon slavery as a moral, social, and political wrong, and while\n                  they contemplate it as being such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual\n                  existence among us, for the difficulties of getting rid of it in the States, and for\n                  all the constitutional obligations thrown around it; nevertheless, they do desire\n                  to see a policy instituted that looks to the thing not growing any larger; they insist\n                  upon a policy that shall treat it as a wrong, and as the mildest policy to that end,\n                  they look to the prevention of its growing larger, and to an end of it eventually.\n                  All their sentiments, arguments and propositions, are brought within this range. \n                  Now I have said, and I repeat it here, if there be any man among us who does not think\n                  that the institution of slavery is a wrong — that it is not a wrong in any one of\n                  the aspects in which I have spoken, he is misplaced, and ought not to be among us;\n                  and, if there by a man who is so impatient of it as a wrong, as to disregard the difficulties\n                  of getting rid of it, or as to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown around\n                  it, that man too is misplaced; we disclaim sympathy with him in political action;\n                  he is not placed properly with us."

Now, I don’t care whether that is intended to be expressive of\n                  his individual sentiment upon that subject, or whether it is intended to be expressive\n                  of the national policy that he desires should be carried out;  it is alike valuable\n                  for my purposes.  I say that a man can logically say that if he sees no wrong in it,\n                  but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong.  No man can say\n                  that he does not care if a wrong is voted  up or down, he cannot say that he is indifferent\n                  as to a wrong; but he must have a choice between the right or wrong.  He says that\n                  whatever community desires slavery has a right to it.  He can say so logically if\n                  it is not a wrong, but if he admits that it is wrong, he cannot logically say that\n                  anybody has a right to do wrong.  He says upon the score of equality, slaves should\n                  be allowed to go into the territories the same as other property.  His argument is\n                  logical if the properties are alike, but if one is wrong and the other right, then\n                  he cannot say that, for there is no equality between the right and the wrong.  I say\n                  that everything in the Democratic policy, in the shape it takes in legislation, in\n                  the Dred Scott decision, in their conversations, every one carefully excludes the\n                  thought that there is any thing wrong in it whatever."

But how does he state it?  He says that it needs friendly\n                  legislation, and admits of unfriendly legislation, and that although he admits the\n                  right of the [slave-holder?] to take a slave into the territory, that with unfriendly legislation the people can\n                  really exclude it.   I look to the constitutional authority, and I take the gentleman\n                  who looks me in the face.  We will say he is a member of the territorial legislature;\n                  like Judge Douglas, he believes that the right to take and hold slaves there is a\n                  constitutional right.  The first thing he does is to swear he will support the Constitution;\n                  and suppose his neighbor needs legislation that he may be enabled to enjoy that constitutional\n                  right, can he withhold that legislation which his neighbor needs for the enjoyment\n                  of a right which is fixed in his favor in the Constitution of the United States, which\n                  you remember he has sworn to support without violating his oath, I ask?  And more\n                  especially can he pass unfriendly legislation without violating that oath?  Why, this\n                  is a monstrous sort of talk about the Constitution of the United States! There never\n                  has been such outrageous talk — such lawless talk — about the Constitution of the\n                  United States, from any man of respectability, on the assumption, which he believes,\n                  that the right to hold slaves is a constitutional right.  I don’t believe it is a\n                  constitutional right.  I believe the decision is improperly made, and go for reversing\n                  it.  Judge Douglas is furious in his speech on those who go for reversing it, yet\n                  he goes for legislating from it all its force, while he leaves it standing.  I affirm\n                  here that there never has, from the mouth of a respectable man on earth, been uttered\n                  so monstrous a doctrine.(Applause.)Why, I suppose the most of us, I know I  myself, believe, the people of the southern\n                  States are entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law; that that right is fixed\n                  in the Constitution; that it cannot be made available to them without congressional\n                  legislation; that it is, in the Judge’s language, a barren right, and that it needs\n                  legislation before it can be made efficient, and valuable to the persons to whom it\n                  is granted, and we, such as I, agree that that legislation should be maintained for\n                  them.  On what ground?  We profess not to like that legislation, and perhaps have\n                  no great taste for running after niggers.  I profess to have none — and yet we do.\n                  At least, I yield my support to the fugitive slave law.  Why?  Because I do not understand\n                  that the Constitution which gives that right can be carried out if that legislation\n                  is withheld, and if I believed that the right to hold slaves in a territory was as\n                  firmly fixed as that is, why, on the same principle, I would be bound to give the\n                  legislation necessary to support it, and, I say, that no man can deny his obligation\n                  to give legislation for slave property in a territory, who believes that it is a constitutional\n                  right there.  No man can make such an argument that will not give an Abolitionist\n                  a stronger argument to deny a fugitive slave law.  Try it on and see; if that decision\n                  is correct, then that right of the slave power is as great a right as that of the\n                  slaveholder shall have his slave returned to him, and the man who argues that by unfriendly\n                  legislation, in spite of the constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the\n                  territory, furnishes the argument, and cannot avoid the argument upon which the Abolitionist\n                  may deny the obligation, and may claim the power to furnish unfriendly legislation\n                  against the right of the slaveholder to claim his slave.  I don’t know how such a\n                  argument may take before a popular audience, but I defy any man to go before a court,\n                  or a class of men whose minds are accustomed to hearing arguments of this sort, and\n                  deny that there is a bit of difference between them.  I defy any man to go before\n                  such a class of men — to go and make an argument for adopting unfriendly legislation\n                  in the territories, that will not give an argument against the constitutional right\n                  to a fugitive slave law."

Well, Ficklin, who had served in Congress with him, stood up\n               and told them all that he recollected about it.  It was that whenGeorge Ashmun, ofMassachusetts, brought forward a resolution declaring the war unconstitutional, unnecessary, and\n               unjust, that Lincoln had voted for it.  “Yes,” said Lincoln, “I did.” Thus confessed\n               that he voted that the war was wrong, that our country was in the wrong, and consequently\n               that the Mexicans were in the right; but charged that I had slander him by saying\n               that he voted against the supplies.  I never charged him with voting against the supplies\n               in my life, because I knew that he was not in Congress when they were voted.  (Tremendous\n               shouts of laughter.) The war was commenced on the 13th day of May, 1846, and on that\n               day we appropriated in Congress ten millions of dollars and fifty thousand men to\n               prosecute it.  During the same session we voted more men and more money, and at the\n               next session we voted more men and more money, so that by the time Mr. Lincoln entered\n               Congress we had enough men and enough money to carry on the war, and had no occasion\n               to vote any more. (Laughter and cheers.)  When he got into the House, being opposed\n               to the war, and not being able to stop the supplies, because they had all gone forward,\n               all he could do was to follow the lead ofCorwin, and prove that the war was not begun on the right spot, and that it was unconstitutional,\n               unnecessary, and wrong.  Remember, too, that this he did after the war had been begun.\n               It is one thing to be opposed to the declaration of a war, another and very different\n               thing to take sides with the enemy against your own country after the war has been\n               commenced.  (“Good.” and cheers.) Our army was in Mexico at the time, many battles\n               had been fought; our citizens, who were defending the honor of their country’s flag,\n               were surrounded by the daggers, the guns and the poison of the enemy.  Then it was\n               that Corwin made his speech in which he declared that the American soldiers ought\n               to be welcomed by the Mexicans with bloody hands and hospitable graves; then it was\n               that Ashmun and Lincoln voted in the House of Representatives that the war was unconstitutional\n               and unjust; and Ashmun’s resolution, Corwin’s speech, and Lincoln’s vote were sent\n               to Mexico and read at the head of the Mexican army, to prove to them that there was\n               a Mexican party in the Congress of the United States who were doing all in their power\n               to aid them.  (“That’s the truth,” “Lincoln’s a traitor,” etc.) That a man who takes sides with the common enemy against his own country in time\n               of war should rejoice in a war being made on me now, is very natural.

Did they not\n               thus make it?  It is true that they did not establish slavery in any of the States,\n               or abolish it in any of them; but finding thirteen States twelve of which were slave\n               and one free, they agreed to form a government uniting them together, as they stoo divided into free and slave States, and to guarantee forever to each State the right\n               to do as it pleased on the slavery question.  (Cheers.) Having thus made the government,\n               and conferred this right upon each State forever, I assert that this government can\n               exist as they made it, divided into free and slave States, if any one State chooses\n               to retain slavery.  (Cheers.) He says that he looks forward to a time when slavery\n               shall be abolished everywhere.  I look forward to a time when each State shall be\n               allowed to do as it pleases.  If it chooses to keep slavery forever, it is not my\n               business, but its own; if it chooses to abolish slavery, it is its own business—not\n               mine.  I care more for the great principle of self-government, the right of the people\n               to rule, that I do for all the negroes in Christendom. (Cheers.) I would not endanger\n               the perpetuity of this Union.  I would not blot out the great inalienable rights of\n               the white men for all the negroes that ever existed.

Hence, I\n               say, let us maintain this government on the principles that our fathers made it, recognizing\n               the right of each State to keep slavery as long as it people determine, or to abolish\n               it when they please.  (Cheers.) But Mr. Lincoln says that when our fathers made this\n               government they did not look forward to the state of things now existing; and therefore\n               he thinks the doctrine was wrong; and he quotes Brooks, of South Carolina, to prove\n               that our fathers then thought that probably slavery would be abolished, by each State\n               acting for itself before this time.  Suppose they did; suppose they did not foresee\n               what has occurred,—does that change the principles of our government?  They did not\n               probably foresee the telegraph that transmits intelligence by lightning, nor did they\n               foresee the railroads that now form the bonds of union between the different States,\n               or the thousand mechanical inventions that have elevated mankind.  But do these things\n               change the principles of the government?  Our fathers, I say, made this government\n               on the principle of the right of each State to do as it pleases in its own domestic\n               affairs, subject to the constitution, and allowed the people of each to apply to every\n               new change of circumstance such remedy as they may see fit to improve their condition.\n               This right they have for all time to come.

Mr. Lincoln makes out\n               that line of policy, and appeals to the moral sense of justice, and to the Christian\n               feeling of the community to sustain him.  He says that any man who holds to the contrary\n               doctrine is in the position of the king who claimed to govern by divine right.  Let\n               us examine for a moment and see what principle it was that overthrew the divine right\n               ofGeorge the Thirdto govern us.  Did not these colonies rebel because theBritish parliamenthad no right to pass laws concerning our property and domestic and private institutions\n               without our consent?  We demanded that the British government should not pass such\n               laws unless they gave us representation in the body passing them,—and this the British\n               government insisting on doing,—we went towar, on the principle that the home government should not control and govern distant\n               colonies without giving them a representation.  Now, Mr. Lincoln proposes to govern\n               the territories without giving the people a representation, and calls on Congress\n               to pass laws controlling their property and domestic concerns without their consent\n               and against their will.  Thus, he asserts for his party the identical principle asserted\n               by George III and the tories of theRevolution.  (Cheers.)"

They would thus be driven to the same sectional strife.  Suppose one section\n               makes war upon any other peculiar institution of the opposite section, and the same\n               strife is produced.  They only remedy and safety is that we shall stand by the constitution\n               as our fathers made it, obey the laws, as they are passed, while they stand the proper\n               test and sustain the decisions of the Supreme Court and the constituted authorities."
