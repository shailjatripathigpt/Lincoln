Every man is determined to do his\n\nwhole duty in the greatstrugglein which we are engaged. There is no division among us; we are united as one man.\n\nThe democracy in this and the adjoining counties have been holding a series of mass\n\nmeetings, which have done great good. In this county, Gen.Wm. F. Thornton,S. W. Moulton, the democratic candidate for elector for the sixth district, andA. Thornton, are on the stump and doing yeoman service.John R. Eden, esq., ofMoultrie, is canvassing his county, and in a very effectual manner. AFremontmeeting was advertised there for yesterday, 13th.Lincoln,Bromwelland others were to be there. Gen. Thornton, S. W. Moulton, and A. Thornton, went\n\nthere from Shelby. Lincoln did not make his appearance.Bramwellwas sick, and no Fremont speaker on the ground. Mr.Cullom, of yourcity, was there and opened the meeting with aFillmorespeech. He said Fillmore was aknow-nothing, and was pledged to carry out the principles of the same. He made a flaming tirade\n\nagainst foreigners; was for 21 years residence before allowing them to vote; proscribedCatholics, &c., &c. A regnlar k. n. speech. Mr. Moulton replied to Mr. Cullom, with severity, showing up the absurdities of his\n\nprinciples, their antagonism to the policy and principles o our government, their injustice and inhumanity, and completely exposing the odious\n\nfeatures of the order. The discussion opened the eyes of those who had been drawn into the lodges. They\n\nfully saw the hypocrisy and evil tendency of the k. n. order, and determined to at once repudiate it.– Cullom’s speech made fifty votes\n\nforBuchanan. We hope he will continue in the work. Gen. Thorntonthen addressed the meeting, in behalf of the Union and Buchanan. He made an able\n\nand eloquent speech. At candle lighting the crowd again assembled, and Mr. A. Thornton made a very able\n\nargument in behalf of the great principles of self government; the preservation of\n\nthe Union, and the policy of the democracy. Great good was done in Moultrie. On Saturday, the 9th, the democracy had a great gathering inShelbyville. Hon. A. Lincoln was present. The meeting was opened by a speech of about an hour\n\nand a half, by S. W. Moulton. Mr.M. took strong ground for the democracy, and exposed the hypocrisy and knavery of theblack republicans. He made many strong points and called upon Lincoln to answer them. Lincoln then took the stand and made a three hours speech. It was prosy and dull\n\nin the extreme— all about “freedom,” “libert” and niggers. He answered nothing that had been said by Mr. Moulton, and dodged\n\nevery issue in the present canvass, and attempted to make small side issues of no\n\nimportance. He ridiculed the idea of disunion, and used a great many sophisms to\n\ndivert the public mind from the true issue of the day.2 He was replied to by Mr. A. Thornton, in a very effectual manner. His dodging of\n\nthe true issue was exposed, and all the points made by Lincoln were effectually answered,\n\nand the true issue presented in an able manner. Mr.T. made a very able speech. Our people were disappointed in Lincoln, but attributed his short comings to the want\n\nof merit in his cause. Old Shelby is good for 1,000 democratic majority overallthe isms.3",
