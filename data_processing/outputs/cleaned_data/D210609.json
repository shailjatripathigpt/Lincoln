He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to his political\n                  allies seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

Ray, chief editor of theChicago Tribunein 1854, explained his concerns in a letter to Washburne: “I must confess I am afraid\n                  of ‘Abe.’ He is Southern by birth, Southern in his associations and Southern, if I\n                  mistake not, in his sympathies. . . His wife, you know, is a Todd, of a pro-slavery\n                  family, and so are all his kin. My candidate must be likeCaesor’s wife—not only not suspected, but above suspicion.” Despite his reservations, Ray\n                  soon decided that Lincoln was in fact the best choice for the anti-slavery Republicans\n                  and advised his friends to support Lincoln for the Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln, 181;  Charles H.
