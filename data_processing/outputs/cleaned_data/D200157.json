        "text": "4Butler’s ill-humored letter was precipitated by Lincoln’s role in and position on\n                  the division ofSangamon County. Lincoln opposed division of Sangamon County, but as the first session of the EleventhGeneral Assemblyproceeded, some division appeared inevitable.  The general consensus was to divide\n                  the county into four  equal sized counties, substantially decreasing the size of Sangamon\n                  and isolating it in the corner of one of the new counties.  Using his position on\n                  the Committee on Counties, Lincoln hoped to divide the county in such a manner that\n                  Sangamon would not be disadvantaged.  On January 16,  1839, Lincoln introduced abilldividing Sangamon into three counties.  The House passed the bill on January 21,\n                  creating the three small counties ofLogan,Dane, andMenard, and leaving Sangamon  relatively large.  Butler accused Lincoln of kowtowing to\n                  land speculators.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 145;Edward D.
