        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Parks to which this is a response has not been located\n                  but it was likely similar to others that Lincoln wrote in November and December of\n                  1854 soliciting the support of newly-elected members of theIllinois General Assemblyfor his potential candidacy for U.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.

        "text": "3The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate. Parks cast his vote for Lincoln in all of the first nine rounds\n                  of voting. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped\n                  out of contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Parks voted for Trumbull\n                  in the tenth round of voting, at which point Trumbull was declared the victor.
