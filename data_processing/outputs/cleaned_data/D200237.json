Many of the proprietors of these settlements abandoned\n                  them during and after thePanic of 1837. As a result, theGeneral Assemblyreceived a large number of petitions for vacation during their sessions from 1838\n                  to 1841. In 1841, the legislature passed anactsetting parameters for proprietors to vacate town plats themselves. Vacating a plat\n                  gave owners greater flexibility in the use, fencing, and sale of the property.An Act to Vacate Town Plats; Alasdair Roberts,America’s First Great Depression: Economic Crisis and Political Disorder after the\n                        Panic of 1837(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2012), 19, 33, 38; James E.
