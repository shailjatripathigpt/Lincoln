For the first part of the election campaign of 1858, Lincoln had often followed\n                  Douglas on the  trail, delivering speeches either later in the evening after Douglas\n                  finished, or the next day. In an August 2lettertoJoseph T. Eccles, however, Lincoln noted that in correspondence Douglas had indicated that “my presence,\n                  on the days or evenings of his meetings would be considered an intrusion.” Lincoln\n                  and Douglas eventually agreed to a series of formal debates during which they would\n                  address one another before the same audience. These became known as theLincoln-Douglas Debates. See the1858 Federal Election.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:458, 483-85."
