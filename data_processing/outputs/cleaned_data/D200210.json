On Lincoln’s motion, the House referred the bill to a select\n                  committee that included Lincoln.  Lincoln of the select committee reported back the\n                  bill on January 28, 1840, with an amendment.  The House amended the select committee’s\n                  amendment by adding an additional section relating to the collector ofOgle County.  The House adopted the select committee’s amendment as amended.   On January 30,\n                  the House passed the bill as amended, on Lincoln’s motion amending the title so as\n                  to read, “A Bill in relation to Taking Depositions, and in relation toMenardandLoganCounties.” The House informed theSenateof the bill’s passage, but the latter took no action.Illinois HouseJournal. 1839. 11th G.

        "text": "3It appears that this is the version of thebillLincoln of the select committee reported back to the House on January 28, 1840. \n                  The select committee added sections one and three, and incorporated the substance\n                  of Lincoln’s originalbillwith amendments--the committee filled in the blank with “Menard County” and added\n                  “for the year 1839”--as the second section.  Missing from this version is the additional\n                  section added by the House concerning the collector of Ogle County.Lincoln presumably left the county name blank in his originalbill, leaving it to the select committee to fill in the name, and the select committee\n                  added the third section, because questions remained over the boundary between Sangamon\n                  and Menard counties.  Section one of theactestablishing Menard County set its boundaries, but theSenateinserted a proviso in the fourth section altering the boundaries if the commissioners\n                  selected for the task located the county seat on the west or left side of theSangamon River.  The House passed anamendment, authored and moved by Lincoln, modifying the proposed Senate boundaries, and the\n                  proviso with Lincoln’s amendment became part of theact.  (The first clause of boundaries delineated in Lincoln’samendmentand the originalbillare identical.)The proviso shifted a portion of the boundary between Sangamon and Menard counties\n                  further north and west, leaving more territory to the north and west ofAthens.   On May 18, 1839, the commissioners appointed for the task located the county seat\n                  atPetersburg, on the western side of the river, activating the proviso.  The status of approximately\n                  22 sections west and north of Athens, however,  remained in question.    The affected\n                  area did not include the town of Athens, which remained in Sangamon County.  In 1840,Thomas J. Nanceunsuccessfully attempted to address the confusion by introducing abillthat repealed this proviso and designated this area as part of Menard County.  A\n                  year later,John Bennettintroduced  abillto settle the boundary between Sangamon and Menard counties.  After the House refused\n                  to engross it, Bennett tried again unsuccessfully to enact its main provisions in\n                  anotherbill. The General Assembly did not resolve the issue until it passed an act in 1843 adding\n                  land west of the Sangamon River to Menard County and an additional act in 1847 adding\n                  land east of the Sangamon River, including Athens, to Menard County.Illinois HouseJournal. 1838. 11th G.
