        "text": "4John M. Palmermay have been referring to the August 1858 meeting ofMacoupin CountyRepublicans in Carlinville, Illinois, which was held to nominate candidates for county\n                  offices. County Republicans previously held a convention in Carlinville on June 14.\n                  The American Party of Macoupin County held also held a convention on September 6.Lincolnrepliedto Woods’ letter on July 25, asking Woods to show his reply to Palmer. Lincoln alsowrotePalmer on August 5, promising to speak in Carlinville on August 31. He did so, and\n                  Palmer spoke after him.For the first part of the election campaign of 1858, Lincoln often followed Douglas\n                  on the  trail, delivering speeches either later in the evening after Douglas finished,\n                  or the next day. It was not until July 24 that Lincoln challenged Douglas to a series\n                  of formal debates. Douglas eventually agreed, and these became the famousLincoln-Douglas Debates.In appealing to former members of the American Party, Douglas adopted a campaign strategy\n                  labelling Republicans sectional agitators andabolitionistsdevoted to elevating African Americans to social and political equality with whites.In the local elections of 1858, Douglas and the Democrats ultimately proved more adept\n                  than the Republicans in attracting the votes of former members of the American Party.\n                  For instance, of the fourteen counties where the American Party vote had an impact\n                  on the election for state representatives, Democrats carried eleven of the fourteen\n                  counties. One of these counties,Madison, sent two former members of the American Party to theIllinois House of Representativesin1856, but shifted to the Democrats in 1858. Republicans won a majority of all votes cast\n                  in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and, in the federal election of 1858, Douglas\n                  won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within\n                  the national Republican Party.The Alton Weekly Courier(IL), 2 September 1858, 1:5; 24 June 1858, 2:1;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 10 September 1858, 3:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:482-85, 487-545, 547, 554-56;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 31 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-31; Report of Speech at Carlinville, Illinois;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.
