Crittenden was Taylor’s first choice for any cabinet position of the former’s\n                  choosing, but Crittenden steadfastly rejected the president-elect’s entreaties to\n                  join the cabinet.  Crittenden’s support of Taylor as theWhig Partynominee in1848alienatedHenry Clay, who coveted the nomination, destroying their political alliance.  Hoping to sustain\n                  his reputation for honesty and perhaps out of deference to Clay, Crittenden refused\n                  a cabinet post.  Besides, he had won election as governor ofKentucky, and felt an obligation to serve.Thomas E. Stephens, \"Crittenden, John Jordan,\"American National Biography, ed. by John A. Garraty and Mark C.
