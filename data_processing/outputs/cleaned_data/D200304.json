TheElection of 1840resulted in aWhigmajority in Congress, which supported a higher tariff to restrain imports and protect\n                  domestic industries and manufacturing. In June 1842, the Congress passed a new tariff\n                  bill, but PresidentJohn Tyler, a formerDemocrat, vetoed it. On August 30, Congress passed and Tyler signed a compromise bill, the\n                  Tariff Act of 1842.Michael F.
