        "text": "2Lincoln is asking Willie P. Mangum, aWhigwho was serving as North Carolina’s representative in theU.S. Senateat the time of this letter, about Winfield Scott’s chances for victory in the state\n                  during thepresidential election of 1852.The Whig Party had nominated Scott as their candidate for president andWilliam A. Grahamas their candidate for vice-president during their convention in June 1852 in the\n                  hope that a Scott-Graham ticket would enable the party to remain bisectional and appealing\n                  to both Northern and Southern Whigs. Scott was the favorite candidate of most Northern\n                  Whigs, and Graham was a slaveholder from North Carolina. After Graham’s nomination\n                  to the party’s ticket, a North Carolina delegate pledged that Scott and Graham would\n                  carry that state by at least 10,000 votes. Ultimately, although many Southern Whigs\n                  were pleased with Graham’s nomination, they were far less enthusiastic about Scott.\n                  The contest was close in North Carolina, with the Democrats carrying the vote by 39,744\n                  to 39,058, but the  Whig Party suffered a devastating national defeat. TheDemocratic Party’s candidate,Franklin Pierce, won 254 electoral votes to Scott’s 42.Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1996(Alexandria, VA: CQ Staff Directories, 1997), 143, 145; Michael F.
