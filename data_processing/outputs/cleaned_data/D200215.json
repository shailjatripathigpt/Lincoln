        "text": "6The editors make reference to Democrats appointed to federal offices, who received\n                  federal income. Whigs believed this made these men dangerously loyal to their party\n                  and President Van Buren, giving them an advantage in theupcoming election.  The Whigs had good reasons to fear: the number of federal officeholders had been\n                  greatly expanded by the system to take the 1840 census, and the officeholders did\n                  involve themselves in advancing the Democratic cause.  This was particularly true\n                  of postmasters, who distributed copies of theExtra Globe, the official campaign sheet and, according to some, blocked distribution of Whig\n                  campaign literature.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 21 February 1840, 2:2; Major L.

        "text": "7Amos Kendall, director of Van Buren’s re-election bid in 1840, instead of trying to defend the\n                  president, who had become increasingly unpopular due to his stumbling response to\n                  thePanic of 1837, launched a newspaper campaign attacking Harrison’s physical fitness for office,\n                  military exploits, and civic achievements. Harrison had only a sparse legislative\n                  record, so Kendall and the Democratic press often focused on his military career,\n                  where there was more grist for the mill.
