        "text": "2Elihu B. Washburne had written to Lincoln on bothMay 2andMay 6, 1858 in response to a rumor that he was encouragingIllinoisRepublicans to support Stephen A. Douglas’ bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein theelection of 1858.In aletterof April 19, 1858 to Lincoln,John Wentworthconveyed a report that one of the Republican members of theU.S. Congressfrom Illinois had written a letter urging Republicans to back Douglas. LincolnwroteWashburne regarding the rumor on April 26, assuring Washburne that although suspicion\n                  centered on him, Lincoln was confident the matter was a misunderstanding. Washburnerespondedto Lincoln on May 2, denying the rumor, thenwrote againon May 6, enclosing the letter in controversy for Lincoln to peruse himself.This controversial letter was one written by Washburne to Charles L. Wilson on April\n                  12, 1858. The manuscript original of Washburne’s letter to Wilson has not been located,\n                  but it was subsequently published in thePolo Advertiserin 1860. In this letter, Washburne discussed his confusion over the current state\n                  of politics in Illinois in light of the rift in theDemocratic Partybetween supporters of Douglas and supporters of President James Buchanan, which was\n                  caused by Douglas’ criticism of theLecompton Constitutionand of the president’s support of it. Washburne stated that despite his dislike of\n                  Douglas, he would welcome him as an ally to the Republican Party, but expressed concern\n                  over whether there was a movement to create a Douglas party in Illinois and an attempt\n                  to reelect Douglas. Republicans should not abandon their platform, wrote Washburne,\n                  and their candidate for U.S. Senate in the election of 1858 must be Lincoln.Russell K.

        "text": "5The rift between Douglas and Buchanan had recently led to their supporters holding\n                  two separate Democratic Party conventions in Illinois. The two factions of the Illinois\n                  Democratic Party held their April 21, 1858 conventions at the Illinois State House,\n                  with Douglas supporters in the hall of theIllinois House of Representatives, and the Buchanan supporters in theSenateChamber. Both groups claimed to be answering the same call to meeting issued by the\n                  Democratic State Executive Committee. The DemocraticIllinois State Registerseemed to be downplaying the significance of the split around the date of this letter,\n                  dismissing the Buchanan Democrats as self-serving office seekers or bolters from the\n                  Democratic Party, of which the Douglas supporters in Illinois were depicted as being\n                  in the mainstream.  TheIllinois State Registerargued that these bolters from the Democratic Party were few in number, and suggested\n                  that Buchanan denounce them to preserve the Democratic Party. Following the passage\n                  of the English bill, the newspaper signaled that it and Douglas were moving on from\n                  opposition to this administration measure now that it was settled, and a reconciliation\n                  between Douglas and the administration seemed possible.Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 30 April 1858, 2:1; 3 May 1858, 2:2; 6 May 1858, 2:2; 8 May 1858,\n                     2:1; Franklin William Scott,Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, vol. 6 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1910), 323;Abraham Lincoln to Elihu B.
