On February\n                  28, the legislature chose Springfield as the new Illinois state capital.  Lincoln\n                  voted for Springfield all four times. The same act that authorized the new capital\n                  also stipulated that  the chosen location donate to the state $50,000 towards construction\n                  costs for a new statehouse. Springfield residents negotiated to make the payment in\n                  three installments, but many of the bond holders, financially affected by thePanic of 1837, were unable to pay their promised final shares. The 101 signers here borrowed the\n                  final installment from the State Bank of Illinois. The loan was paid off on February\n                  19, 1846.John Carroll Power and S. A.
