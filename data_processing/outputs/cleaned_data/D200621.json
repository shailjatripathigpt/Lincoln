        "text": "2If a paper was enclosed with this letter, it has not been located.PresidentZachary TaylorhadappointedLincoln secretary of the Oregon Territory August 9, 1849, less than a month after\n                  he appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront to  Whigs inIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln the position of  secretary of\n                  the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. But in aletterto Secretary of State John M. Clayton dated August 21, 1849, Lincoln declined the\n                  appointment for secretary of the Oregon Territory  and recommended Francis for the\n                  position instead. He subsequently sent Clayton several other letters reiterating his\n                  desire for Francis to receive the appointment.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Abraham Lincoln to John M.

        "text": "3In the end, President Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory. On September 20, 1849, in a final effort to ease\n                  any tensions caused by Butterfield’s appointment, the Taylor administration also offered\n                  Lincoln appointment as governor of the Oregon Territory. After serious consideration\n                  of this offer, Lincoln also declined this position, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Francis’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did\n                  not receive any other appointment during this period. The 1861 official register shows\n                  Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:307;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1855(Washington, DC: A.
