See1854 Federal Election.Abraham Lincoln agreed to speak in Peoria, Illinois, on October 16, 1854, ahead of\n                  the congressional elections.   Stephen A. Douglas spoke for more than three hours,\n                  and, after a break, Lincoln also spoke for three hours about the repeal of the Missouri\n                  Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska  Act. A pro-Lincoln newspaper opined, “It was a\n                  powerful speech, and even the Nebraskaites acknowledge it to have been a powerful\n                  effort; and nearly every one who heard it said it was unanswerable.”David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.
