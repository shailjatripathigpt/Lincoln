        "text": "3Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.\n                  Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.When the General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, ten rounds of\n                  voting were needed to finally determine a victor. Lincoln received a majority of the\n                  anti-Nebraska votes until the tenth and final ballot, when he withdrew and urged his\n                  supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With the votes\n                  of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See the1854 Federal Election.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.
