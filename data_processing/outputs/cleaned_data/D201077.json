Hyde was found guilty in the\n                  Chicago Recorder’s Court on February 27, 1857, and was sentenced to four years in\n                  the Illinois State Penitentiary at Alton.Acquaintances of Hyde inMassachusettsand in Chicago signed petitions addressed toIllinoisGovernorWilliam H. Bissellurging that Hyde be pardoned and also met with the governor, but beyond Lincoln’s\n                  correspondence with Daniel S. Dickinson on the subject, there is no evidence that\n                  Lincoln involved himself in Hyde’s case. Bissell pardoned Hyde in October 1858 on\n                  the condition that he leave Illinois and never return.Evening Star(Washington, DC), 9 August 1856, 3:1;The Daily Democratic Press(Chicago, IL), 28 February 1857, 3:1;Hyde requested Lincoln’s assistance in obtaining pardon, Martha L.
