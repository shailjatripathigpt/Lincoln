    "full_text": "George T. M. Davis to Abraham Lincoln, 20 February 18491 I send you herewith a recommendation in favor ofBen BondEsqr for Marshall, signed by most of theDemocraticmembers (including theLieutenant Governor) of both branches of theIllinois legislature.2I hope you will present it with his other papers that he has transmitted to you,\n\nand that through your andColBakers influence you will secure the appointment for him. In my opinion he will be of more\n\nessential service to us, than any other man inIllinoisif he succeeds, in revolutionising that state at the next election.3I fear from all I can see and learn that Col Baker will be disappointed in securing a cabinet appointment; but in this I hope\n\nI may be mistaken and that he will succeed. I do not think that there is anyseriousidea entertained in thiscityof the success of MrBates, and there is certainly but very little feeling on the subject. The selection of\n\neither Baker or Smith would give full as general satisfaction as that of MrBates under all the circumstances.4 I havepersonal favorto ask of you in regard to thePost Officein this City. There are a number of applicants, among whom isC G RamsayEsqr, the joint proprietor with MrYeatmanin theNew Era. He was the first man to circulate the call for a public meeting in this City to\n\nnominateGenlTaylorfor thePresidency, and his paper was thefirstin the valley of theMississippito run up the Taylor flag. No more honest, upright, capable man can be found in the\n\nCity of St Louis, and for twelve years he has manfully battled forWhigprinciples without ever before having been an applicant for any office.Weimerthe present incumbent took violent<Page 2>ground against Genl Taylor, and the clerks in his office on election day violently assailed and villified the President elect. Under these circumstances, I think he should be removed, which\n\nif done, the place ought to be given to Ramsay. I refer you to MrYeatman as to the character and number of recommendations MrRamsay has received and forwarded to him from this community, and then leave it to\n\nyour own sense of propriety to determine whether you can consistently lend him your\n\ninfluence and aid. To me personally it will be a great favor, and if you can confer\n\nit, the day may roll round when I can be of the most essential service to you. The\n\ncirculation of theErais increasing throughout Illinois with great rapidity, and if it continues at its\n\npresent ratio, but a very few months will elapse before I shall have the largest circulation\n\nin your state of any paper in the west. You can be of essential service toMrR, if you feel so inclined, and I should be pleased if you can find time if you will\n\ndrop me a line in regard to the matter. You probably are aware thatChambersof theRepublicanrefusedto sign the original call for a Taylor meeting in this city. I mean in a few days\n\nto republish the call as originally appearing in the Era. By giving your assistance\n\nto MrRamsay, you can lay me under obligations to you that I never can forget or will fail\n\nto reciprocate.5",
