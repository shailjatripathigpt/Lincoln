        "text": "3GeerwroteLincoln again on August 2, noting that he had received a letter from Lincoln dated\n                  July 30. Lincoln’s July 30 letter to Geer has not been located. On September 13, GeerwroteLincoln another letter related to theelection campaign of 1858.Douglas delivered a campaign address in Peoria, Illinois on August 18. Lincoln delivered\n                  a speech the next day, after the adjournment of the aforementioned congressional convention.\n                  Kellogg addressed the crowd after Lincoln, but there is no evidence that Illinois\n                  Governor William H. Bissell either attended the event or delivered a speech.In the congressional election for the Fourth District, Kellogg won election to the\n                  U.S. House of Representatives with 52.8 percent of the vote compared to 45.7 percent\n                  for his pro-Douglas Democratic rival,James W. Davidson, and 1.5 percent for his pro-BuchananDemocratic opponent, Jacob Gale. At the time, members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; hence, the\n                  outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewould decide the senatorial contest. Republicans won a majority of all votes cast\n                  in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the General Assembly, and\n                  Douglas ultimately won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular\n                  through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 21 July 1858, 2:1;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 19 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-19;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 21 August 1858, 2:3; 27 September 1858, 2:2; Howard W.
