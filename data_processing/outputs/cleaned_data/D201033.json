Browning replied to Lincoln on June 25, but his reply has not been located. However,\n                  the case outcome reveals that Lincoln and Browning did not delay the case.In March 1857, Mrs. Mary Macready fell into a hole while walking on a public sidewalk\n                  inAlton, Illinois, injuring her ankle, leg, and back. Incapacitated after the fall, she missed a business\n                  engagement and spent $500 on medical expenses. She retainedLincoln & Herndonand Browning & Bushnell, who sued the city of Alton in theU.S. Circuit Court, Southern District of Illinoisin April 1858 in an action of trespass and requested $20,000 in damages for the city’s\n                  negligence in maintaining the sidewalks and failure to properly warn members of the\n                  public of ongoing repairs and hazards. In June 1858, the jury found for Macready and\n                  awarded $300 in damages.Macready v. Alton, Illinois, Martha L.
