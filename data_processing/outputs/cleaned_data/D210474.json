Herrickin January 1849, Abraham Lincoln indicated that he had not pledged himself to any\n                  candidate, and was uncertain how to advise any of them.Davis wrote Lincoln several other letters regarding his application, urging Lincoln\n                  to respond whether he had received the application materials and whether they had\n                  been forwarded to the proper department.  In aletterfrom Davis dated April 9, 1849, Lincoln endorsed it by writing “Ansdbefore written.” Lincoln’s answer, however, has not been found.  Lincoln did not\n                  respond to the other letters.Davis received the appointment, serving as register from July 1849 until 1853.David M. Woodson to Abraham Lincoln;James M.
