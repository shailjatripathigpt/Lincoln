        "text": "1TheDaily Illinois State Journalextracted this summary of remarks by Abraham Lincoln from the original printedversionwhich appeared in the BloomingtonDaily Pantagraphon July 19, 1858. TheDaily Illinois State Journalpreceded these remarks with a summary of Stephen A. Douglas’ recent public appearances\n                  as he traveled fromChicagotoSpringfield, in which the newspaper painted his early efforts in thesenatorial campaign of 1858as unsuccessful. The newspaper then included a brief description of Douglas’ July\n                  16, 1858 arrival and speech inBloomington, followed by areportof remarks made by Lincoln at that speech. No manuscript version of Lincoln’s remarks\n                  at Atlanta has been located.Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  efforts in the 1858 election campaign on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Lincoln had traveled from Springfield to Bloomington on the day preceding this and\n                  attended Douglas’ speech in Bloomington that evening. After attending the speech by\n                  Douglas in Atlanta on July 17 at which he made these remarks, Lincoln returned to\n                  Springfield, where he delivered a speech of his own in the evening.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-58, 476-77; Allen C.\n                     Guelzo, “Houses Divided: Lincoln, Douglas, and the Political Landscape of 1858,”The Journal of American History94 (September 2007), 392-94, 400-401;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 16 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-16; 17 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-17;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois."
