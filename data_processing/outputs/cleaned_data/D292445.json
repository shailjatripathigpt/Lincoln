Can such a result be provided for<Page 2>by a fair mutual arrangement between the friends of MrFilmore and those of Mr Fremont? I think it can: and earnestly invite your consideration of the proposition which occurs\n\nto me as being the fairest and most promising— and if it meets with your approval,\n\nI hope you will pass it along. It is this:— Get 10 out of the 11 State Electors, be united upon by the friends of\n\nMrFilmore and of Mr. Fremont,— and let the Eleventh nameson their separate tickets beanames chosen by them respectively as being indicative of their peculiar Presidential\n\npreferences. Get the 10 common Electors, accept their nominations with a pledge to\n\ncast the Electoral vote for Filmore or Fremont as the 11thname may receive on either ticket the highest vote. TheElectoral College, if the united opposition succeeded, would then consist of the ten individuals whose\n\nnames were agreed upon, and of the highest name on the Buchanan Ticket: the 10 being\n\nfully and fairly instructed how to cast the vote. I have submitted this proposition toYatesand others, and they concur with me in the opinion that if the arrangement can be\n\neffected, it will insure success to our opposition to Buchanan– I pray you to think of it. I repeat that I feel sometimes quite discouraged about\n\nthe triangle in which we are likely to fork out^in slender convergents^from a solid base that may be given to Buchanan. I find my causes of concern in the\n\ncourse which theNY Tribuneseems disposed to pursue towards MrFilmore,5and in the demonstrations in other quarters towards MrFremont— and I am satisfied that unless a provisional agreement be made in time,\n\nserious discords are likely to separate us in the midst of one of the most important,\n\ninteresting, and hopeful campaigns in which any of us were ever enlisted. I have had to write amidst some interruptions— but hope you will understand my views,\n\nand heed them a little for the sake of the cause.6",

        "text": "6Lincolnrespondedthe next day, July 10. Promising to consider Berdan’s plan to furnish supporters\n                  of Fremont and Fillmore to the Electoral College for Illinois, Lincoln took it a step\n                  further and suggested uniting the two men onto one ticket. In September, Lincoln wrote\n                  to several of his connections asking for the names of Fillmore supporters. He then\n                  sent lithographed form letters to the names provided. The form letters informed the\n                  Fillmore supporters that every vote for their candidate in Illinois lessened his chance\n                  of becoming president.  Lincoln and his fellow Republicans failed to convince Fillmore’s\n                  supporters to unite, allowing Democrats  to label their opponents as both nativists\n                  and worshippers of African Americans.  Berdan’s and Lincoln’s prediction proved prophetic:\n                  Buchanan captured Illinois with 44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont\n                  and 15.7 for Fillmore, and Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore to become fifteenth\n                  president of the United States. Indeed, if the votes received by Fremont and Fillmore\n                  in Illinois had been combined, Buchanan’s vote would not have been sufficient to carry\n                  the state.
