Hon.Abraham Lincolnhits the nail on the head every time, and in this instance it will be seen, he has\n\ndriven it entirely out of sight,— if we succeed as well as we anticipate in re-producing\n\nfrom memory his argument in relation to “Disunion.” Mr.Lincolnwas addressing himself to the opponents ofFremontand theRepublican party,2and had referred to the charge of “sectionalism,” and then spoke something as follows\n\nin relation to another charge, and said: “You further charge us with being Disunionists. If you mean that it is ouraimto dissolve the Union, for myself I answer, that is untrue; for those who act with\n\nme I answer, that it is untrue. Have you heard us assert that as our aim? Do you\n\nreally believe that such is our aim? Do you find it in our platform, our speeches,\n\nour conversation, or anywhere? If not, withdraw the charge. But, you may say, that though it is not youraim, it will be the result, if we succeed, and that we are therefore Disunionists in\n\nfact. This is a grave charge you make against us, and we certainly have a right to\n\ndemand that you specify in what way we are to dissolve the Union. How are we to effect\n\nthis? The only specification offered is volunteered by Mr.Fillmore, in hisAlbanyspeech. His charge is, that if we elect a President and Vice President both from\n\nthe Free States, it will dissolve the Union.3This is open folly. The Constitution provides, that the President and Vice President\n\nof the United States shall be of different States; but says nothing as to the latitude\n\nand longitude of those States4In1828,Andrew JacksonofTennesse, andJohn C. CalhounofSouth Carolina, were elected President and Vice President, both from slave States; but no one thought\n\nof dissolving the Union then, on that account. In1840,HarrisonofOhio, andTylerofVirginia, were elected. In 1849, Harrison died,5and John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency, andW. P. Mangum, ofN. Carolina, was elected Acting Vice President by theSenate;6but no one supposed that the Union was in danger. In fact, at the very time Mr.\n\nFillmore uttered this idle charge, the state of things in the United States disproved\n\nit. MrPierceofNew Hampshire, and MrBrightofIndiana,— both from free States,— are President and Vice President; and the Union stands,\n\nandwillstand.7You do not contend that itoughtto dissolve the Union, and the facts show that itwon’t; therefore, the charge may be dismissed without further consideration. No other specification is made, and the only one that could be made is, that the restoration\n\nof the restriction of ‘87, making the United States territory free territory, would dissolve the Union. Gentlemen,\n\nit will require a decided majority to pass such an act. We the majority, being able\n\nconstitutionally to do all that we purpose, would have no desire to dissolve the UnionDo you say that such restriction of slavery would be unconstitutional and that some\n\nof the States would not submit to its enforcement? I grant you that an unconstitutional\n\nact is not a law; but I do not ask, and will not take your construction of the Constitution.\n\nTheSupreme Court of the United Statesis the tribunal to decide such questions, and we will submit to its decisions; and\n\nif you do also, there will be an end of the matter.

In this speech, Fillmore criticized the Republican\n                  Party for nominating a presidential and vice-presidential candidate who were both\n                  from free states and claimed that the party was a “sectional party” representing only\n                  the interests of the free states of the nation. He asserted that this was dangerous\n                  and argued that if the Republican Party gained power it would lead “inevitably to\n                  the destruction” of the nation.Frank H.

        "text": "6Upon the death of William H. Harrison, confusion reigned over a successor.  The U.S.\n                  Constitution was ambiguous over presidential succession, and the judiciary had never\n                  issued an official pronouncement on the issue.  Article two, section one of the Constitution\n                  stated that upon the death of a president, the duties and powers of the office devolved\n                  upon the vice president, so Vice President John Tyler assumed the office of the president.\n                  Tyler’s ascendancy to the presidency left the vice-presidency vacant, leaving theU.S. Senatewithout a president.    Under article one, section three of the Constitution, the\n                  Senate president pro tempore assumed the duties of president of the Senate in the\n                  absence of the vice president.   Since President Tyler had no vice president, this\n                  technically made the president pro tempore of the Senate the acting vice president\n                  of the United States.Thereportin theDaily Illinois State JournalidentifiedWilliam R. D. King, not Willie P. Mangum, as the person elected president pro tempore of the Senate\n                  after Tyler assumed the presidency.  Neither account was accurate; Samuel L. Southard\n                  ofNew Jerseysucceeded King as the Senate’s president pro-tempore on March 11, 1841, serving until\n                  May 1842.  Mangum succeeded Southard, serving from May 1842 to March 1845.  In the\n                  absence of a vice president, Southard and Mangum were, in effect, acting vice presidents\n                  of the United States.Norma Lois Peterson,The Presidencies of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler(Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1989), 45-50; U.S. Const. art.
