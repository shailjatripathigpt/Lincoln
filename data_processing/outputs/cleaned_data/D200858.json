        "text": "2At the outbreak of the Black Hawk War, Lincoln volunteered for theIllinois State Militia. On April 21, 1832, Lincoln and other men from theNew Salemarea were mustered into a company in the Fourth Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers,\n                  and the members of the company elected Lincoln as their captain. When his month of\n                  service ended, Lincoln reenlisted twice, for twenty and thirty days respectively,\n                  serving as a private both times. He was finally discharged on July 10, 1832.On September 28, 1850, theU.S. Congresspassed an act granting certain groups who had served in the United States military\n                  during theWar of 1812, any of “the Indian wars” since 1790, or theMexican Warparcels of public land. Per this act, the amount of land that veterans (or their\n                  legal heirs) were entitled to depended upon the length of their engagement and actual\n                  time served. Under this act, Lincoln was entitled to forty acres of public land for\n                  the time he served as captain of the Fourth Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers,\n                  and on June 1, 1855 hepatentedforty acres inTama County, Iowa.Muster Roll of Abraham Lincoln’s Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Abraham Lincoln’s Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Captain Elijah Iles’ Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Captain Jacob M.

        "text": "3Lincoln was prompted to make this affidavit  by an additional act passed by the U.S.\n                  Congress on March 3, 1855, which declared that all those who had served in any U.S.\n                  war since 1790 were entitled to receive 160 acres of land in total. Lincoln affirmed\n                  here that he had received the forty acres he was originally entitled to in order to\n                  claim the additional 120 acres authorized by the new law. The additional 120-acre\n                  parcel of bounty land that  Lincoln patented on September 10, 1860 was located inCrawford County, Iowa, 144 miles west of his Tama County land. There is no evidence that Lincoln ever received\n                  any revenue from any of his bounty lands. After his assassination, since he did not\n                  leave a will, the Tama County land passed in one-third equal divisions toMary Lincoln,Robert T. Lincoln, andThomas “Tad” Lincoln. The Crawford County land also passed to the remaining Lincoln family.Earlier this same month Lincoln had attested in a similaraffidavitas to the identity and service  ofCharles R. Pierce, who had served as a private under Lincoln in the Fourth Regiment of Illinois Mounted\n                  Volunteers, in order to assist Pierce in obtaining his own additional 120 acres of\n                  bounty lands.“An Act in Addition to Certain Acts Granting Bounty Land to Certain Officers and Soldiers\n                     Who Have Been Engaged in the Military Service of the United States,” 3 March 1855,Statutes at Large of the United States10 (1855):701-2;Land Warrant to Abraham Lincoln; Certification of Land Warrant to Abraham Lincoln; Certification of Location of Land Warrant for Abraham Lincoln’s Black Hawk War Service; Harry E.
