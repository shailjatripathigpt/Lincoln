Kinkead’s June 8, 1854 letter to Edwards has not been located.In the case,Edward OldhamandThomas Hemingway, the surviving partners ofOldham, Todd and Company, which had includedRobert S. Todd, father ofMary Lincoln, claimed that the company had hired Lincoln and Edwards to collect some debts for\n                  them inIllinois.  Oldham and Hemingway claimed that Lincoln, Edwards, and Kinkead failed to pay them\n                  $472.54.  In June 1853, Oldham and Hemingway sued Lincoln and others in theKentucky Fayette County Circuit Courtin a chancery action to recover the debt.  In February 1854, after depositions Lincoln\n                  took supported his version of events, Oldham and Hemingway dismissed the case.On March 31, 1854, Lincoln wrote Kinkead aletter, authorizing him to retain whatever fee he deemed suitable for his work on the case.Abraham Lincoln to George B.
