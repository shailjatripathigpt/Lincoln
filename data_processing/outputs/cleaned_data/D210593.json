        "text": "3Early reports suggested that Archer had likely defeated incumbentDemocratJames C. Allen in the1854 racefor U.S. Representative in Illinois’ Seventh Congressional District by a majority\n                  of over a thousand votes. As county returns were slowly certified, Archer’s lead dropped\n                  throughout November 1854 in the manner he describes here, and the race was ultimately\n                  decided in Allen’s favor by one vote. In the final vote tabulations, Clay County voters\n                  cast 593 votes for Allen and 347 for Archer.  In Jasper County, Allen received  452\n                  votes to 383 for Archer, while in Moultrie County, voters cast 365 votes for Archer\n                  and 262 for Allen.  Archer contested the election andCongressvacated the seat and a special election was held for the seat in 1856, which Allen\n                  won.Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 14 November 1854, 2:2; 16 November 1854, 3:1; 20 November 1854, 3:1;\n                     29 November 1854, 2:3; 9 December 1854, 2:4; Howard W.

        "text": "4In November and December of 1854 Lincoln undertook a letter writing campaign soliciting\n                  his allies’ help in canvassing theirIllinois General Assemblymembers for support of his potential candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate. See the1854 Federal Election.The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate.  Newly-elected representative Thomas R. McClure from Clark County\n                  cast his vote for Lincoln in all of the first nine rounds of voting. After the ninth\n                  vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged\n                  his remaining supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. McClure voted for Trumbull\n                  in the tenth round of voting, at which point Trumbull was declared the victor.
