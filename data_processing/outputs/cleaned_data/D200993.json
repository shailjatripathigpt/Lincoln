Lanphier & Walker v. Hatch.In this case,IllinoisSecretary of StateOzias M. Hatchwas being sued in theIllinois Supreme Courtto furnish state printers Lanphier & Walker of theDemocraticIllinois State Registerwith a true copy of an 1857 bill apportioning representation in theIllinois General Assembly. The bill had been drafted and supported by the Democrats with an eye towards maintaining\n                  their party’s majority in the General Assembly. TheIllinois House of Representativespassed the bill on February 16, 1857, and theIllinois Senateconcurred on February 18.RepublicanGovernorWilliam H. Bissellmistakenly signed the bill then cancelled his signature after his secretary had already\n                  reported his approval to the House. Hatch retained Lincoln,Orville H. Browning, andJackson Grimshawfor his defense. Neither Gillespie nor Koerner were attorneys of record on the case.\n                  The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in Hatch’s favor in February 1858.Abraham Lincoln to Joseph Gillespie;Abraham Lincoln to Gustave P.
