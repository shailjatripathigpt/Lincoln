        "text": "2On August 15, 1851, Daniel E. Ruckel signed apromissory noteto Lincoln for a $300 mortgage at an interest rate of ten percent per year for several\n                  lots of land Ruckel wished to purchase in Springfield, Illinois. He made one payment\n                  to Lincoln in January 1854, but died on April 9, 1854, before he could repay the remainder\n                  of the debt. Shortly after his death, his brother,Jacob Ruckel, andRichard H. Beachbecame the administrators of his estate. After Lincoln released the above lots of\n                  “Allen’s addition to Springfield” from the mortgage Daniel had owed him, Jacob Ruckel\n                  and Beach, as the administrators of Daniel’s estate, likely made another payment in\n                  December 1854. In addition, in areceiptdated September 28, 1857, Lincoln noted that he received $300 from Jacob, which was\n                  the principal of the mortgage that he originally gave to Daniel. This settled the\n                  mortgage in full, and Lincoln noted that he would hand over the original mortgage\n                  and note, and that Beach would settle the remaining interest due to Lincoln on the\n                  loan.As  noted on the verso of Daniel Ruckel’s originalpromissory note, Beach indeed made two additional payments—one in 1856 and another in 1857. On September\n                  28, 1857, Jacob andLaura Ruckelalso mortgaged to Lincoln, for $500, four lots of land that Jacob had acquired from\n                  his brother’s estate. They agreed to repay this mortgage, plus ten percent interest\n                  for the year, within one year. This mortgage was extended, but eventually paid in\n                  full.Illinois, U.S., Wills and Probate Records, 1772-1999, 17 April 1854, Sangamon County\n                     (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com, 2015);Mortgage Deed from Jacob Ruckel and Laura Ruckel to Abraham Lincoln, Promissory Note\n                        from Jacob Ruckel to Abraham Lincoln; Harry E.
