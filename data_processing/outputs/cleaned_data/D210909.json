        "text": "5Briggs is referring to the Illinois local elections of 1858 as well as their bearing\n                  on the1858 Federal Election. Abraham Lincoln was the Illinois Republican Party’s candidate for the U.S. Senate.\n                  He was running againstDemocraticincumbent Stephen A. Douglas. Members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time;\n                  therefore the outcome of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the senate seat. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C. Guelzo, “Houses\n                     Divided: Lincoln, Douglas, and the Political Landscape of 1858,”The Journal of American History94 (September 2007), 392-94."

        "text": "6This is a reference to Douglas’s stance with regard to theLecompton Constitution. In December 1857, Douglas spoke out against the Lecompton Constitution and criticized\n                  PresidentJames Buchananfor supporting it. This caused a rift in the Democratic Party, splitting it into\n                  pro-Douglas and pro-Buchanan camps. Some Republicans were excited by Douglas’s repudiation\n                  of the Lecompton Constitution to the extent that they considered supporting his reelection\n                  to the U.S. Senate. Although he later denied it, for a time Douglas actively courted\n                  political support from Republicans.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445-48."

        "text": "8If Lincoln replied to this letter, his response has not been located.During the first and secondLincoln-Douglas Debates, Douglas labeled Chase an abolitionist. In addition, both he and Lincoln discussed\n                  Chase’s proposed amendment to theKansas-Nebraska billin the U.S. Senate in 1854, in which Chase had moved that the people of theKansas Territorybe given the power to exclude slavery if they so chose. Senators rejected Chase’s\n                  amendment at the time by a vote of 10 in favor to 36 opposed. In the third, fourth,\n                  and seventh debates, which took place after this letter, Douglas repeated his claim\n                  that Chase was an abolitionist. Lincoln never directly confronted Douglas on the topic.Ultimately, in Illinois’s local elections, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate.  Through the campaign, however,\n                  and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln\n                  gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.First Debate with Stephen A.
