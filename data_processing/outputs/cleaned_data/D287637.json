        "text": "2Brewer references a lawsuit involving James Kelly andJesse D. Blackledge.  In August 1838, Kelly sold his share of a mill in Columbiana County, Ohio, to Nathan\n                  Harris, who financed the transaction with a series of promissory notes, with Blackledge\n                  as security.  Harris and Blackledge did not redeem the notes upon their maturity,\n                  and in August 1845, Kelly brought suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Columbiana\n                  County to recover the debt.  In June 1847, the court rendered a judgment against Blackledge\n                  and Harris for $632.59.  Blackledge failed to satisfy the judgment and moved toLogan County, Illinois.  Brewer, Kelly’s attorney inOhio, traced Blackledge to Logan County.  In October 1852, Kelly retainedLincoln & Herndonand sued Blackledge in theLogan County Circuit Courtto recover the debt. While the case proceeded in the Logan County Circuit Court,\n                  Blackledge died, and Kelly dismissed the case in order to file a claim against Blackledge’s\n                  estate.  Kelly continued to employ Lincoln & Herndon, and in 1854, he filed a claim\n                  againstDavid G. Evans, the executor of Blackledge's estate, in the Logan County Court.  In April 1855,\n                  the court refused the claim because Kelly had not filed the claim in time.  In September\n                  1855, Kelly appealed the judgment to the Logan County Circuit Court.  The September\n                  term of the court began on September 3, 1855.  The court ruled for Kelly and awarded\n                  him the judgment award from Ohio.Lincoln and Brewer firstcorrespondedregarding this suit in November 1852.  In 1855, Lincoln wrote Brewer three additional\n                  letters about this case.“An Act to Reduce the Limits of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, and to Fix the Times\n                     of Holding Courts Therein,” 3 February 1853,General Laws of Illinois(1853),      64; Henry C.
