    "full_text": "An Original Jackson Man to the Editors of The Old Soldier, 2 March 1840 Clear the way—again! Let the Old Soldiers andJacksonmen speak. We like to hear them. Let them come! There is honesty in their words,\n\npatriotism in their hearts, and conviction in their arguments. I have seen and read with great interest the two firstnumbers of your paper. Like the old soldier, whose name it bears,truth,honesty, andpatriotism, are its leading characteristics. I see in it that the old soldiers and Jackson men are contributing to its pages,\n\nand testifying, from personal observations, to the character, services, and patriotism\n\nofGeneral Harrison. Like them I saw some service in the late war, and like them I was the friend ofGeneral Jackson, and honestly aided in making him twice the President. Like them, however, I cannot\n\nclaim the honor of having battled atTippecanoe, at theThames, nor atNew Orleans, where victory rewarded their gallantry, but I can say that I was at the melancholy\n\ncontest of theRiver Raisin, and I now bear in my body theleaden that sanguinary engagement. Some have censured . . . having reinforced G. . . occasion. I cannot . . .\n\n. . .\n\nmen. . . shed at that massa. . . Raisin was unknow . . . contrary to his orders. . . . contemplated a movement . . . he did all in his power to aid us; but the , the roads, and the distance he was from us,being one hundred and fifteen miles, rendered it impossible. The battle was fought on the morning of the 22d of January, 1813. On the night of\n\nthe 16th, Gen. Harrison, then atUpper Sandusky, learned that “Gen. Winchestermeditated someunknownmovement against the enemy.” On the morning on the 17th he mounted his horse and\n\nwith his aid, Major Haskill, rode forty miles through the snow and the swamps toLower Sanduskyin seven hours and a half. A battalion was dispatched on the morning of the 18th,\n\nbut it was not until the morning of the 19th that he heard Col. Lewis had been sent with a detachment to the River Raisin, distant from Lower Sandusky\n\n75 miles. Fearing there was danger in this movement, Gen. Harrison immediately started\n\na regiment, with orders to make forced marches to his assistance, and immediately\n\nmounted his horse, and determined to go in advance of the regiment to the rapids on\n\ntheMaumee, where he expected to find Gen. Winchester. He reached the rapids, a distance of\n\n38 or 40 miles, on the morning of the 20th; but to his astonishment Gen. Winchester\n\nhad left, on the day before with a large portion of his force for the River Raisin,\n\n36 or 38 miles ahead. Gen. Harrison could do nothing more until the regiment he had\n\npreceded, should arrive. The insufficiency of the ice, the swamps and the roads delayed\n\nthe regiment and it did not come in time to prevent or to share the fatal catastrophe.\n\nHe did all he could to save us—mortal man could not have done more. Gen. Winchester\n\nhad been ordered to occupy the Rapids and to prepare for a march uponMalden. His movement to the River Raisin was unauthorized and unknown. Gen. Harrison,\n\nhowever, knew the chivalry of his men, and their great desire to do fighting before\n\nthey were disbanded, and feared they would go rashly into an engagement. The result\n\nproved the correctness of his fears. No man but a general would have anticipated such\n\na result, and no man but a General, enterprizing and brave, under the circumstances would have attempted to avert it.1 Like the Old Soldiers above referred to, I have known Gen. Harrison long, and well,\n\nin war and peace, in private and in public life. I believe him to possess the Jeffersonianquisites for office,Honesty and Capability.— believed the same of Gen. Jackson and therfore supported him for the Presidency. I haalso other reasons for supporting him; some owhich I will name: 1st. I believed the country nachange; the offices a thorough examinatand thextravagant and dishonest officersemoved. 2d. I believed if Gen. Jackson were elected, we should have a plain, honest and economical\n\nadministration—that he would not be the President of aParty, but of theAmerican People. 3d. I believed inone Presidential term, and so did he, as is shown by his declarations at the time, and his messages since. 4th. I believed in a strict accountability of the Public officers, and that they\n\nshould not use their offices for political or selfish purposes. 5th. I believed in a Western man as President, who knew our wants and interests to\n\na proper extent, and would have the honesty and firmness to servethem. 6th. I believed that Mr.Adamswho was then in power was rather in favor of asplendid Government, was disposed to extravagant expenditures, and was, in no respect, that plain, simpleLog Cabinpatriot like Gen. Jackson. In some respects, I must confess, I was disappointed in the Administration of Gen.\n\nJackson. But a powerful and talented party were arrayed against him; my feelings\n\nstrongly enlisted in his favor, and I was disposed to overlook his partizan acts.\n\nI believed in the honest patriotism of the man, and I was disposed to forget, and\n\nforgive, where I could not approve; and under these feelings I supported him for asecond termcontrary to principle. Mr.Van Burenhas none of the qualities to sustain him that I admired in Gen. Jackson.—He is a\n\nsecond John Quincy Adams, with more aristocratic feelings, and much less honesty.\n\nI have examined his whole history, and I cannot find in it the time or the place he\n\nrendered services to his country, or ever did a noble, disinterested act. He seems\n\nnever to have been governed by any fixed principles, butself-preservationandself-aggrandizement. He has watched closely the rise of political parties;—but has been most unfortunate\n\nin his selection ofsidesin the beginning; has always changed from theweakto thestrongside, when it was possible, and has often profited by the change. In 1812 he opposed\n\nthe war, voted for the federal anti-war candidate, against Mr.Madisonthe republican war candidate, but when Harrison,Scott,Renselaer, Brown and Jackson, had nearly fought it through, he became full of fight—in words.2 In 1819, he opposed the admission ofMisriinto the Union as a slave State, and . . .edfree negroes to vote in his own3. . . .w “uncompromising” in his hostili. . .ion and is “the northern man wit. . .etings. hen theNew York canalwas project. . .mmortalClintonand was unpopular,hew. . .inst it. In a few yearsitbecame popular, andhebecame its friend. In1824he was against Gen. Jackson; and through ’25 and ’26 he supported the administration of Mr. Adams, and wishedoffice under him. He failed to get it. In 1827heand Mr.Cambrelengtook a trip all through the South. He could not fail to see that Gen. Jackson must\n\nbe elected. On his return home hecutMr. Adams, and became the supporter of General Jackson. In 1827 or ’28 he was opposed to grantingpre-emption rightsto the poor settlers on our western lands; now to gain a few votes for asecond termhe recommends them in his messages. I could enumeratea dozenother changes—his whole life is one ofturningsandtwistingsfor self interest; and although he has been long in public life he never originated\n\nor advocated with ability agreat measure. I will now drop thesycophant, and take up the patriot and soldier. Gen. Harrison professes very much the same\n\nprinciples that General Jackson did. Forty years of public service, in war and in\n\npeace, have proved him honest. TheMagician’s charm is broken—the country calls for achange—and in thatchangeit cannot be worsted. Gen. Harrison believes in a plain, economical and democratic\n\nadministration; inone Presidential term;a strictaccountabilityofpublic officers;is againstproscriptionforpolitical opinions;is awestern manin feeling and residence. Then why may not the old Jackson men, who are true to\n\nthe principles we profess, go in for him? It is consistent and proper for them to\n\ndo so; and I shall, as surely as I live.",

Van Buren immediately abandoned Clinton\n                  after his loss, causing the two to become bitter rivals for control of theDemocratic-Republican partyinNew York.Van Buren’s opponents after the War of 1812 regularly condemned him for his reluctance\n                  to join the fighting--he turned down the offer of a military commission--and for not\n                  doing enough in theNew York Senateto support the war effort.  In point of fact, Van Buren was a War Hawk who crafted\n                  and shepherd through many piece of war legislation, included the raising of troops.\n                  In September 1814, he authored a radical measure allowing the governor to conscript\n                  12,000 men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five to defend the state.

A battalion was dispatched on the morning of the 18th,\n               but it was not until the morning of the 19th that he heard Col.

Harrison,\n               however, knew the chivalry of his men, and their great desire to do fighting before\n               they were disbanded, and feared they would go rashly into an engagement.  The result\n               proved the correctness of his fears. No man but a general would have anticipated such\n               a result, and no man but a General, enterprizing and brave, under the circumstances would have attempted to avert it.1"
