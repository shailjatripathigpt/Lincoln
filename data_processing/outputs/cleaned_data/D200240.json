        "text": "2In January 1835, the General Assembly passed anactdefining the duties of the public printer, fixing the time and manner of performing\n                  printing for the state, setting prices for various publications, and establishing\n                  a procedure for choosing a public printer.   Section one stipulated that the House\n                  of Representatives andSenatewould select the public printer by joint ballot at the beginning of each session.\n                  As party divisions solidified and hardened, partisanship came to the fore in these\n                  elections, enabling the majority party to hold sway in these contests.  During Lincoln’s\n                  time in the House, the public printers wereJohn Y. Sawyer(1835-36), founder, editor, and publisher of the solidlyDemocratic-RepublicanIllinois Advocate; andWilliam Walters(1837-1841), editor and publisher of theIllinois State Register, successor of the Advocate and also  stronglyDemocratic.  Lincoln voted for other candidates in each of the four elections in which he cast\n                  a ballot.  He had  particular animus toward Walters and clamored to replace him, as\n                  evidenced by his impassionedlettertoAndrew McCormickin January 1839, in which he castigated McCormick for voting for Walters.  Lincoln\n                  proposed this resolution in part to embarrass Walters and help his friendSimeon Francis, editor of theWhig-leaningSangamo Journal, in the upcoming election for public printer.There was also growing dissatisfaction in the House over the cost associated with\n                  public printing, particularly during straitened economic conditions accompanying thePanic of 1837.   In defending his resolution, Lincoln cited GovernorDavid Wallace’s message  of December 8, 1840, to theIndiana General Assemblywhere he bemoaned the “heavy and unnecessary” expenditure of $12,457.81  for public\n                  printing.Illinois, on the other hand, with half the population, had expended $23,000 for the same service\n                  over a similar time period.This exorbitant cost prompted some to question the method of choosing the public\n                  printer and contracting for public printing.  On December 16, 1840, the House adopted\n                  a resolution instructing the Committee on Public Accounts and Expenditures to investigate\n                  the feasibility of scrapping the current system and creating a competitive bidding\n                  process for public printing, with the lowest bid receiving the contract.Franklin W.
