Lincoln et al.In the case,Edward OldhamandThomas Hemingway, the surviving partners ofOldham, Todd and Company, which includedRobert S. Todd, father ofMary Lincoln, claimed that the company had hired Lincoln and Edwards to collect some debts for\n                  them inIllinois.  Oldham and Hemingway claimed that Lincoln, Edwards, and Kinkead (who was acting\n                  as Lincoln's attorney in Lexington, Kentucky) failed to pay them $472.54.  In June\n                  1853, Oldham and Hemingway sued Lincoln and others in a chancery action to recover\n                  the debt.  Lincoln denied the charges and claimed that Robert S. Todd had asked him\n                  to collect two debts in Illinois and told Lincoln that he could keep the proceeds.\n                  Lincoln collected $50 from one of the debts and none from the other.  In February\n                  1854, after depositions Lincoln took supported his version of events, Oldham and Hemingway\n                  dismissed the case.Lincoln wrote Kinkead at least three more letters in 1853 and one in 1854 related\n                  to this case.Oldham & Hemingway v.
