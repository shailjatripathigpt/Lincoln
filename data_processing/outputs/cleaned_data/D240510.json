        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote the list in its entirety.The list is undated, but editors investigating Lincoln’s legal cases discovered that\n                  one William Chauncy Langdon served as a witness inRugg v. Haines.  Langdon gave a deposition  in the case on December 20, 1856, and he would have\n                  been reimbursed for his time and travel.  Robert Allen died in 1854, and his estate\n                  was finally settled in May 1857.  Based on this fact, the editor dated the document\n                  sometime in 1856 or 1857.Daniel W.
