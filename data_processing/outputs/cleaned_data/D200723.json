        "text": "3Article six of the Illinois State Constitution of 1848 dealt with elections and the\n                  rights of suffrage.  The framers did not include provisions for naturalized citizens.\n                  The election law of 1849, enacted by theIllinois General Assemblyon February 12, provided for the method for voting by ballot and for the manner in\n                  which ballots were returned, collected, canvassed, and verified.  Section ten prescribed\n                  the qualification for voters and the oath required of voters if election judges suspected\n                  a person was not a qualified voter.  This law specifically repealed sections one,\n                  fifteen, eighteen, twenty-four, and thirty-nine, of chapter thirty-seven of the revised\n                  statutes, entitled “Elections,” enacted on March 3, 1845.  It retained section nineteen\n                  of chapter thirty-seven, which required election judges to  receive the vote of anyone\n                  taking the oath or affirmation, unless evidence convinced a majority of the judges\n                  in a precinct that the oath or affirmation was false; then the judges could reject\n                  the vote, and charge the perpetrator with perjury.  Judges could also reject the votes\n                  of those who refused to take the oath.Section eighteen of the revised statutes gave the right of suffrage to all white men\n                  twenty-one years or older having resided in Illinois six months preceding an election,\n                  regardless whether they had been naturalized or not.  The General Assembly in the\n                  election law of 1849 repealed this section, and in section ten of the new law changed\n                  the qualification for suffrage to all white men twenty-one years of age or older having\n                  resided in Illinois one year preceding an election, or all white men over the age\n                  of twenty-one who resided in the state on April 1, 1848--the date the State Constitution\n                  of 1848 went into effect.In the preamble to the letter, editors of theIllinois Daily Journalinsisted, in light of the opinion, that having naturalization papers at the polls\n                  was “not indispensably necessary,” but advised “our friends among the adopted citizens\n                  to take their papers with them, as the shortest and easiest way of doing the thing\n                  up, in case of a controversy.”Neither theIllinois Daily Journalnor theIllinois State Registerreported voter repression or electoral irregularities on election day.  TheIllinois State Registernoted that election day passed quietly in Springfield, except for a “few fights.”A bastion for the Whig Party, Sangamon County gave Whig candidates majorities in thefederal, state, and local elections.  In the presidential election,Winfield Scott, candidate of the Whig Party, received 56.6% of the vote andFranklin Pierce, candidate of theDemocratic Party, 42.8%.  Pierce carriedIllinois, however, with 51.87% of the vote to Scott’s 41.77 %.  In the governor’s race, Whig\n                  candidateEdwin B. Webbreceived 56.4% of the vote to 43% for Democratic candidateJoel A. Mattesonin the county, but Matteson won the statewide contest with 52.39% of the vote to\n                  Webb’s 41.76%.Richard Yates, the Whig incumbent in the Illinois Sixth Congressional District, won reelection\n                  with 51.09% of the vote, with Sangamon County giving him 60.6% of its vote to 39.4%\n                  forJohn Calhoun, his Democratic opponent.  The entire slate of Whig candidates in Sangamon County\n                  elections received similar majorities.Ill. Const. of 1848, art. VI, § 1-8; “An Act to Provide for the Mode of Voting by\n                     Ballot, and for the Manner of Returning, Canvassing and Certifying Votes,” 12 February\n                     1849,Laws of Illinois(1849), 71-75; “Chapter XXXVII: Elections,” 3 March 1845,Revised Statutes of Illinois(1845),      213-24;Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 2 November 1852, 2:4;Illinois State Register(Springfield), 1 November 1852, 2:3; 4 November 1852, 2:1; Howard W.
