Van Buren received 28.4 percent,\n                  running ahead of Cass, who got 26.2 percent.In New England as a whole, Taylor won inConnecticut,Rhode Island, andVermont, with Cass winning inMaineandNew Hampshire.  Taylor only received an absolute majority, however, in Rhode Island, and Cass only\n                  in New Hampshire.  The Free Soil Party made significant inroads in their respective\n                  majorities, indicating the growing influence of anti-slavery rhetoric in the region.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:280-84;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 9 September 1848,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1848-09-09; 12 September 1848,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1848-09-12; William F.
