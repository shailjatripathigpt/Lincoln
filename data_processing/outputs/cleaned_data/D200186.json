The meeting was called to order by Col.R. B. Servant, ofRandolph county, and, on his motion,Cyrus Edwards, Esq., ofMadison county, was chosen President, andJames B. Moore&H. I. Mills, Esqs. were chosen Vice Presidents; and, on the further motion of Col. Servant,B. Bond, Esq., ofClinton county, andJ. H. Murphy, Esq., ofVermilion county, were chosen Secretaries—when, on motion ofJ. J. Hardin, Esq., ofMorgan county, thePresidentappointed Messrs. J. J. Hardin,Joseph Gillespie,O. H. Browning,Cyrus Walkerand R. B. Servant, a committee to prepare resolutions expressive of the object and\n\nviews of this meeting; which said committee retired for said purpose. Mr.Lincoln, ofSangamon county, then offered for adoption the following preamble and resolutions, viz: Whereas, the Van Buren State Convention, which adjourned on the 10th inst., passed various resolutions denouncing Whig individuals, Whig policy, and the Whig\n\nparty in general.—1 Therefore. Resolved, That every member of that Convention, who introduced any such resolution or resolutions,\n\nor any amendment thereto, be respectfully requested to bring the same, or a correct\n\ncopy thereof, into this Hall, and to attempt to sustain it by facts and arguments. Resolved, That on the discussion of said resolutions, we will meet their authors, man for\n\nman, and speech for speech, in order that the public may see with whom are the facts,\n\nand with whom the arguments. Resolved, That for the purpose of discussing said resolutions, we will meet their auths on to-morrow evening, at 7 o’clock, P.M.this Hall, or at any other time and place2may better suit their convenience; which sapreamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted. When, J. J. Hardin, Esq., from the committee appointed to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of the\n\nmeeting, reported the following, viz: Whereas, the time is fast hastening, when a proper organization of the Whig party,\n\n(opposed to the administration ofMartin Van Buren, and the ruinous policy advocated by him and his friends,) will be necessary to save\n\nthe country and the Constitution from impending ruin; and whereas, the presentpartyin power, have adopted the appellation of “Democrat,” for the purpose of misleading the honest portion of the people, while they are\n\ncontinually practising upon the principle of the oldFederalparty; and whereas, the said party are in the habit, like their leader, Martin Van Buren,\n\nof advocating or denouncing any measure, as it may suit their immediate interest. And whereas, the said party have, contrary to the sentiment ofJeffersonand all other truly democratic leaders of former times, enlisted in their cause,\n\nthe active energies of all the Federal officers in the nation, who hold their offices\n\nupon the tenure of carrying out the views and behests of their Patron andPresident;3therefore, it becomes highly necessary, in order to effectuate the overthrow of said\n\nparty, to adopt a system and policy, which will enable the real friends of the country\n\nto act in concert. Therefore, Resolved, That we recommend that a Convention of the Whig Young Men of Illinois, be held in\n\nSpringfield on Wednesday after the second Monday of June next, for the purpose of\n\nmore effectually organizing the Whig party—4 Resolved, That the State Bank System was adopted in some of the States of the Union, and was\n\ngreatly enlarged in others, for the purpose of carrying out the experiment of Gen.Jacksonand his administration—to improve the currency, and to put down theUnited States Bank; and that theState Bank of Illinoiswas advocated and created by an administration Legislature for the purpose of carrying\n\nout the experiment of the presentLocofoco party.5 Resolved, That the attempt of the Locofocos, to throw off their paternity of the State Bank\n\nof Illinois, comes with an ill grace from that party, after they have created that\n\nBank; and that we utterly repudiate the charge that the Whig party are responsible\n\nfor its creation or management.6 Resolved, That we are opposed to the creation of so large a debt, as it is now discovered,\n\nwould be entailed on the State by carrying out theInternal Improvement system, as contemplated by law; and that we believe that system needs classification, curtailment\n\nor suspension.7 Resolved, That we look with feelings of indignation and sorrow upon the attempts of\n\nmisguided political fanatics, and of dishonest political partisans, to render the\n\ndecisions of the Judges of theSupreme Courtobnoxious to the people, by unwarrantably ascribing their decisions to party or political\n\nmotives, without reason, when such decisions are upon points on which the greatest,\n\nwisest and best men of the country honestly differ—which attempts are calculated to\n\nlower the character and dignity of the court, and intended to make it subservient\n\nto party purposes. Resolved, That we deny explicitly the charge of desiring to make the Secretary of\n\nState an officer for life; that we recognise the Supreme Court, the highest judicial tribunal of the State, as the proper authority\n\nto determine, under the existing Constitution and laws, the power of the Governor\n\nto remove that officer; and that we assert the right of theLegislatureto limit the tenure of the said office, by law, whenever it shall think proper so\n\nto do.8 Resolved, That the wasteful expenditures of the people’s money, and the unexampled\n\nincrease of offices and officers, under Mr. Van Buren’s administration, are incontrovertible\n\nevidences of the mal-administration of the General Government by the party in power,\n\nand call loudly upon every friend of his country to aid in reforming the administration,\n\nand curtailing its expenditures. Resolved, That theSub-treasurysystemas advocated by the administration party, in the language of theGlobe, is “disorganising, revolutionary and subversive of the fundamental principles of the Constitution,\n\nand tends to unite the purse and the sword in the hands of the Executive, and exposes\n\nthe Treasury to be plundered by a hnndred hands, where before one could not touch it.”9 Resolved, That the imbecility of the present administration is fully manifest from the fact,\n\nthat whilst the administration of the democrats, underMadison, carried on awarby land and sea with the most powerful nation on the globe, for three years, at an\n\nexpense of seventy millions, which covered ourarmyandnavywith glory, and the administration with the gratitude of the nation; yet this mis-named\n\ndemocratic administration has carried on athree years warwith a handful ofFlorida Indians; at an expense of ten millions of dollars, which has resulted in the disgrace of\n\nour army, the violation of our national honor, and the abandonment of all SouthFloridato less than a thousand Indian warriors. Resolved, That the attempts of the party in power, to regulate the currency and afford a gold\n\nand silver circulation, are on a perfect par with their efforts to regulate the Florida\n\nIndians—attended, in every instance, withdisaster,defeatanddisgrace. Resolved, That the Sub-treasury system is the best, safest and most ingenious method ever\n\nyet devised, for effecting that which seems to be one of the chief aims of the sub-treasurers\n\nof this administration, that is, robbing the people of their money, filling their\n\nown bottomless pockets, and giving leg bail for pay.10 Resolved, That, although we have no doubt that the penitentiary section of theSub-treasuryBill ought to be enforced on hundreds of the leg treasurers of this administration,11yet, in the experience of the past, we see an assurance for the future, that every\n\nfacility will be afford- them for avoiding their just punishment, by toTexas, or Swart-outing toFrance;12wch were severally unanimously adopted. After which, able speeches were made by Messrs. Browning,BakerandField. Col. Field, not being able to conclude his speech on this evening, gave way for an adjournment,\n\nso as to conclude at the next meeting. Before adjournment, Col. A. P. Field moved that thePresidentappoint a committee of ten to prepare an address to the people of the State; which\n\nmotion was agreed to. Whereupon, theChairappointed the following named gentlemen: A. P. Field, O. H. Browning, J. J. Hardin, R. B. Servnnt,S. H. Little,Wm. Fithian,A. G. Henry,A. Williams, A. Lincoln andE. B. Webb, Esqrs., said committee. When, The meeting adjourned to meet on to-morrow evening at 6 o’clock. The meeting met adjournment. The meeting beed to order by the Chair, Col Field proceeded to conclude his speech; after which, the following resolution was\n\nunanimously adopted, viz: Resolved, That a committee of 3 Whigs, be appointed by the Chair, to meet as many Democrats\n\nto appoint officers for a general meeting—of citizens to take place to-morrow evening, and to make such other arrangements as may be proper for a fair and impartial\n\ndebate, on the principles upon which the two great political parties differ.13 In pursuance of which, the Chair appointed Messrs. Hardin, Browning and Baker, said committee. On motion of Col. R. B. Servant, the following resolution was unanimously adopted, viz: Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be signed by thePresident, Vice Presidents and Secretaries, and that theJouanaland all other Whig papers in the State, theMissouri Republican,St. Louis BulletinandLouisville Journal, be requested to publish the proceedings of this meeting. And then the meeting adjourned.",

In hisannual messageto the General Assembly in December 1838, GovernorThomas Carlinvoiced his support for the system, though he would have recommended its adoption\n                  on a lesser scale, with emphasis on constructing the most important works. Carlin\n                  suggested the General Assembly consider “modification” that would render the system\n                  “more useful and better suited to the conditions” of the state, leading theSangamo Journalto wonder if by “modification” the governor meant “curtailment or classification.”\n                  Classification in this context might have meant differentiating between important\n                  and lesser projects and concentrating first on the former instead of pursuing all\n                  of the provisions of theinternal improvement actat the same time. Whatever course the General Assembly pursued, Carlin recommended\n                  “a rigid economy” in spending state funds. The General Assembly ignored his advice,\n                  increasing the size and expense of the system. Carlin repeated the call for modification\n                  in hisannual messageof December 1839.John H. Krenkel,Illinois Internal Improvements 1818-1848(Cedar Rapids, IA: Torch, 1958), 153-54;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL),  5 January 1839, 2:2."

        "text": "8This resolution and the one preceding it related to two legal cases attracting much\n                  public interest.  The first involved a controversy over the office of secretary of\n                  state.  In January 1839, newly-elected Governor Thomas Carlin nominatedJohn A. McClernand, a political ally, to replaceAlexander P. Field, the incumbent since 1829.  TheIllinois Senaterefused to confirm McClernand’s nomination, arguing  that the Illinois Constitution\n                  did not give the governor power to nominate someone as secretary of state unless there\n                  was a vacancy, and the Senate had not been informed of a vacancy,    as Field still\n                  occupied the office.   The legislative session ended in March, and in April Carlin,\n                  acting by virtue of his authority as governor,  appointed McClernand secretary of\n                  state in place of Field, and McClernand demanded that Field give up the office and\n                  records and papers belonging to the same.  Field refused to vacate the office, and\n                  the attorney general filed suit against Field in theFayette County Circuit Court, arguing that Field was unlawfully occupying and exercising the office, and that\n                  McClernand was the lawful secretary of state.  The court ruled in favor of McClernand,\n                  and Field appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court.This controversy evolved as the state capital was being transferred fromVandalia, Illinois, toSpringfield, Illinois.  To safeguard the records of his office, Field stored them withRobertandJohn Irwin. In July, McClernand suedRobert Irwin & Companyin theSangamon County Circuit Courtfor the recovery of the records.   Robert Irwin & Company retainedAbraham Lincoln, andStephen A. Douglasrepresented McClernand.  The court quashed McClernand’s action, and on July 22, the\n                  Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Fayette County Circuit Court.  Shortly\n                  thereafter, a handbill attributed to McClernand appeared denouncing the Supreme Court\n                  for its decision.  Among the charges was the intention to make Field secretary of\n                  state for life.  This case created such controversy that the General Assembly sought\n                  to enact legislation to define the tenure of the office of secretary of state.  The\n                  Senate passed, but the House rejected, such abillin January 1840.The second case wasThomas Spragins v. Horace H. Houghton, better known as the “Galena Alien Case.”  Argued before the Jo Daviess County Circuit\n                  Court in its May 1839 term, the suit was brought to test the rights of aliens to vote,\n                  with  the hope of getting a Supreme Court decision on the matter.Daniel Stone, presiding judge of the Sixth Circuit, ruled that  aliens were not entitled to exercise\n                  the elective franchise.  As expected, Spragins, an election judge sued for allowing\n                  a  unnaturalized Irish immigrant to vote in the state elections of August 1838, appealed\n                  to the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in its December 1839 term.  Clerical errors\n                  in the record caused a continuance until the December 1840 term, after thepresidential election. When finally decided, the court reversed the lower court’s ruling, according aliens\n                  voting rights under current law.  Both these cases generated criticism of the Supreme\n                  Court, and in 1841, the General Assembly passed anactreorganizing it.Illinois SenateJournal. 1838. 11th G.
