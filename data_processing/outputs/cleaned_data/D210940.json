        "text": "3Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas were competing for a seat in theU.S. Senate.Winter is discussing preparations for the fifthLincoln-Douglas Debate, to be held in Galesburg on October 7, 1858. Despite Winter’s statement here that\n                  Douglas was expected in Galesburg on the evening before the debate, Douglas reportedly\n                  arrived by train in Galesburg at 10:00 am on October 7 and was greeted by his supporters\n                  and local military organizations. The ceremony welcoming Douglas to Galesburg included\n                  speeches and the presentation of banners. Lincoln reportedly left Peoria by train\n                  on the evening of October 6 and seems to have disembarked in Knoxville as Winter proposed.\n                  On the morning of October 7 a procession of citizens of Galesburg, including one hundred\n                  men and women on horseback, traveled out of Galesburg on the Knoxville road in order\n                  to meet Lincoln and escort him into the city. Lincoln arrived in Galesburg in a procession\n                  that was allegedly “long enough, taken all together, to reach around the town and\n                  tie in a bow-knot.” The procession marched around town with banners, concluding with\n                  a ceremony at the home of Lincoln’s host, Henry R. Sanderson, during which Lincoln\n                  was also presented with banners.According to the RepublicanChicago Tribune, among the processions arriving in Galesburg on the morning of October 7, a “decided\n                  preponderance” carried banners supporting Lincoln and Kellogg. TheChicago Times, a Democratic organ, claimed in contrast that Lincoln’s procession into Galesburg\n                  was a third the size of Douglas’, and further stated that Democrats outnumbered Republicans\n                  nearly two to one at the Lincoln-Douglas Debate there. TheChicago Timesstated that the Republican committee of arrangements for the Lincoln-Douglas Debate\n                  in Galesburg had been writing letters to Republican leaders in the surrounding area\n                  as early as September 13, 1858 in an attempt to encourage a strong Republican showing.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-58, 466;The Metamora Herald(IL), 21 August 1931, 9:2;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 7 October 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-10-07;The Daily Chicago Times(IL), 9 October 1858, 1:3-4;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 9 October 1858, 2:2;The Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 5 October 1899, 2:2; Franklin William Scott,Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, vol. 6 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1910), 59-60, 65."

Several days after the date of this\n                  letter, it was announced that rather than postponing his speech scheduled in Peoria\n                  for October 7, 1858, Trumbull would switch the date of that appearance with a speech\n                  he was scheduled to give inLaconon October 5, so that the residents of Peoria could attend the Lincoln-Douglas Debate\n                  in Galesburg on October 7. It was reported that a special train from Peoria consisting\n                  of twenty-two cars carried over two thousand people from Peoria to Galesburg for the\n                  debate.
