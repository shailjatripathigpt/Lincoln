None\n                  of Martin’s letters to Lincoln from this period are extant.  It appears that this\n                  involves a separate legal issue, as neither Lamb, McCormack, or the other individuals\n                  included in the presumed telegram text written by Martin on the verso of Lincoln’s\n                  July 19letterwere principals in the railroad cases.Martin continued to press Lincoln on the subject, and Lincoln investigated, relaying\n                  the results of his inquiry in aletterto  Martin  on July 31.  The final disposition of the case is unknown.Alton & Sangamon RR v. Barret, Martha L.
