        "text": "3Turner is referencing the recently concluded case ofKemper v. Adams & Bovey, in which he and Lincoln had served as attorneys for the defendants. The lawsuit\n                  stemmed from a judgment recovered byJohn H. KemperagainstWilliam F. Bradshaw, following which the marshal sold land owned by Bradshaw inOgle County, Illinoisto satisfy the judgment. Bradshaw, however, conveyed the land claimed by Kemper under\n                  the judgment to Adam Adams and John Bovey. Kemper, represented byStephen T. Logan, sued Adams and Bovey in an action of ejectment in theU.S. Circuit Court for the District of Illinoisto remove them from the property. Adams and Bovey contended that the time during\n                  which Kemper could sue had expired. The court found in favor of Kemper and Adams and\n                  Bovey motioned for a new trial. The court granted the motion and a jury found for\n                  Kemper. Adams and Bovey apparently sued Kemper for an injunction to stop the execution\n                  of the judgment, and in March 1858, theU.S. Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinoisruled for Adams and Bovey.As indicated in an earlierletterfrom Lincoln to Turner, Lincoln first became involved in the lawsuit in December\n                  1849. He wrote multiple letters to the parties involved in this case prior to its\n                  conclusion in 1858. For the letters related to this case, seeKemper v. Adams & Bovey, Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition, 2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),http://www.lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Details.aspx?case=140935."

At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.
