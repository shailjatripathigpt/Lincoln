Douglas“considered it an intrusion” whenAbraham Lincolnappeared in a town on the day or evening of a Douglas meeting, a correspondent with\n                  theDemocraticIllinois State Registerwas “astonished” to learn that Lincoln was also speaking in Sullivan on September\n                  20.  Lincoln’s list of appointments as early as September 4, however, had included\n                  the stop at Sullivan, whereas Douglas’s list of appointments did not include a stop\n                  at Sullivan.Abraham Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to, Douglas, theDemocratincumbent. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Abraham Lincoln to Joseph T.

That morning, Douglas had traveled fromMattoonto Sullivan.Lincoln altered his speech time from 2 to 3 p.m. When Lincoln’s supporters escorted\n                  him to the rally, they interrupted Douglas’s speech. According to theIllinois State Register, Lincoln’s uncourteous behavior almost caused  a riot, but Douglas kept the audience\n                  calm and avoided the worst. TheDaily Illinois State Journaldisagreed with that assessment, calling the story false and created by Douglas’s\n                  friends to divert any negative attention away him.Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 23 September 1858, 2:3-5;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 27 September 1858, 2:1;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 20 September 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-20."
