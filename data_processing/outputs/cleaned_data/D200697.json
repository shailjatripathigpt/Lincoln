If her deceased husband had no children,\n                  the widow received outright ownership of one-half of the estate.InSarah Lincoln’s case, since Lincoln was his father’s sole heir, she was due one-third of the land\n                  that her husband,Thomas Lincoln, had owned during their marriage. In adeeddated August 12, 1851, Abraham andMary Lincolngifted John D. Johnston the land which Lincoln had inherited from his father. However,\n                  Sarah Lincoln’s right of dower passed along with this transfer of property, meaning\n                  that the land Abraham and Mary Lincoln gifted Johnston in the deed was still subject\n                  to her right of dower. She remained entitled to one-third of the land that Thomas\n                  Lincoln had owned during their marriage.“Dower,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
