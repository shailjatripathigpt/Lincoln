        "text": "2The case ofPowell v. Ament & Beerinvolved a dispute over the ownership of land in Adams County, Illinois. The case\n                  had commenced in theU.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinoisin January 1858, with Abraham Lincoln as an attorney for the plaintiff. At issue\n                  in the case was title to property which had originally been military bounty land patented\n                  byJabez Morseand whichJeremiah Evartsclaimed to have purchased from Morse, apparently through land agentsMoore, Morton & Company. Although Lloyd’s nephew,Lloyd Powell, was the plaintiff of record on the case, Lloyd seems to have owned the land in question\n                  at one time. No correspondence between Lincoln and Powell has been located, but Lloyd\n                  wrote Lincoln several letters regarding the case and assisted in gathering documentation\n                  for Powell’s claim.On June 24, 1858, the case had been submitted for trial by judge, withNorman H. Purpleappearing for the plaintiff. After hearing the evidence, JudgeSamuel H. Treatdeclined to rule immediately and instead decided to take time to consider the matter.\n                  Judgment was not issued until January 12, 1859, when the court ruled for the defendants.\n                  The case went through two more trials and was ultimately decided in favor of Powell\n                  in 1863. Lincoln’s involvement in the case ended about 1860.Judge’s Docket, Document ID: 64426; Order, Document ID: 64425; Judgment Docket, Document\n                     ID: 64429,Powell v.
