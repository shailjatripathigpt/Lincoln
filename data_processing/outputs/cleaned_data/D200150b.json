Thorntonin the chair.Mr. Ewingtook the floor and moved to strike out all after the enacting clause of the bill,\n\nand insert an amendment, providing thatVandaliashall be the seat of Government until otherwise ordered. Mr. Ewing said that it was\n\nunconstitutional to legislate upon the subject till 1840, and that when the bill passed\n\nlocating the seat of government atSpringfield, it was supposed that fifty thousand dollars would cover all the expenses of erecting\n\npublic buildings. It seemed that it would now require one hundred and twenty-eight\n\nthousand more. He then went into an examination of the fiscal concerns of theState, and declared that the State was now in debt six million and a half of dollars; and\n\nit was time members should pause and reflect in making appropriations. Mr.Lincolnsaid, he believed the majority would agree, that if the work was done at all, it\n\nshould be well done; and he was willing to submit the question to the House without\n\nsaying one word more. Mr. Ewing’s amendment was rejected.2 Mr. Ewing then proposed another amendment—that a Board of Commissioners should be\n\nappointed to locate the seat of government on vacant land; that they should lay out\n\nand sell the lots; and with the money build a State House. He thought that half a\n\nmillion might be realized by this measure.Mr. Bakerreplied that the gentleman in his former argument had stated that it was unconstitntional\n\nto legislate upon this subject till 1840.Mr. B.fully replied to Mr. Ewing’s remarks, at length.Mr. Ficklinfollowed, and endeavored to show that the State was not pledged to make the appropriation—that\n\nthe seat of government ought to remain at Vandalia—that the present capitol was good\n\nenough—and that the question of a location of the seat of government ought to be submitted\n\nto the people in 1840.—Mr. Lincoln said, that the people in 1840, would have no better\n\nright to decide the question, than the people of 1839. True, the Constitution had\n\nfixed the seat of government at Vandalia for twenty years, and if the people had made\n\na hard bargain, they had a right to get out of it the best way they could.3As to making money in locating state capitals, by selling lots, that matter could\n\nbe settled by ascertaining how many state capitols had been built by the sale of lots\n\nin Vandalia; the idea that money can be made in this way was all illusion. Mr. Ewing\n\nthen read a statement of the votes given by the people some years since in reference\n\nto the seat of government, by which it appeared that Vandalia had the second highest\n\nnumber.4He said that Springfield could not accommodate the Legislature better than Vandalia\n\nnow does, and would not probably for ten years to come. He wished to see Vandalia\n\nremain the seat of government until the interest of the country required its removal.\n\nMr. Ewing’s amendment was then rejected. Mr. Ewing submitted another amendment—that the location should be again submitted\n\nto the people—that if there should be no choice, to return to the people thefiveplaces having the highest number of votes; if there should be no choice out of these,\n\nthen thethreehighest should be submitted to be voted for the third time; if there then should\n\nbe no choice, the election to be made between thetwohighest returned. The amendment was rejected. The Committee then rose and reported\n\nprogress. Mr. Ficklin proposed an amendment, that the State should lend the corporation of\n\nSpringfield 128,000 dollars to complete the State House; and at the election in 1840\n\nto submit to the people whether Springfield should remain the seat of government;\n\nand, if not, to compel the corporation to reimburse the money thus loaned. An amendment\n\nwas offered to Mr. Ficklin’s amendment byMr. Carpenter; but both were rejected. The House adjourned.5",
