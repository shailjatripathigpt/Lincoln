        "text": "2Moses Loe was indicted in September 1852 for manslaughter for stabbing James Gray\n                  in the neck, instantly killing him. Loe retained Abraham Lincoln for his attorney\n                  and requested a change of venue fromSangamon Countyto DeWitt County, which was granted. Loe pleaded self-defense, arguing that he and\n                  Gray had planned to meet and fight with each other at the time and place where and\n                  when the killing afterwards occurred. Nevertheless, a jury found Loe guilty of manslaughter\n                  and sentenced him to eight years in theIllinois State Penitentiary. This petition was successful and Loe was pardoned and released from prison by Governor\n                  William H. Bissell on August 31, 1857.Indictment, Document ID: 121633; Affidavit for change of venue, Document ID: 54856;\n                     Affidavit, Document ID:  54855,People v. Loe, Martha L.
