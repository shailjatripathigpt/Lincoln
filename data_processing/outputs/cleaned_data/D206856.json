        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote and signed this letter.In newspaper stories on the donation of this letter to the University of Illinois\n                  at Urbana-Champaign in October 1960, university officials  said  the recipient of\n                  this letter wasJoseph Gundy, a farmer, livestock raiser, and legal client of Lincoln’s  fromDanville, Illinois.  Joseph Gundy had supposedly given Lincoln an unspecified amount of money in order\n                  for Lincoln to pay Gundy’s state taxes.  University officials suggested that the money\n                  Lincoln transmitted to Gundy was a refund for the overpayment of taxes.  Roy P. Basler,\n                  editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, retained Joseph Gundy as the recipient and the story about tax payment in the absence\n                  of other evidence.    Editors working with the Lincoln Legal Papers determined, however,\n                  that the recipient was more likely to beJacob Gundy, a veteran of theAmerican Revolutionwho sought Lincoln’s legal assistance in getting his pension payments three times\n                  in 1844 and 1845.  In his application for his semi-annual pension payment for March\n                  to September 1845, Jacob Gundy identified Lincoln  as his attorney who, in Gundy’s\n                  name, would receive Gundy’s pension payments from the pension agent in Springfield,\n                  Illinois.  On September 20, 1845, the pension agent affixed Lincoln’s name to a receipt\n                  for $21.66—the amount of Gundy’s pension for six months.  Gundy received an annual\n                  pension of $43.33.Chicago Daily News(IL), 13 October 1960, Metropolitan Section 1:1-3;Sunday Commercial-News(Danville, IL), 2 October 1960, 23:3; Roy P.
