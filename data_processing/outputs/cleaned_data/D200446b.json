After\n\ndiscontinuing the service, these petitioners, supposing they might have legal redress\n\nagainst Avery, brought suit against him inNew Orleans; in which suit they failed, on the ground that Avery had complied with his contract,\n\nhaving done so much towards the transfer as they had accepted and been satisfied with.\n\nStill later, the department sued Reeside on his supposed indebtedness, and by a verdict\n\nof the jury it was determined that the department was indebted to him in a sum much\n\nbeyond all the credits given him on the account above stated. Under these circumstances,\n\nthe committee consider the petitioners clearly entitled to relief, and they report\n\nabillaccordingly; lest, however, there should be some mistake as to the amount which they\n\nhave already received, we so frame it as that,by adjustment at the department, they may be paid so much as remain unpaid for service actually performed by them—not\n\ncharging them with the credits given to Reeside.
