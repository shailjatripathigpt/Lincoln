However, a member of the Illinois General Assembly\n                  could not run for the U. S.

McDaniel’s victory did not help Lincoln’s cause\n                  in the election for Senate, as McDaniel cast his vote initially forJames Shieldsand later forJoel A. Matteson.   Ultimately, Lincoln did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General\n                  Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Boal cast his vote for Lincoln on nine ballots before switching to Trumbull\n                  on the final ballot.  See1854 Federal Election.Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.
