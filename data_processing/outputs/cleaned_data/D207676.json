        "text": "5In this letter, Lincoln discusses a legal case about which much remains unknown. What\n                  is known is that in the case,Unknown v. Smith & Smith, an unknown plaintiff, represented by Lincoln, sued Smith and Smith in theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinoisregarding a chancery action.  The chancery or equity division of the law is devoted\n                  to settling legal issues where there is no remedy in the common law. As in the case\n                  of common law pleading, the purpose of chancery, or equity, pleading is to bring the\n                  subject matter of contention to an issue affirmed by one side and denied by the other.The “process” Lincoln refers to “having been served on the Smiths” most likely relates\n                  to a summons (also referred to as a subpoena in chancery law), which chancery law\n                  requires the clerk of the court, William Pope in this instance, to issue after receiving\n                  the initial bill of complaint in the case. The summons would have directed the sheriff,\n                  who, in this case was Peter Van Bergen, to notify the named respondent of a case against\n                  them  and to order them to appear at the next term of court. As Lincoln notes in this\n                  letter, Van Bergen stated that the summons had not yet been served to the Smiths.Other details related to the case, including its outcome, are unknown.Unknown v. Smith & Smith, Martha L.
