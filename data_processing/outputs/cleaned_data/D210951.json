        "text": "2On September 13, Abraham LincolnspokeinGreenville, Illinois. Lincoln was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Lincoln and Douglas debated in Alton, Illinois, on October 15, in the seventh and\n                  last of theLincoln-Douglas Debates.  In local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but pro-Douglas\n                  Democrats retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection.
