        "text": "4Jacob Harding’s response has not been located.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into theelection campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats. Lincoln began quietly seeking support for a Senate candidacy, writing confidentially\n                  to Harding and other political allies and friends.The state’s voters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  in which Lincoln also won a seat. However, in late-November 1854, he declined to serve\n                  in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election to\n                  the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Watson cast his ballot for Lincoln until the eighth ballot, when he switched\n                  to Trumbull.
