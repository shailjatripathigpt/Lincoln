        "text": "5By this, the committee meant Democrats appointed to federal offices, who received\n                  federal income. Whigs believed this made these men dangerously loyal to their party\n                  and President Van Buren, giving them an advantage in the upcoming election.  The Whigs\n                  had good reasons to fear: the number of federal officeholders had been greatly expanded\n                  by the system to take the 1840 census, and the officeholders did involve themselves\n                  in advancing the Democratic cause.  This was particularly true of postmasters, who\n                  distributed copies of theExtra Globe, the official campaign sheet and, according to some, blocked distribution of Whig\n                  campaign literature.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 21 February 1840, 2:2; Major L.
