        "text": "2The”difficulty” betweenLincolnandAndersonoccurred during the final, last hectic days of  thepresidential campaign of 1840.  Lincoln was canvassing the southern counties ofIllinoison behalf ofWilliam Henry Harrisonand theWhig Party. On October 28, Lincoln gave a speech atLawrenceville.  Anderson “repeatedly interrupted” Lincoln, contending that the orator was “falsifying\n                  the acts and record of theDemocratic party.” Lincoln’s retort was apparently testy enough to prompt Anderson to write this letter.\n                  Lincoln diffused the situation with a conciliatoryletteron October 31. In 1970, the Lawrence County Historical Society and the Illinois Historical\n                  Society erected a marker  on the north side of courthouse square in Lawrenceville\n                  commemorating the Lincoln/Anderson dispute.Michael Burlingame, Abraham Lincoln: A Life (Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University\n                     Press, 2008), 1:158-59;http://www.historyillinois.org/FindAMarker/MarkerDetails.aspx?MarkerID=144."
