        "text": "3In the 1830s, brothers Leroy and Silas Hill purchased 320 acres of land for $800.\n                  This land was on Bear Creek inChristian County, Illinois. The brothers gave the seller a promissory note for the sale price, and Silas mortgaged\n                  the land to ensure payment of the note.  In 1841, Silas Hill died, and Paulina T.\n                  Hill, his widow, assumed responsibility for managing the land and paying the mortgage.\n                  In March 1848, Bennett, Paulina T. Hill’s son from a previous marriage, purchased\n                  the north portion of the land for $400.  In 1850, Bennett sold the land to Benjamin\n                  F. Maupin, his brother-in-law, for $400.  Leroy L. Hill claimed to have paid the interest\n                  payments on the mortgage since the original land purchase, and he wanted Bennett to\n                  reimburse him for these payments, which he claimed Bennett agreed to do under terms\n                  of the 1848 sale agreement.  Bennett failed to pay the whole amount due, and in February\n                  1850, Hill sued Bennett and Maupin for $317.12, the amount of the interest payments.\n                  In an answer and cross-bill filed in August 1850, Maupin countered that Leroy L. Hill\n                  had not made all the interest payments he claimed to have made and that he had swindled\n                  Bennett into a usurious sale agreement.  He also asserted that Leroy L. Hill had sold\n                  four slaves owned by Paulina T. Hill and kept the proceeds for himself, negating any\n                  claims that Leroy L. Hill may have against either Paulina T. Hill or Bennett.  Paulina\n                  T. Hill and her mother, Elizabeth H. Haily, testified in January 1851 that Leroy L. Hill had sold the four slaves and kept the\n                  proceeds of the sales.  They also testified that Leroy L. Hill had no claim to the\n                  land Paulina T. Hill sold to Bennett.Hill retained Lincoln,John T. Stuart, andBenjamin S. Edwards, and Lincoln  took this affidavit, requesting a continuance of the case until Thomas\n                  Morgan, one of the slave purchasers, could testify.  JudgeDavid Davisapproved the motion for a continuance.In June 1852, Lincoln and his co-counselors moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Leroy L.\n                  Hill agreed to pay all court costs, and Judge Davis dismissed the lawsuit without\n                  prejudice, allowing both sides to withdraw their evidence.For documents related to this case, seeHill v. Bennett & Maupin, Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition, 2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),http://www.lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Details.aspx?case=136752.
