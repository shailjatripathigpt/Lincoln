In the case, J.  H. Alexander & Company  claimed that both Roberts and Edward C.\n                  Morse of the firm Roberts & Morse owed them $1,136.83 on an account. After Roberts\n                  and Morse failed to pay, J. H. Alexander & Company sued them in an action of assumpsit\n                  and requested $2,000 in damages. Roberts retained Logan and Lincoln and argued that\n                  he was not a partner with Morse and that the debt was Morse's alone. The case came\n                  before theU.S. Circuit Court, Southern District of Illinoisin January 1857. The parties ultimately reached an agreement and, in January 1860,\n                  the court ruled for J. H. Alexander and Company against both Roberts and Morse and\n                  awarded $687.78.J. H. Alexander & Co. v. Roberts & Morse, Martha L.
