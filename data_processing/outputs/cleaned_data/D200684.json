        "text": "2This is a reference toPeople ex rel. Stephenson v. Marshall, a legal case involving challenges to the constitutionality of the incorporation\n                  of Saline County, Illinois into Gallatin County, Illinois.In 1847, theIllinois General Assemblydivided Gallatin County,  and formed Saline County out of its northwest portion.Shawneetownbecame the county seat of Gallatin County, and, in late-1847, Saline County’s residents\n                  selectedRaleighas their county's seat. From 1847 until early 1851, the Saline County Circuit Court\n                  met regularly in Raleigh, since Raleigh was the county seat. On February 1, 1851,\n                  the Illinois General Assembly passed an act that brought both Gallatin and Saline\n                  counties into the Twelfth Judicial Circuit. On February 11, 1851, however,  the Illinois\n                  General Assembly passed an act to merge Saline County back into  Gallatin County and\n                  establishEqualityas the county seat of the new, merged Gallatin County.Samuel S. Marshall, the judge of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit, held court in Equality, but refused to\n                  do so in Raleigh, arguing that, per the Illinois General Assembly, Saline County no\n                  longer existed.William K. Stephenson, a citizen of Saline County, believed that the 1851 act merging\n                  Gallatin and Saline counties was unconstitutional because the Illinois General Assembly\n                  did not provide for a public vote on the matter. He retained Robert F. Wingate as\n                  his attorney, who in turn recruited Lincoln to assist with the case. In  June 1851,\n                  Wingate and Lincoln sued in theIllinois Supreme Courtfor a writ of mandamus ordering Marshall to hold court in Raleigh.  Writs of mandamus\n                  are only used in exceptional cases, when all other means of enforcement have been\n                  unsuccessful. They can compel a public official, such as a judge, to perform their\n                  official duty.On July 3, 1851, the Illinois Supreme Court awarded the writ of mandamus and ruled\n                  that the Illinois General Assembly’s 1851 act violated the state’s constitution. \n                  JusticeJohn D. Catondeclared that the abolition of Gallatin and Saline counties and the creation of a\n                  new Gallatin County had to be approved by the counties' voters.  Caton stated that\n                  the 1851 law “practically undertakes to remove a county seat by legislative action\n                  alone.”  He concluded that the counties could not be united, nor the county seat removed,\n                  without “the constitutional sanction of the people.”Eugene L.
