        "text": "3Phillips is discussing the 1858 election campaign. SouthernIllinois, where Phillips resided, was largely a Democratic stronghold where Republican candidates\n                  would face an uphill battle in 1858. The Democratic Party in Illinois was split at\n                  this time, however, between supporters of Stephen A. Douglas and backers of President\n                  James Buchanan. The rift was caused when Douglas criticized theLecompton Constitutionand Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857. Among Illinois Republicans there was\n                  hope that the division in the Democratic Party, which resulted in competing Democratic\n                  candidates in some races, would improve the chances of Republican candidates. Republican\n                  Phillips and Douglas Democrat John A. Logan were ultimately the candidates for theU.S. House of Representativesin the Ninth Congressional District of Illinois in 1858. Logan won election by a\n                  large margin, earning 84.2 percent of the vote, while Phillips received 14.8 percent.\n                  Although early rumors suggested that John Dougherty  would be the candidate of the\n                  Buchanan Democrats in the Ninth Congressional District of Illinois in 1858, Dougherty\n                  was instead nominated to run for Illinois state treasurer at an Illinois Buchanan\n                  Democratic convention on June 9, 1858. He came in third behind successfully reelected\n                  Republican incumbentJames Millerand Douglas DemocratWilliam B. Fondey.Allen C.

        "text": "4Abraham Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Douglas to represent Illinois in theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatesuch as Phillips discusses here were of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.Perry and Washington counties constituted the Seventh Illinois House District, in\n                  which Douglas Democrat John D. Wood did indeed run for office in 1858. Democrat John\n                  Crain, presumably a Buchanan Democrat in contrast to Wood, does not seem to have run.\n                  One published election return lists an otherwise unidentified candidate in the race\n                  with the surname Guyman in a column of Buchanan Democrats, but differentiates him\n                  with the designation of “Ind.” or Independent. Wood ultimately won the election with\n                  1,832 votes, defeating Republican or Opposition candidate Samuel Y. Henry, who earned\n                  959 votes, and Guyman, who received 19 votes in Perry County and none in Washington\n                  County. Although Henry had a stronger showing in Perry County than in Washington County,\n                  he did not win the county as Phillips hoped. The Illinois House of Representatives\n                  seat was the only General Assembly position up for election in 1858 in these counties,\n                  as Perry and Washington, along withClinton,Jackson, andRandolphcounties comprised the Twenty-Fourth Illinois Senate District, where Democrat Elzey\n                  C. Coffey held over in 1858.  See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:457-58; Allen C.

Both Republicans and Democrats criticized this strategy, and it was\n                  of particular irritation to Douglas. On the date of this letter from Phillips, Lincoln\n                  wrote to invite Douglas to a series of debates. In negotiating terms for what would\n                  become theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln promised to no longer be at any more of Douglas’ “exclusive meetings” and\n                  in early August Lincoln declined requests from several Republicans in different parts\n                  of the state to speak in conjunction with Douglas events.Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.
