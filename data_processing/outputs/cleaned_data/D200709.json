        "text": "3This is a reference to the legal caseSmith v. Gardner, which was an ejectment case that began trial at theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinoison January 20, 1852. In American law, “ejectment” relates to an action to recover\n                  land or other real property and to collect damages. Originally, in the English common\n                  law, only tenants could use this action to recover possession of land from which they\n                  had been unlawfully ousted. Because of the simplicity and swiftness of the ejectment\n                  procedure, landowners began to use this action to recover land. To do so, the landowner,\n                  on behalf of a fictitious tenant (John Doe), sued a fictitious defendant (Richard\n                  Roe) for ousting the fictitious tenant. The court titled such cases John Doe ex dem.\n                  “Landowner” v. Richard Roe. When the defendant appeared in court, the clerk sometimes\n                  replaced “Richard Roe” with the defendant’s real name.   In anactpassed in March 1839, theIllinois General Assemblyabolished the need for the fictitious names. The losing party in an ejectment case\n                  was entitled by law to one new trial simply by paying the court costs.Lincoln, Wead, andOrville H. Browningserved as attorneys for the plaintiff,Spencer Smith, and Stephen T. Logan served as attorney forJames Gardner, the defendant. At the heart of the suit was   a dispute over Gardner’s occupation\n                  of 160 acres of land inFulton County, Illinois, land over which Smith claimed ownership and from which he wanted Gardner ejected.\n                  The original case was decided on January 26, 1852. JudgeThomas Drummondruled for Smith. The court determined that Gardner’s deed of August 1820 did not take\n                  precedence over Smith’s deed of January 1820 because, despite being recorded “defectively”\n                  in June 1820, Smith’s deed was “cured,” or made official, by an act in 1822 concerning\n                  deeds.Gardner subsequently paid the court costs, entitling him to a new trial, which Logan\n                  requested on January 27, 1852. Eventually, on February 1, 1853, the case was once\n                  again decided in favor of Smith.Complete Record, Document ID: 68744; Execution Docket, Document ID: 65797,Smith v.
