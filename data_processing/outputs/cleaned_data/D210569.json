TheDemocratic Partywon the district in each election since 1842, with Stephen A. Douglas as its representative\n                  in the Twenty-Eighth, Twenty-Ninth, and Thirtieth Congresses. After Douglas won election\n                  to theU.S. Senatein 1847, Democrat William A. Richardson filled this congressional seat.

However, as four additional\n                  letters from Randolph reveal, Lincoln wrote him at least a few times in November and\n                  December 1854.The race between Richardson and Williams was close.  Richardson won 52.4 percent of\n                  the district’s votes to Williams’ 47.6 percent. In McDonough County, Richardson emerged\n                  with 50.7 percent of the vote to Williams’ 49.3 percent. In the state as a whole,\n                  anti-Nebraska candidates fared better, winning five of nine congressional districts\n                  and 52 percent of the vote compared to Democratic candidates’ 43 percent.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, in late-November 1854,\n                  declined to serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, he  did not win\n                  election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska\n                  DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
