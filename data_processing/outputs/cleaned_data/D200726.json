Along with Thornton, Lincoln joined Eliott Crockett’s campaign to\n                  get his son pardoned, writing a petition to Governor Augustus French signed by citizens of Shelby and Moultrie counties. \n                  JudgeDavid Davisand State’s AttorneyDavid B. Campbelljoined Lincoln, other attorneys, several jurors, and county officials from Shelby,\n                  Coles and Moultrie counties seeking clemency for Crockett.   Although some students\n                  of the case claim that Governor French granted a pardon, there exists no documentation\n                  for this assertion.   French’s final decision in the matter is unknown.Elliott Crockett gave Lincoln a promissory note for his legal services but died in\n                  1855, leaving the note unpaid.  In December 1856, Lincoln sued Elliott Crockett's\n                  estate for payment in the Shelby County Court.  The court ruled for Lincoln and awarded\n                  him $64.12.Letter, Document ID: 89442; Petition for Pardon, Document ID: 89443, 89444, 89445;\n                     Certificate, Document ID: 89446,People v.
