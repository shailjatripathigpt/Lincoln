        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln, the candidate of theRepublican Party, was challengingStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for seat in theU.S. Senate.   Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat.  Lincoln and Douglas alsodebatedat seven locations across the state in the lead up to the election, which saw Douglas\n                  defeat Lincoln for the Senate seat. See1858 Federal Election;1858 Illinois Republican Convention.  The fourth of these seven debates was held inCharleston, Illinoison September 18, 1858. Abraham Lincoln arrived in Charleston that morning  after\n                  spending the night before inMattoon, Illinois. A local Republican leader,Henry P. H. Bromwell, gave a shortreception speechupon Lincoln’s arrival to the Capitol House in Charleston, promoting both Abraham\n                  Lincoln’s candidacy and the Republican party’s pro-free labor stance. The short remarks\n                  listed here are Lincoln’s response to that reception speech. He would debate Douglas\n                  later that day to a crowd of over ten thousand.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 21 September 1858, 1:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458-60, 516-25; Allen C.\n                     Guelzo, “Houses Divided: Lincoln, Douglas, and the Political Landscape of 1858,”The Journal of American History94 (September 2007), 392-94; George Fort Milton, \"Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\"Dictionary of American History,  rev. ed.

        "text": "3Lincoln would begin the debate that afternoon shortly before 3:00 PM. The principle\n                  issue of debate between Lincoln and Douglas was that of the expansion of slavery into\n                  the territories that were being admitted to the United States. Lincoln was in favor\n                  of limiting or halting the expansion of slavery into these new territories while Douglas\n                  promoted the idea that the local population should decide the issue. While Douglas\n                  would go on to win theelection, thedebatespropelled Lincoln into national recognition.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:443-557; Allen C.
