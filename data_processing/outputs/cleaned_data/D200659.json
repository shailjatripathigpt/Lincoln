        "text": "4Alexander Campbell suedJames Allinin theMcLean County Circuit Courtfor an injunction concerning a deed to certain property.  Campbell retained Lincoln;\n                  Allin retainedAsahel Gridley.   In April 1853, Campbell dismissed his bill of injunction.Editors ofThe Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Editionlisted Edwin W. Bakewell as a plaintiff attorney alongside Lincoln, but Bakewell\n                  was most likely a plaintiff alongside Campbell.  In alettertoRobert E. Williamsin August 1857, Lincoln references that he recollected a transaction between Bakewell\n                  and Allin which probably refers to the case in 1850.Editors ofThe Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Editionidentified the defendant as James Allin Jr., but the alphabetical docket of judgments\n                  and executions listed the defendant as James Allin, Sr., father ofJames Allin, Jr., who was the clerk of the McLean County Circuit Court.For documents related to this suit, seeCampbell v.
