        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote the body of the letter and his signature.William E. Taylor in 1957 estimated the date of Lincoln’s letter as January 1841,\n                  and Roy P. Basler followed suit in 1974.  Taylor surmised that Lincoln’s letter was\n                  in response to word that McCormick planned to vote for Walters in a bid for re-election\n                  againstSimeon Francis, a friend of Lincoln and editor of the WhigSangamo Journal. That  election occurred on January 23, 1841, and Walters defeated Francis, 70 votes\n                  to 50 votes, with Lincoln voting for Francis.  However, McCormick was not a member\n                  of the General Assembly in January 1841, having chosen not to run for re-election\n                  the prior August.  Lincoln’s letter could be in reference either to the election in\n                  January 1837, when Walters defeated sixteen challengers--Lincoln voted forWilliam Hodge, and McCormick forGeorge Forquer--or Walters’s bid for re-election in January 1839, when he defeated Hodge by 65 votes\n                  to 63 votes, with Lincoln and McCormick both voting for Hodge.  The closeness of the\n                  vote and Lincoln’s imploring tone suggest that the 1839 election was mostly likely\n                  the catalyst for Lincoln’s letter.Illinois HouseJournal. 1836. 10th G.
