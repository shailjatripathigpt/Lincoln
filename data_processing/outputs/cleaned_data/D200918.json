        "text": "3Lincoln was in high demand as a speaker for theRepublican Partyduring the1856 Federal Electioncampaign. He delivered more than fifty speeches throughoutIllinoisas he stumped on behalf of Republican candidates, including in southern Illinois.\n                  Relatively few Republicans lived in southern Illinois, however, a fact which prompted\n                  concern about the party’s prospects in that region of the state.One reason Lincoln may have felt that he owed Boal was because Boal supported him\n                  during his bid for a seat in theU.S. Senateduring theelection of 1854. Boal cast his vote for Lincoln during the first nine rounds of voting in that contest,\n                  and only switched his vote toLyman Trumbullin the tenth and final round upon Lincoln’s direction.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:401-2, 425, 428;Lyman Trumbull to Abraham Lincoln;Robert Boal to Abraham Lincoln;Robert Boal to Abraham Lincoln; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
