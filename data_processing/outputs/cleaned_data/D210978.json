        "text": "3Judd references the state elections inIllinois, which occurred on November 2, 1858.   Lincoln, the candidate of theRepublican Party, was challengingStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for seat in theU.S. Senate.   Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat.  Lincoln and Douglas alsodebatedat seven Illinois towns  during the campaign.    See1858 Federal Election;1858 Illinois Republican Convention.In the state’s local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in the state, tallying 190,468 votes to 166,374 for Democrats. Pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly, however, winning forty seats to thirty-five\n                  for the Republicans in the Illinois House  and fourteen seats to eleven for the Republicans\n                  in the Illinois Senate, allowing Douglas to win reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through\n                  the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 November 1858, 2:1, 9 November 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458-60, 492-540, 556-57;\n                     Allen C.

As Lincoln noted hisletterto Judd of November 15, this threatened the reelection ofLyman Trumbullto the U.S. Senate in 1860. In the state elections of 1860, Republicans won control\n                  of both the Illinois House and Senate, gaining a one seat majority in the Senate and\n                  five seat majority in the House, allowing Trumbull to win reelection.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:546-47;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 9 November, 1858, 2:1; 6 January, 1859, 2:2;Illinois Daily State Journal(Springfield), 11 December 1860, 2:3;Ottawa Free Trade(IL), 15 December 1860, 1:6; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.

TheChicago Daily Press and Tribunewrote that he had gave himself “a splendid national reputation. Identified all his\n                  life long with the oldWhig party, always in a minority in Illinois, his fine abilities and attainments have necessarily\n                  been confined to a very limited sphere. He entered upon the canvass with a reputation\n                  confined to his own State— he closed it with his name a household word wherever the\n                  principles he holds are honored, and with the respect of his opponents in all sections\n                  of the country.”   Some began to think of Lincoln as a presidential candidate in1860.Jesse Fellconfided to Lincoln that “Judge Douglas being so widely known, you are getting a\n                  national reputation.... Yourdiscussionwith Judge Douglas had demonstrated your ability and your devotion to freedom; you\n                  have no embarrassing record; you have sprung from the humble walks of life, sharing\n                  in its toils and trials; and if only we can get these facts sufficiently before the\n                  people, depend on it, there is some chance for you.”Horace Whiteof theChicago Tribunewrote that “Lincoln’s “popular majority in the state will giveusthe privilege of naming our man on the national ticket in 1860.” As of November of\n                  1858, Lincoln had yet to make any decisions about his political future following his\n                  loss to Douglas.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 29 October, 1858,  1:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:556-57; Allen C.

It is estimated that the campaign personally\n                  cost $1,000 to Lincoln, compared to $50,000 to Douglas.
