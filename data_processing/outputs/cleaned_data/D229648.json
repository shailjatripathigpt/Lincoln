For many historians,\n                  this cryptic letter reinforces that postulation.  While the date makes it plausible\n                  to conclude that it is referring to Lincoln’s patent application--he was actively\n                  seeking a patent during this time--there is no veritable proof.   Lincoln submitted\n                  his patent application to theU.S. Patent Officeon March 10, 1849, and On May 22, the Patent Office approved his application and\n                  issued him patent number 6,469.Jason Emerson,Lincoln the Inventor, 17-18."
