    "full_text": "An Undeviating Jackson Man to the Editors of The Old Soldier, 7 February 1840 Gentleman:—I have just seen and read the first number of the Old Soldier. There is\n\nnot an article in it that I do not admire; and if future numbers are as good as this,\n\nit must be the means of rallying hundreds, if not thousands, to the standard of thehero of the North West. I was not of that gallant band underGen. Jackson, atNew Orleans, on the ever memorable 8th of January; nor was I underGen. HarrisonatTippecanoe; but I was with him at the equally memorablebattle of the Thames. Let no one call him a coward: let no one call him apetticoat general;— thousands who shared with him the perils, the privations and glory of thatcampaign, can attest the contrary. The foes he contended with, the country through which\n\nhe marched, without roads, and destitute of supplies for his army, all made against\n\nhim; but I fearlessly say, and I call upon all who shared his difficulties to say,\n\nif in their opinion, any man, under the circumstances, could have conducted this war\n\nwith more honor, or with more glorious results to the country. I have known Gen. Jackson intimately, both before, and since he became President of\n\nthe United States. I too, like the Old Soldier, in your first number, “have had the\n\npleasure of voting for himthree times,” although I differed with him in one or two cardinal points of his administration.\n\nI knew his honesty, and tried patriotism, and could not be induced to forsake him.\n\nI preferred him to aBank of the United States,although I deemed such aninstitutionuseful and proper for the country. I still think so. I have conversed with hundreds\n\nof the old Jackson friends, and I confidently believe, aside from prejudice, andparty dictation, that a majority of them still think with me. It is true that theleaders of thepartyhave told us, that the Bank was aMonster, and was insidiously stealing away theliberties of the country. I tried for years to think so, but I never could; and the last few years of bank\n\nissues, bank speculations, bank suspensions, and bank papershaves, which we have suffered whenever we have had to travel an hundred miles from the bank whose paper we had in our pockets,—have convinced me\n\nthat our first opinion was right, and that nothing can now redeem the country, and\n\nher currency, but a Bank of the United States, well restricted and regulated. The\n\ncountry forforty yearsout of about fifty of its existence, has prospered under its operations, and we have\n\nreason to believe the same prosperity, in a few years, would attend its re-establishment. Gen. Jackson, however, thought differently; and, I have no doubt, thought so honestly.—Believing\n\nthat he did, I forgave him for that which I believed to be an error of the head; and\n\nsustained him, in preference to the Bank. Why I did so, I cannot very well tell,\n\nexcept thatmy party voted for him, and I thought I must do so too. Moreover, there was no candidate running against\n\nhim with any hope of success. The Union Ticket, composed ofClay,Webster,White, and Harrison, I could not, at that time, very well go, although I went with alacrity\n\ntheJacksonVan BurenTicket.1If, however, Gen. Harrison had been alone in the field against Mr. Van Buren, as\n\nhe is now, I should not have hesitated. In1824, Gen. Jackson was, as some said, unfairly dealt with inCongressby a corrupt coalition betweenMr. Adamsand Mr. Clay. I never believed in this coalition, but I had other good objections\n\nto Mr. Adams. He was an eastern man, had no personal knowledge of the West, and the\n\nwants of its citizens. Gen. Jackson had, and he declared himself in favor ofone Presidential term. It is true I voted for him to serve a second term. My feelings had become enlisted\n\nin his favor, and the strong voice of the country called upon him to serve two terms.\n\nStill my opinion of its correctness was not changed, and neither was his.—Mr. Van\n\nBuren has now served one term, and he shall never serve another with my consent.\n\nThe same objections, too, exist against him that I had to Mr. Adams. He is an Eastern\n\nman, has no feelings in common with the West, except when it is his interest; he is\n\natime-serving politician, as his whole history shows, and with which, I confess, I was unacquainted until\n\nhe became President.2He wasanabolitionistwhenMissouri was to be admitted into the Union, and wished for free negroes to vote inNew York; he is now anti-abolitionist to secure a second election. In1828, he was opposed to graduating the price of public lands, opposed to pre-emptions,\n\nand opposed to giving the lands to the States in which they are situated, after having\n\nbeen sometime offered for sale. In1812, he voted forMr. Clinton, the anti-warfederalist, againstMr. Madison, theRepublicanwar-candidate, for the Presidency. He is nowademocrat!Until it was seen that Gen. Jackson would be made President, he was in favor of Mr.\n\nAdams. He afterwards became the ardent supporter of that distinguished individual.\n\nHe intriguedMr. Calhounout of the good graces of Gen. Jackson, and became the first favorite of that confiding\n\nand honest man. Mr. Calhoun denounced him as a scoundrel, and refused to speak to\n\nhim. They have now formed a most unnatural coalition, and for the time being, are\n\nfast friends. The contract is, thatMr. Bentonis to be cast aside, and Mr. Calhoun is to succeed Mr. Van Buren to the Presidency.3 I could ennumerate other objections to Mr. Van Buren, but these in all conscience, are enough. The\n\nreasons we voted for Gen. Jackson were, that he was honest, that he was a Western\n\nman, that he was patriotic, that years devoted to the service of his country proved\n\nit; and that for these services, his country owed him honor. Now I ask the Old Jackson men, if we cannot support Gen. Harrison for the same reasons?\n\nIt is needless for me, in this letter, to recount the claims of Gen. Harrison, to\n\nthe good citizens of the West. Let them look toOhio,Indiana, and our ownIllinois; and whatever they can find interesting in their History, but bespeaks the eulogy\n\nof Harrison—whose whole life has been devoted to their growth, their government, and\n\ntheir defence. Before closing, I suggest that the Old Soldiers meet in Convention, at some convenient\n\npoint in theState,on the 4th of July, for the more perfect organization of the Harrison party.4",

Democrats hoped to maintain Jackson’s\n                  electoral coalition by holding their first national convention and unanimously nominating\n                  Van Buren, but a minority instead supported White’s nomination. When White allied\n                  with several members of the nascentWhig Party, such as Clay and Webster, the Union ticket was the result, making White’s candidacy\n                  a precedent for Harrison’s official Whig nomination four years later.Kenneth J.
