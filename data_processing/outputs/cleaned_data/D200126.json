    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to James Adams, 18 October 1837 TO THE PUBLIC. Such is the turn which things have lately taken, that whenGen. Adamswrites a book, I am expected to write a commentary on it. In theRepublicanof this morning he has presented the world with a new work of six columns in length:\n\nin consequence of which I must beg the room of one column in theJournal.1It is obvious that a minute reply cannot be made in one column to every thing that\n\ncan be said in six: and, consequently, I hope that expectation will be answered, if\n\nI reply to such parts of theGeneral’s publication as are worth replying to.2 It may not be improper to remind the reader that in his publication of Sept. 6th.\n\nGeneral Adams said that the assignment charge was manufacturedjust before the election; and that in reply I proved that statement to be false byKeyes, his own witness. Now, without attempting to explain, he furnishes me with another\n\nwitness (Tinsley) by which the same thing is proved, to wit, that the assignmentwas notmanufacturedjust before the election:3but that it was seensome weeksbefore. Let it be borne in mind that Adams made this statement—has himself furnished\n\ntwo witnesses to prove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or explain it.\n\nBefore going farther, let a pin be stuck here, labelled, “one lie proved and confessed.”\n\nOn the 6th of Sept, he said he had before stated in a handbill that he held an assignment\n\ndated May 20th, 1828, which in reply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the\n\nhand bill for the truth of what I said. This week he forgets to make any explanation\n\nof this. Let another pin be stuck here, labelled as before. I mention these things,\n\nbecause, if, when I convict him in one falsehood, he is permitted to shift his ground,\n\nand pass it by in silence, there can be no end to this controversy. The first thing that attracts my attention in the General’s present production, is\n\nthe information he is pleased to give to “those who are made to suffer at his (my)hands.” Under present circumstances, this cannot apply to me, for I am not awidownor anorphan; nor have I a wife or children who by possibility might become such. Such, however,\n\nI have no doubt, have been, and will again be made to suffer at hishands!!Hands!yes, they are the mischievous agents.—The next thing I shall notice is his favorite\n\nexpression, “knot of lawyers, doctors and others,” which he is so fond of applying\n\nto all who dare expose his rascality. Now, let it be remembered that when he first\n\ncame to this country, he attempted to impose himself upon the community as alawyerand actually carried the attempt so far, as to induce a man who was under a charge\n\nof murder to intrust the defence of his life in his hands, and finally took his money\n\nand got him hanged. Is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by abusing\n\nlawyers? If he is not himself a lawyer, it is for the lack of sense, and not of inclination.\n\nIf he is not a lawyer, heisa liar, for he proclaimed himself a lawyer, and got a man hanged by depending on\n\nhim.4 Passing over such parts of the article as have neither fact nor argument in them,\n\nI come to the question asked by Adams whether any person ever saw the assignment in\n\nhis possession. This is an insult to common sense.Talbotthas swore once, and repeated time and again, that he got itoutof Adams’ possession and returned itintothe same possession. Still, as though he was addressing fools, he has assurance\n\nto ask if any person every saw it in his possession.—Next I quote a sentence “Now\n\nmy sonLucianswears that when Talbot called for the deed, that he, Talbott, opened it andpointed out the error.” True. His son Lucian did swear as he says; and in doing so, he swore what I will\n\nprove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood. Turn to Lucian’s affidavit, and you\n\nwill there see, that Talbott called for the deed by which to correct an error on therecord. Thus it appears that the error in question was on therecord, and not in thedeed. How then could Talbott open the deed and point out theerror?Where a thingis not, it cannot be pointed out. The errorwas notin thedeed, and of course could not be pointed out there. This does not merely prove, that\n\nthe error could not be pointed out, asLucienswore it was; but it proves, too, that the deed was not opened in his presence, with\n\na special view to the error, for if it had been, he could not have failed to see that\n\nthere was no error in it. It is easy enough to see why Lucien swore this. His object\n\nwas to prove that the assignmentwas notin the deed, when Talbott got it; but it was discovered he could not swear this safely,\n\nwithout first swearing the deed wasopened—and if he swore it wasopened, he must show amotivefor opening it, and the conclusion with him and his father was, that the pointing\n\nout the error, would appear the most plausible. For the purpose of showing that the assignment was not in the bundle when Talbott\n\ngot it, is the story introduced in Lucian’s affidavit, that the deeds werecounted. It is a remarkable fact, and one that should stand as a warning to all liars and\n\nfabricators, that in this short affidavit of Lucian’s, he only attempted to depart\n\nfrom the truth, so far as I have the means of knowing, in two points, to wit, inthe opening the deed and pointing out the error; and thecounting of the deeds,—and in both of these he caught himself. About the counting, he caught himself thus—After\n\nsaying the bundle containedfivedeeds and a lease, he proceeds, “ and I saw no other papers than thesaid deedand lease.” First he hassixpapers, and then he saw none buttwo. For “my son Lucian’s” benefit, let a pin be stuck here. Adams again adduces the argument, that he could not have forged the assignment, for\n\nthe reason that he could have had nomotivefor it. With those that know the facts there is no absence of motive. Admitting\n\nthe paper, which he has filed in the suit to be genuine, it is clear thatitcannot answer the purpose for which he designs it. Hence his motive for making\n\none that he supposed would answer, is obvious.— His making the date too old is also\n\neasily enough accounted for. The records were not in his hands, and then there being\n\nsome considerable talk upon this particular subject, he knew he could not examine\n\nthe records to ascertain the precise dates without subjecting himself to suspicion;\n\nand hence he concluded to try it by guess, and as it turned out, missed it a little.\n\nAboutMiller’s deposition, I have a word to say. In the first place, Miller’s answer to the first\n\nquestion shows upon its face, that he had been tampered with, and the answer dictated\n\nto him. He was asked if he knewJoel Wright5and James Adams; and above three-fourths of his answer consists of what he knew aboutJoseph Anderson, a man about whom nothing has been asked, nor a word said in the question—a fact\n\nthat can only be accounted for upon the supposition, that Adams had secretly told\n\nhim what he wished him to swear to. Another of Miller’s answers I will prove both by common sense and the court of record\n\nis untrue. To one question he answers, “Anderson brought a suit against me before\n\nJames Adams, then an acting Justice of Peace inSangamon County, before whom he obtained a judgment. Q. Did youremovethe same by injunction to theSangamon Circuit Court? Answer. I did remove it. Now mark—it is said heremovedit byinjunction. The word “injunction” in common language imports a command that some person or thing shall notmoveor beremoved; in law it has the same meaning. An injunction issuing out of chancery to a Justice\n\nof the Peace, is a command to him to stop all proceedings in a named case till further\n\norders. It is not an order toremove, but tostopor stay something that is alreadymoving. Besides this, the records of the Sangamon Circuit Court show, that the judgement\n\nof which Miller swore was never removed into said court by injunction or otherwise. I have now to take notice of a part of Adam’s address which in the order of time should\n\nhave been noticed before. It is in these words, “I have now shown, in the opinion\n\nof 2 competent judges that the hand writing of the forged assignment differed from\n\nmine,and by one of them that it could not be mistaken for mine.” That is false.Tinselyno doubt is the judge referred to; and by reference to his certificate it will be\n\nseen, that he did not say the hand writing of the assignment could not be mistaken\n\nfor Adams’—nor did he use any other expression substantially, or any thing near substantially\n\nthe same. But if Tinsley had said the hand writing could not be mistaken for Adams’,\n\nit would have been equally unfortunate for Adams: for it then would have contradicted\n\nKeyes, who says, “I looked at the writing and judged it the said Adams’ or a good\n\nimitation.” Adams speaks with much apparent confidence of his success on the pending law suit,\n\nand the ultimate maintainance of his title to the land in question. Without wishing\n\nto disturb the pleasure of his dream, I would say to him that it is not impossible,\n\nthat he may yet be taught to sing a different song in relation to the matter. At the end of Miller’s deposition, Adams asks, “Will Mr. Lincolnnowsay that he is almost convinced my title to this ten acre tract of land is founded\n\nin fraud?” I answer, I will not. I willnowchange the phraseology so as to make it run—I amquiteconvinced, &c. I cannot pass in silence Adams’ assertion that he has proved that the forged assignment\n\nwas not in the deed when it came from his house byTalbott, the Recorder. In this, although Talbott has sworn that the assignment was in the\n\nbundle of deeds when it came from his house, Adams has the unaccountable assurance\n\nto say that he has proved the contrary by Talbott.—Let him, or his friends attempt\n\nto show, wherein he proved any such thing by Talbott. In his publication of the 6th of Sept. hehintedto Talbott, thathe might be mistaken. In his present, speaking of Talbott and me, he says “They may have been imposed upon.”—Can any man of the least penetration fail to see the object of this? After he\n\nhas stormed and raved till he hopes or imagines that he has got us a little scared,\n\nhe wishes to softly whisper in our ears, “If you’ll quit I will.” If he could get us to say, that some unknown, undefined being had slipped the assignment\n\ninto our hands without our knowledge, not a doubt remains but that he would immediately\n\ndiscover, that we were the purest men on earth. This is the ground he evidently wishes\n\nus to understand he is willing to compromise upon. But we ask no such charity at\n\nhis hands. We are neithermistakennorimposed upon. We have made the statements we have, because we know then to be true—and we choose\n\nto live or die by them. Esq. Carter, who is Adams’ friend, personal and political, will recollect, that, on the 5th of\n\nthis month, he, (Adams) with a great affectation of modesty, declared that he would\n\nnever introduce his own child as a witness. Notwithstanding this affectation of modesty,\n\nhe has in his present publication, introduced his child as a witness; and as if to\n\nshow with how much contempt he could treat his own declaration, he has had this same\n\nEsq. Carter to administer the oath to him. And so important a witness does he consider\n\nhim, and so entirely does the whole of his present production depend upon the testimony\n\nof his child, that in it he has mentioned “my son,” “my son Lucien,” “Lucien my son,”\n\nand the like expressions no less than fifteen different times. Let it be remembered\n\nhere, that I have shown the affidavit of “my darling son Lucien,” to be false by the\n\nevidence apparent on its own face; and I now ask if that affidavit be taken away,\n\nwhat foundation will the fabric have left to stand upon? General Adams’ publications and out-door manoevring, taken in connection with the\n\neditorial articles of the Republican, are not more foolish and contradictory than\n\nthey are ludicrous and amusing. One week the Republican notifies the public that\n\nGen. Adams is preparing aninstrumentthat will tear, rend, split, rive, blow up, confound, overwhelm, annihilate, extinguish,\n\nexterminate, burst asunder, and grind to powder all his slanderers, and particularly\n\nTalbott and Lincoln—all of which is to be donein due time. Then for two or three weeks all is calm—not a word said. Again the Republican\n\ncomes forth with a mere passing remark that “public opinion has decided in favor of\n\nGen. Adams,” and intimates that he will give himself no more trouble about the matter.\n\nIn the mean time Adams himself is prowling about, and asBurnssays of the devil, “For prey, a’ holes and corners tryin,6” and in one instance, goes so far as to take an old acquaintance of mine several\n\nsteps from a crowd, and apparently weighed down with the importance of his business,\n\ngravely and solemnly asks him if “he ever heard Lincoln say he was a deist.” Anon the Republican comes again, “ We invite the attention of the public to Gen.\n\nAdams communication,” &c., “The victory is a great one.” “The triumph is overwhelming.” (I really believe the\n\neditor of the Ill. Republican is fool enough to think General Adams is an honest man.)7Then Gen. Adams leads off.— “Authors most egregiously mistaken,” &c.— “most wofully shall their presumption be punished,” &c. (Lord have mercy on us.) “The hour is yet to come, yes nigh at hand—(how long first do you reckon?)—when the Journal and its junto shall say, I have appeared too early.”— “then infamy shall be laid bare to the public gaze.” Suddenly the Gen. appears to relent at the severity with which he is treating us\n\nand he exclaims, “The condemnation of my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defence.” For you health’s sake, dear Gen. do not permit your tenderness of heart to afflict you so\n\nmuch on our account. For some reason (perhaps because we are killed so quickly) we\n\nshall never be sensible of our suffering. Farewell, General. I will see you again at court, if not before—when and where we\n\nwill settle the question whether you or thewidowshall have the land.8",

This is an insult to common sense.Talbotthas swore once, and repeated time and again, that he got itoutof Adams’ possession and returned itintothe same possession.  Still, as though he was addressing fools, he has assurance\n               to ask if any person every saw it in his possession.—Next I quote a sentence “Now\n               my sonLucianswears that when Talbot called for the deed, that he, Talbott, opened it andpointed out the error.” True.  His son Lucian did swear as he says; and in doing so, he swore what I will\n               prove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood.  Turn to Lucian’s affidavit, and you\n               will there see, that Talbott called for the deed by which to correct an error on therecord.  Thus it appears that the error in question was on therecord, and not in thedeed.  How then could Talbott open the deed and point out theerror?Where a thingis not, it cannot be pointed out.  The errorwas notin thedeed, and of course could not be pointed out there.  This does not merely prove, that\n               the error could not be pointed out, asLucienswore it was; but it proves, too, that the deed was not opened in his presence, with\n               a special view to the error, for if it had been, he could not have failed to see that\n               there was no error in it.  It is easy enough to see why Lucien swore this.  His object\n               was to prove that the assignmentwas notin the deed, when Talbott got it; but it was discovered he could not swear this safely,\n               without first swearing the deed wasopened—and if he swore it wasopened, he must show amotivefor opening it, and the conclusion with him and his father was, that the pointing\n               out the error, would appear the most plausible."

Adams,” and intimates that he will give himself no more trouble about the matter.\n               In the mean time Adams himself is prowling about, and asBurnssays of the devil, “For prey, a’ holes and corners tryin,6” and in one instance, goes so far as to take an old acquaintance of mine several\n               steps from a crowd, and apparently weighed down with the importance of his business,\n               gravely and solemnly asks him if “he ever heard Lincoln say he was a deist.” Anon the Republican comes again, “ We invite the attention of the public to Gen.\n               Adams communication,”  &c., “The victory is a great one.” “The triumph is overwhelming.” (I really believe the\n               editor of the Ill. Republican is fool enough to think General Adams is an honest man.)7Then Gen. Adams leads off.— “Authors most egregiously mistaken,” &c.— “most wofully shall their presumption be punished,” &c. (Lord have mercy on us.) “The hour is yet to come, yes nigh at hand—(how long first do you reckon?)—when the Journal and its junto shall say, I have appeared too early.”— “then infamy shall be laid bare to the public gaze.” Suddenly the Gen. appears to relent at the severity with which he is treating us\n               and he exclaims, “The condemnation of my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defence.” For you health’s sake, dear Gen. do not permit your tenderness of heart to afflict you so\n               much on our account.  For some reason (perhaps because we are killed so quickly) we\n               shall never be sensible of our suffering."
