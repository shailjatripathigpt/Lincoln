        "text": "3Lincoln had recently lost his bid to becomeIllinois’ next U.S. Senator when theIllinois General Assemblymet in a joint session on February 8, 1855 to vote on the matter. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.In the first round of voting for the U.S. Senate seat by the General Assembly, ninety-nine\n                  votes were cast, of which Lincoln received forty-five including that ofThomas J. Turner, speaker of the House of Representatives, and anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbull received five. But as neither they nor any other candidate received\n                  a majority of votes, several more rounds of balloting ensued. In the earliest rounds\n                  of voting,James Shieldswas the highest polling of the Democratic candidates, but when he failed to achieve\n                  a majority after six rounds, the Democrats shifted their votes to Joel A. Matteson\n                  on the seventh ballot.  After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln\n                  dropped out of contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for Trumbull\n                  to prevent Matteson’s election and ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would win\n                  the seat. In the tenth and final round of voting Trumbull received fifty-one votes\n                  and won the senatorship.
