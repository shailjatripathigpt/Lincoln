D.Baker, member ofCongressfor the 6th Congressional District of thisState, was called upon to address the meeting. He responded to the call, and in an address\n\nof an hour’s length, referred to the history of the Hungarians as a people—the fact\n\nthat they had long been the rampart which had prevented the Turk and the Saracen from\n\ncarrying their arms intoEurope—the numbers of her people, which entitled them to all the rights and privileges of\n\na nation—the spirit of freedom, and equality that prevailed among them—their devoted\n\npatriotism—their heroic achievements amid the smouldering ruins of their cities, the\n\ndesolation of their provinces, the savage and ruthless butcheries and barbarities\n\nof Austrian legions and Russian hordes—the belief that even at this moment Hungary\n\nwas a free and independent nation;—but that if not,—ifKossuthand his colleagues had been crushed, the spirit they have evinced, the noble principles\n\nthey had developed, the consecration of them by their exertions and their sacrifices,\n\nwould be felt in all after times in Europe, and though the heads of these patriots\n\nmight be placed upon the gates of cities, they would live in the undying memories\n\nof the hearts of all who appreciated patriotism, regarded the rights of humanity,\n\nand the great and eternal principles of human liberty. The meeting responded to these sentiments with marked enthusiasm. The committee then reported the following resolutions: Resolved, That in their present glorious struggle for liberty, the Hungarians, command\n\nour highest admiration, and have our warmest sympathy. Resolved, That they have our most ardent prayers for their speedy triumph and final\n\nsuccess. Resolved, That the Government of the United States should acknowledge the Independence\n\nof Hungary as^a^Nation of freemen, at the very earliest moment consistent with our amicable relations\n\nwith that Government, against which they are contending. Resolved, That in the opinion of this meeting, the immediate acknowledgment of the\n\nindependence of Hungary by our government, is due from American freeman, to their\n\nstruggling brethren, to the general cause of Republican liberty, and not a violation\n\nof the just rights of any Nation or people. The resolutions were read and adopted by an unanimous vote. On motion of S. Francis, Esq., Resolved, That the officers of this meeting transmit a copy of its proceedings signed by themselves,\n\ntoMr. Clayton, the American Secretary of State, with a request that he will present them to the\n\nAgent of the Hungarian People in United States,CountWaas, that they may be placed in the hands of Kossuth, the President of the Hungarian\n\nRepublic. The meeting then ordered the proceedings to be published in the city papers; and adjourned,\n\ngiving three cheers in honor of Kossuth and Hungary.",

Americans interpreted the\n                  Hungarian struggle  and other revolutionary uprisings convulsing Europe as confirmation\n                  of America’s own experiment with democracy and conviction  that the ideals of liberty\n                  and democracy would soon transform Europe.  Finding parallels between the Hungarian\n                  and theAmericanrevolutions, the American public and press sympathized with Louis Kossuth and his\n                  fellow revolutionaries.  Sympathy for Kossuth and his followers only increased afterAustria, with Russian military assistance, crushed the Hungarian uprising.
