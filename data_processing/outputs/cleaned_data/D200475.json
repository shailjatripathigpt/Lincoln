Abraham Lincoln got David Lincoln’s name from McDowell.David’s response to Abraham, if he penned one, has not been located.  There are no\n                  other known letters between the two, but Abraham Lincoln did make reference to their\n                  brief correspondence in two later letters,onein 1854, and another in 1860.Lincoln’s interest at this time with his paternal ancestry and genealogy also extended\n                  to Lincolns in Massachusetts.
