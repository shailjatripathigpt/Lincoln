Never have theWhigssince their organization as a party been more dismayed than they are at the present\n\ntime; and never since the organization of the government, never in any previous contest\n\nhave we observed more certain indications of success than we now find throughout the\n\nUnion. The Whigs previous to theelection of 1840kept their press fettered and their orators silent. Their principles were unknown,\n\nand their objects indiscoverable, and their entire system of policy a profound mystery\n\nand their great principle and rallying cry opposition to Mr.Van Buren, and a determination to leave no means untriedhowever unfair, to give that opposition the fullest effect. But the extra-session of ’41 and the long session of ’42 disclosed all; they then displayed the cloven foot. And in a manner characteristic\n\nof Whiggery they are doing their utmost to avoid discussion and check investigation\n\ninto the odious measures of that WhigCongress. The recent developments made by Mr.Calhounin the course of the debate, noticed in theRegisterof last week, have stricken terror into all ranks of that party; orators, drummers,\n\n“shingle clappers,” Satraps and pack horses. I do not propose giving an extended view of the discussion, as I should thereby encroach\n\nupon space which might be better employed. I shall content myself by presenting a\n\nsynopsis of Mr. Calhoun’s leading arguments with Mr.Lincoln’s “sneers” at them. Mr. Calhoun’s first speech on Wednesday evening was luminous, convincing andunanswerable. His statements were supported by an array of facts which no man will deny, and\n\nfrom which he deduced arguments, which no Whig in existence, from Mr.Claydownto Mr.Baker,candisprove. In discussing the tariff, Mr. Calhoun proved beyond all cavil that in its operation\n\nthe entire burden fell upon the consumer. He totally annihilated that absurd and\n\nridiculous paradox, so utterly at variance with all experience and common sense:—thathighprices—the necessary consequence of a high tariff—makecheapgoods. Though Mr. Calhoun triumphantly established the first proposition, yet Mr. Lincoln\n\nhad the hardihood to assert that it mightprobablyfall upon the manufacturer, after Mr. Calhoun had shown that itpositivelyfell upon the consumer. Will Mr. L. tell us who paid the duty onDr. Shields’ knives? But this being a fact which hedare notdeny andcannotcontrovert, he passes over with a “sneer!” As to the second: Notwithstanding that it is so superlatively foolish, and carries\n\nwith its own refutation, Mr. Lincoln had the presumption to insult the understandings\n\nof his hearers, by re-asserting that such was the case. Probably hispack-horsemay believe this. The “shingle-clappers” by whom he was surrounded, no doubt, received\n\nit with implicit faith and credit; but what must have been Mr. Lincoln’s opinion of\n\nthe intelligence of his auditory if he expected them to swallow that? If he found\n\nbelievers, it is in vain to argue with such—their ignorance is too prejudiced to be\n\ntaught and their prejudice too contemptible to be combatted: Mr. Lincoln very candidly acknowledged his inability to prove that the tariff had\n\nanything to do with thelatelow prices throughout this country andEurope. I saylatelow prices, because goods arenowrapidly advancing to the standard of oppressive and tyranical extortion contemplated by the framers of that villanous law. As the following table taken from aNew Yorkpaper will show. Prices of cotton goods atBostonand New York in the early part of the year1843,and‘44. Whoever will make the calculation will find an advance in the above prices of from\n\n20 to 58 per cent. This law was passed in 1842, that is one fact.2Goods began to fall about that time, this is another fact, but I defy Mr. L. or\n\nany man living to prove that the relation of cause and effect subsists between them.\n\nThey are merely coincident. The second is by means a consequence of the first. Old women tell us that when a ram turns his tail to the wind, or when a pig is seen\n\nwith a straw in his mouth that these are certain and invariable signs of rain. Now\n\nwill Mr. L. contend that if the rain follows, it is a necessary and inevitable consequence\n\nof the motions of those animals? Yet his argument in support of the tariff is just\n\nas sound; and he has certainly predicated it upon the lessons he received from his\n\nnurse. Whiggery may well exclaim—save me from my friends!
