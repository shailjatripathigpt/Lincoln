A meeting of the Bar of Springfield was held at the Court House on the 20th inst.Judge Loganwas called to the chair, andJ. B. White, appointed Secretary. E. B. Herndon, Esq., arose to state the object of the meeting, and said, Mr.Chairman: It has been my happy fortune to have been a member of the Springfield Bar for the\n\nlast ten years. Much of that time the gentleman, whom we all delight to honor, occupied\n\nthe place from which he is now about to retire.2As a lawyer, as an officer and as a man, amid interests various and sometimes conflicting,\n\nwe have met, but I take great pleasure in stating that nothing has transpired to mar\n\nthat intercourse or render it anything but pleasant and agreeable. The object of this meeting, Mr. Chairman, is that we the members of the Bar in a manner\n\nsuitable to this occasion make public testimonial of our regard for, and appreciation\n\nof the uninform courtesy and gentlemanly bearing of Mr.James H. Mathenyin the discharge of the duties of his office as clerk of thiscourt. To say that he has discharged his official duties with distinguished abilities, is\n\ndoing but meagre justice to his talents; and though I have always found in him a stern, uncompromising\n\npolitical opponent;3yet none has ever suspected him of making discriminations in favor of party frfends. To litigants, witnesses, and lawyers his courtesy, kindness and attention have\n\nbeen extended alike, and equality to all. Mr. Chairman, as a slight testimonial of our appreciation and regard for Mr.Mathenyas an officer, and as a man, I move that the resolutions which I here beg leave to\n\nreport, be read and adopted. Whereas,Jas. H. Matheny, who has for a long period of time, whilst we have been practicing at the Bar of\n\nthe court of which he is clerk, is now about to cease in the discharge of the duties\n\nof that station and unwilling that the relation in which we have so long stood should\n\nalso cease without a proper testimonial of our high appreciation of his worth as a\n\nman and his remarkable efficiency as clerk of this court, therefore, Resolved, That, we as members of the Bar do hereby present him our most hearty thanks for\n\nhis civility and gentlemanly bearing, as shown to us and to the Honorable Court in\n\nthe discharge of the many arduous and harassing duties of his office.4 Resolved, That as he retires from the office of clerk we do most cheerfully invite him to\n\nresume his position among us as a practicing lawyer.5 Resolved, That we do hereby request that his Honor, theJudge, may direct the above preamble and resolutions to be spread upon the records of this\n\ncourt. Resolved, That the above be published in theStateRegisterandIllinoisJournalof thiscity.6 The resolutions were read and unanimously adopted. Mr.Cullommoved that the chair be instructed to present the preamble and resolutions to the\n\nCourt and request that they be spread upon the records of the Court. Adopted. Mr. Cullom then said, “Mr. Chairman; though I am one of the youngest members of this\n\nbar,7yet I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without testifying personally to Mr.\n\nMatheny’s manly courtesy and gentlemanly bearing in the discharge of his official\n\nduties. The esteem we all have for him as a man, is as well known as that esteem\n\nitself is universal. That to Mr. Matheny’s return to the bar, we all, and particularly\n\nthe junior members, give our most hearty welcome. Mr.Lincolnsaid, “This is the first intimation I have had that any such meeting as this was intended.\n\nIt takes me considerably by surprise, particularly as it might be expected that I\n\nam to say something. Much could be said of the man named in the resolutions, and of\n\nhis public services. Indeed, much could be said, which, if said of other men, would\n\nbe sheer flattery, whilst in respect to him it falls far short of the whole truth.\n\nThat I have long esteemed Mr. Matheny as a man and a friend, is known to you all.\n\nBut that I should meet out to you the full measure of his worth, I shall not now attempt\n\nto do. Besides, much of this has already been beautifully and graphically done by\n\nmy friend Mr. Herndon. Mr. Chairman, allow me in conclusion to say that I fully concur\n\nin all that has been said and done on this occasion. The meeting then adjourned, and the Court convened, whereupon Judge Logan arose and\n\nsaid— May it please the Court, I hold in my hand a series of resolutions, unanimously adopted\n\nat a recent meeting of the Bar of this place. I am instructed to present these Resolutions\n\nto your honorable Court, and ask that your honor direct them to be spread upon the\n\nrecords.— The resolutions refer to the dissolution of relations heretofore existing\n\nbetween the Bar and one of its members, serving in another branch of ministerial duty\n\nto this court, and indicates the unwillingness of the Bar that these relations should\n\nbe severed without a just tribute of respect to the officer and to the man. This\n\nis not, however, one of those cases, when the severance is violent and total; when\n\nwe are to meet no more, but is such that we can all take pleasure in uniting in a\n\njust and proper testimonial of our confidence and esteem. I was present at the meeting\n\nand concurred in all that was done, and now I take great pleasure in moving your honor\n\nto direct the resolutions to be spread upon the records of his court. JudgeDavisreplied— I have been upon the bench eight years. At first this court contained fourteen\n\ncounties— it now is somewhat less.8The Clerks in most of these counties were gentlemen of distinguished abilities,\n\nbut none were superior to Mr. Matheny in any of the qualities of officer or man.\n\nThis testimonial of respect and esteem on the part of the Bar, is in every respect\n\nmerited by the man. The court orders the resolutions to be spread upon the records\n\nas requested.",

I am instructed to present these Resolutions\n               to your honorable Court, and ask that your honor direct them to be spread upon the\n               records.— The resolutions refer to the dissolution of relations heretofore existing\n               between the Bar and one of its members, serving in another branch of ministerial duty\n               to this court, and indicates the unwillingness of the Bar that these relations should\n               be severed without a just tribute of respect to the officer and to the man.  This\n               is not, however, one of those cases, when the severance is violent and total; when\n               we are to meet no more, but is such that we can all take pleasure in uniting in a\n               just and proper testimonial of our confidence and esteem.  I was present at the meeting\n               and concurred in all that was done, and now I take great pleasure in moving your honor\n               to direct the resolutions to be spread upon the records of his court."

At first this court contained fourteen\n               counties— it now is somewhat less.8The Clerks in most of these counties were gentlemen of distinguished abilities,\n               but none were superior to Mr. Matheny in any of the qualities of officer or man. \n               This testimonial of respect and esteem on the part of the Bar, is in every respect\n               merited by the man.  The court orders the resolutions to be spread upon the records\n               as requested."
