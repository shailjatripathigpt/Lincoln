        "text": "4Lincoln forwarded aletterMinshall and otherWhigssigned, recommending Hart Fellows for appointment as secretary of theOregon Territory, to Secretary of StateJohn M. Clayton. In his ownletterto Clayton, Lincoln endorsed Fellows as “worthy” of either a judgeship  or appointment\n                  as secretary of the Oregon Territory, but stipulated thatSimeon Franciswas his personal choice for the latter.PresidentZachary TaylorhadappointedLincoln secretary of the Oregon Territory August 9, 1849, less than a month after\n                  he appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront to Whigs inIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln the position of  secretary of\n                  the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. In aletterto Secretary of State Clayton dated August 21, 1849, Lincoln declined the appointment\n                  for secretary of the Oregon Territory and recommended Simeon Francis for the position\n                  instead.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7."

        "text": "5In the end, President Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory. On September 20, 1849, in a final effort to ease\n                  any tensions caused by Butterfield’s appointment, the Taylor administration also offered\n                  Lincoln appointment as governor of the Oregon Territory. After serious consideration\n                  of this offer, Lincoln also declined this position, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Fellows’ name does not appear in the official registers for the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so apparently he did not receive any other\n                  appointment.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:307;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853)."
