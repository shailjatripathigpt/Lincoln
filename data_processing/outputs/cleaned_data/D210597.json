        "text": "3Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into\n                  thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates. He even allowed himself to become\n                  a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.The Illinois General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make\n                  their selection for the state’s U.S. Senator. Thomas R. McClure cast his vote for\n                  Lincoln in all of the first nine rounds of voting. After the ninth vote, with his\n                  share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his remaining\n                  supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. McClure voted for Trumbull\n                  in the tenth round of voting, at which point Trumbull was declared the victor.
