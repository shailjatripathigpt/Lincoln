The Illinois Central Railroad was unpopular among many in Illinois due to its foreclosing\n                  on 4,000 mortgages and its attempts to gain tax exempt status with the State of Illinois.\n                  Douglas stated that in the 1840s he had advocated for a higher tax rate on the railroad\n                  than what the General Assembly enacted, and that it was Lincoln’s faction that got\n                  a lower rate for the Illinois Central Railroad.  He told the audience that he had\n                  convinced the U.S. Senate to provide land grants to the State of Illinois to be used\n                  for rail development instead of giving the grants to the railroad companies, and that\n                  theU.S. House of Representatives, of which Lincoln was a member, had defeated the legislation. Douglas also accused\n                  Lincoln of being  a political tool of the Illinois Central Railroad, referencing a\n                  case where Lincoln received $5,000 to represent the railroad.    Lincoln did represent\n                  the railroad on several cases and received $5000 for a case againstMcLean County. In that case, the railroad paid Lincoln $200 and he sued the company for the remaining\n                  $4,800. Lincoln denied these claims against him in this speech and in a speech at\n                  Pekin on October 5.Allen C.

Lincoln first sat in Congress in December 1847,\n                  after much of the major fighting inMexicohad ended.      As a Whig, Lincoln was critical of the Mexican War as well as of\n                  PresidentJames K. Polk’s role in instigating the conflict, writing a list of resolutions to investigate\n                  the exact spot of the  first shots to determine the validity of the American declaration\n                  of war.  Although Lincoln opposed the war and questioned its constitutionality during\n                  his time in the U.S. House of Representatives, he nevertheless always voted for supplies\n                  for U.S. troops serving in the field.  Douglas refrained from this avenue of attack\n                  on Lincoln, stating on September 20, 1858, ”The fact was this. Lincoln did not vote\n                  against any supplies, for they had been voted before and sent out before Lincoln got\n                  to Congress.”Cong.

He claimed Lincoln helped draft the resolutions and that they constituted\n                  proof that Lincoln was a radicalabolitionist. In reality, the resolutions he read aloud were from an 1854 Illinois Anti-Nebraska convention that was held inAurora, Illinois, in October 1854,  and Lincoln was neither involved in their drafting nor did he\n                  attend the convention. The convention was organized by and composed of delegates who\n                  were much more radical in their politics with regard to slavery than anti-slavery\n                  moderates such as Lincoln. Nevertheless, the convention’s delegates elected Lincoln,\n                  in absentia, to a twelve-member state central committee—something Douglas and other\n                  Democrats seized upon as further proof of Lincoln’s radical abolitionism.Lincoln did not catch Douglas’s misrepresentation of the radical Aurora platform for\n                  the more moderate Springfield platform during the Ottawa debate and therefore did\n                  not correct Douglas at the time, aside from noting that he had not helped create the\n                  platform that Douglas read aloud. During later debates, however, he confronted Douglas\n                  on the issue. Douglas eventually claimed that his mistake was an honest one, even\n                  though he made the same misrepresentation in an 1856 speech in the U.S. Senate (which\n                  Lyman Trumbull took him to task for at the time). Douglas elided personal responsibility\n                  for these false claims through the fall of 1858.First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois; First Debate with Stephen A.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision inScott v. Sandfordexemplified this conspiracy.   “In the first place, what is necessary to make the\n                  institution national?” Lincoln intoned at Ottawa. “Not war. There is no danger that\n                  the people of Kentucky will shoulder their muskets and with a young nigger stuck on\n                  every bayonet march into Illinois and force them upon us.

        "text": "8One of  Lincoln’s arguments in the fourth debate with Douglas  atCharlestonon September 18, 1858 was that Douglas was only in favor of popular sovereignly when\n                  it favored pro-slavery policies. He referenced the removal of a clause in the Toombs\n                  Bill that would require the people of theKansas Territoryto vote on the ratification of the state constitution upon admission to the Union,\n                  which would have almost certainly led to Kansas joining the Union as a free state.On June 23, 1856,Robert A. Toombsannounced his intention of introducing a  bill that would supposedly quell the escalatingpolitical violence in Kansas. The so-called Toombs Bill sought to resolve issues in the Kansas Territory  by formulating\n                  a process for bringing the territory into the union as a new state.  The bill proposed\n                  taking a census of the Kansas Territory’s inhabitants, empowering PresidentFranklin Pierceto appoint five commissioners to ensure that voting integrity existed in the territory,\n                  and authorizing white men over twenty-one years of age residing in the territory to\n                  elect a convention to form a state government.On July 2, the Senate brought the bill up to a vote and a debate on the bill ensued,\n                  during which Trumbull and others proposed multiple amendments. Douglas participated\n                  in this debate. Trumbull argued that because Toombs’s bill stipulated that the Kansas\n                  Territory’s voters be, in effect, re-registered under federal supervision, that the\n                  bill was asserting the right of theU.S. Congressto regulate and govern the territories and would therefore nullify laws which theKansas Territorial Legislaturehad passed related to the management of its own elections. TheKansas-Nebraska Actdid not specify that the U.S. Congress reserved the right to assert its authority\n                  over the territories’ elections. Although the Senate voted to amend the Toombs bill\n                  so that the Kansas Territory’s elections were merely postponed rather than forbidden\n                  until the “complete execution” of the act, Trumbull argued that the bill exposed Douglas\n                  and the Democrats’s hypocrisy on the concept of popular sovereignty. Trumbull proposed\n                  an amendment with language explicitly declaring “all the acts and proceedings” of\n                  the Kansas Territorial Legislature “null and void” as well as an amendment making\n                  it clear that the Kansas Territorial Legislature held the right “at any time to exclude\n                  slavery . . . or to recognize and regulate it therein.” The Senate rejected both of\n                  these amendments.Toombs’s bill passed the Senate, which had a Democratic majority, on  July 2, but\n                  ultimately failed in the U.S. House of Representatives, in which Republicans held\n                  a majority.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 18 September 1858,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-18;  Fourth Debate with Stephen A.

        "text": "Mr.Lincolnlifted himself up and was  about to reply, whenPhilo Reed, a very modest, unassuming young man, told him to sit down and wait till theglee bandhad a chance to spread themselves—which they did to the delight of theRepublicans.2Mr. Lincoln then proceeded.  About the first hour of his speech was taken up with\n               littlesharpsonDouglas, calculated to  tickle the fancy of the Republicans.  He referred to the speech made\n               by Douglas last week, in which he was charged with being the attorney of theIllinois Central Railroad, at the time the charter was granted, to make a good bargain for thecompanyagainst theState—and as having induced thelegislatureto change the per centage from fifteen to seven per cent.  He didn’t deny the charge that he was then or is now the attorney of therailroad, or that he is to-day receiving a big fee from that company as their attorney.3He referred to the bargain between himself andTrumbullto Abolitionize the old lineWhigsandDemocrats, and said it was none of Douglas’ business how he and Trumbull “managed their own domestic concerns.”4He referred to theMexican war, while he was incongressgiving aid and comfort to the enemy, and against his own country, pronouncing it\n               unholy, unconstitutional, God abhorred, and not begun on the right “spot.”5—This portion of his speech he made as clear as mud.  He then harped on the resolutions\n               read atOttawaby Douglas as a forgery because they were not adopted on the right “spot,” but never once said a word about the revolutionary heresies they contained.6He harped over the conspiracy entered, into by Douglas and theSupreme Court,7the submission clause in theToombsbill,8&c[etc], &c, all of which have been [nailed?] and clinched as lies by Douglas time and again.  His whole speech was a personal\n               attack on Douglas and Democrats.  He dodged the issues before the people, and failed\n               entirely to discuss the principles dividing the two parties.  It was not marked by\n               the “abilities of a Statesman, or the dignity of a would be Senator,” and was coldly\n               received by the small crowd present.9"
