The fine steamerEditor, Capt Garrett,2gaily decorated with banners, and bearing a huge inscription on her pilot house,\n\n“For Senator,Abraham Lincoln,” arrived at our levee yesterday afternoon.Douglaswas inveighing against Negro Equality, and telling us what a blessing theDred Scott decisionis, when the whistle of theEditorsouned half a mile down theriver. Forthwith some five hundred persons broke away from the Dred Scott oration, and\n\nscattered to the landing. When the boat touched the shore three cheers were called\n\nfor, and given with a vengeance, for Abraham Lincoln.3Mr. Lincoln was greeted by a host of friends from different parts of Mason andFultoncounties, who had come to hear him reply to the amalgamation lecture which Douglas\n\nhas been reading all over theState.4Several of the old stagers of the company which Lincoln raised and commanded in\n\ntheBlack Hawk war, were present, and joined in the general greeting.5A procession of carriages was then formed, and Mr. Lincoln was escorted through\n\nthe principal streets to the residence ofFrancis Low, Esq. Several persons suggested the propriety of his going to the grove and hearing the\n\nremainder of Douglas’ fables. “No,” said Lincoln, “theJudgefelt so ‘put out’ by my listening to him atBloomingtonandClinton, that I promised to let him alone for the rest of thecanvass. I understand he is callingTrumbulland myself liars, and if he saw me in the crowd he might be so ashamed of himself\n\nas to omit the most vivid part of this argument.”6 Judge Kellogg also arrived here last evening to keep his and Lincoln’s appointment\n\nat the Mason County Convention to-day.7This afternoon the finest Republican rally we ever witnessed in this section, came\n\noff in the grove just north of thetown. Fully two thousand persons were present—including delegations fromBath,Spring Lake,Chandlerville, (Cass Co.,) and various parts of Fulton county. Mr. Lincoln was introduced to the audience\n\nat precisely two o’clock, and received three rousing cheers. He said that before\n\npursuing the line of argument which he had marked out for the day, he would call the\n\nattention of his audience to the matters between himself and Judge Douglas, which\n\nhe he thought would probably answer them. A QUESTION OF MUSCLE. “I am informed, (said he,)that my distinguishedfriendyesterday became a little excited, nervous, perhaps,(laughter)and he said something aboutfighting, as though referring to a pugilistic encounter between him and myself. Did anybody\n\nin this audience hear him use such language?(Cries of yes.)I am informed, further, that somebody inhisaudience, rather more excited, or nervous, than himself, took off his coat, and offered\n\nto take the job off Judge Douglas’ hands, and fight Lincoln himself. Did anybody\n\nhere witness that warlike proceeding?8(Laughter, and cries of yes.)Well, I merely desire to say that I shall fight neither Judge Douglas nor his second.(Great laughter.)I shall not do this for two reasons, which I will now explain. In the first place,\n\na fight wouldprovenothing which is in issue in thiscontest. It might establish that Judge Douglas is a more muscular man than myself, or it\n\nmight demonstrate that I am a more muscular man than Judge Douglas. But this question\n\nis not referred to in theCincinnati platform, nor in either of the Springfield platforms.9(Great laughter.)Neither result would prove him right or me wrong. And so of the gentleman who volunteered\n\nto do his fighting for him. If my fighting Judge Douglas would not prove anything,\n\nit would certainly prove nothing for me to fight his bottle-holder.(Continued laughter.) “My second reason for not having a personal encounter with the Judge is, that I don’t\n\nbelieve he wants it himself.(Laughter.)He and I are about the best friends in the world, and when we get together he would\n\nno more think of fighting me than of fighting hiswife. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, when the Judge talked about fighting, he was not\n\ngiving vent to any ill-feeling of his own, but merely trying to excite—well,enthusiasmagainst me on the part of his audience. And as I find he was tolerably successful,\n\nwe will call it quits.” (Cheers and laughter.) “TWO UPON ONE.” “One other matter of trifling consequence,” continued Mr. Lincoln, “and I will proceed. I understand that Judge Douglas yesterday referred to the fact\n\nthat both Judge Trumbull and myself are making speeches throughout the State to beat\n\nhim for theSenate, and that he tried to create a sympathy by the suggestion that this was playingtwo upon oneagainst him. It is true that Judge Trumbull has made a speech inChicago, and I believe he intends to co-operate with theRepublican Central Committeein their arrangements for the campaign to the extent of making other speeches in\n\ndifferent parts of the State.10Judge Trumbull is a Republican, like myself, and he naturally feels a lively interest\n\nin the success of hisparty. Is there anything wrong about that? But I will show you how little Judge Douglas’s\n\nappeal to your sympathies amounts to. At the next general election, two years from\n\nnow, aLegislaturewill be elected which will have to choose a successor to Judge Trumbull.11Of course there will be an effort to fill his place with aDemocrat. This person, whoever he may be, is probably out making stump-speeches against me,\n\njust as Judge Douglas is. It may be one of the present Democratic members of thelower house of Congress—but whoever he is, I can tell you he has got to make some stump speeches now, or\n\nhis party will not nominate him for the seat occupied by Judge Trumbull. Well, are\n\nnot Judge Douglas and this man playingtwo upon oneagainst me, just as much as Judge Trumbull and I are playingtwo upon oneagainst Judge Douglas?(Laughter.)And if it happens that there are two Democratic aspirants for Judge Trumbull’s place,\n\nare they not playingthree upon oneagainst me, just as we are playingtwo upon oneagainst Judge Douglas?12(Renewed laughter.) Mr. Lincoln then made a most effective speech of two hours in length, which was loudly\n\nand enthusiastically applauded. I can give an idea of its power by telling some of\n\nits effects. A delegation of Old LineWhigswho voted theFillmoreticket in1856, came up from Bath expressly to hear Mr. Lincoln. They had been told by the Douglas\n\nprints that there were only two planks in his platform—negro equality and amalgamation.\n\nThey learned that he not only had never advocated either of these doctrines, but that\n\nthe fact of Douglas’s being unable to assail him in any of hisrealpositions, was the sole reason of his creating these fictitious and disgusting issues.\n\nThey learned that in the conspiracy to Africanize the American continent, Stephen\n\nA. Douglas was the arch-conspirator—theCatilineof the cabal. Thist hey learned not from the bare say-so of Mr. Lincoln, but from a mountain of evidence.13They learned enough things from the exercises of the day to give three rousing cheers\n\nfor Abe Lincoln—enough to go home and set theirtownin order for a rousing majority for “Old Abe” in November. After the speeches were\n\nover they called on him and gave him an earnest invitation to go to Bath and speak\n\non Monday—engaging to carry him over toLewistonin time to fill his appointment in thatplaceon Tuesday. I am glad to learn that Mr. Lincoln accepted the invitation.14This is only one case of our complete success to-day. Large numbers from the eastern part of thecountyjoined in the general acclaim. I cannot say that Lincoln brought back anyFremontRepublicans who were inclined to go for Douglas, for the reason of there being none\n\nof that class in the good county of Mason.15",

According to\n                  some news reports, Lincoln arrived by boat as Douglas was speaking and a significant\n                  portion of the crowd departed Douglas’s address to welcome Lincoln. Lincoln delivered\n                  his speech in Havana the next day, August 14.At the time, Lincoln was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace Douglas, the incumbent, in the U.S. Senate.\n                  He and Douglas both canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for\n                  theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the state’s race for the U.S. Senate seat.\n                  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Throughout the 1858 campaign season, Douglas devoted significant attention to theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision inScott v. Sandford, popularly known as the Dred Scott decision. He criticized Lincoln and other Republicans\n                  for their outrage over the decision. Lincoln addressed the court’s ruling from the\n                  day the Republican Party nominated him as its candidate for the U.S. Senate—in his\n                  famous “House Divided” speech. He also asserted throughout the campaign of 1858, including\n                  during theLincoln-Douglas Debates, that the Dred Scott decision signaled a desire on the part of pro-slavery Democrats\n                  to nationalize slavery.Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 21 July 1858, 2:1;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 20 August 1858, 2:2-3;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 13 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-13; 14 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-14;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 20 August 1858, 2:3-4; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

These were charges Lincoln\n                  routinely denied. During the first Lincoln-Douglas Debate, for instance, he asserted\n                  that although he believed  the Declaration of Independence applied to all men—rather\n                  than just white men—he did not favor full social and political equality between the\n                  races, nor did he intend to abolish slavery. One of his most renowned counters to\n                  Douglas’s accusations regarding amalgamation and interracial marriage was his statement,\n                  “I protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic which presumes that because\n                  I did not want a negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her for a wife.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:439-41, 468, 501, 506, 510-11;Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 19 July 1858, 2:4-6, 3:1-5; First Debate with Stephen A.

Lincoln was present.\n                  According to newspaper reports, after Douglas finished speaking some members of the\n                  audience called for Lincoln to speak. Lincoln reportedly told the crowd that since\n                  the gathering was organized specifically for Douglas, “it would be improper for me\n                  to address it.” Lincoln did not deliver an address in Bloomington until September\n                  4.Douglas spoke in Clinton, Illinois, on July 27. Lincoln was present and delivered\n                  an address at the Clinton courthouse later than evening. For a time, Lincoln had followed\n                  Douglas on the campaign trail, delivering speeches either later in the evening after\n                  Douglas finished, or the next day. This posed challenges, however, as many spectators\n                  were unwilling to devote long hours or days to campaign events. Democrats also attacked\n                  Lincoln as “desperate” for following in Douglas’s footsteps. On July 24, Lincoln challenged\n                  Douglas to a series of formal debates. Douglas agreed, and these became the Lincoln-Douglas\n                  Debates.When Douglas gave his August 13 speech in Havana, he responded angrily to Lincoln’s\n                  accusation that he was part of a pro-slavery conspiracy to nationalize slavery and\n                  to Lyman Trumbull’s criticism of him as a hypocrite for opposing theLecompton Constitution. Douglas called both Lincoln and Trumbull “liars” and “wretches,” among other things.Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 15 July 1858, 2:2; 30 July 1858, 2:1-2;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 27 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-27; 4 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-04; Report of Speech at Bloomington, Illinois; Report of Speech at Clinton, Illinois;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.

At the time, he was more well known than Lincoln and was considered\n                  a more able speaker, so Republicans were grateful for his efforts on behalf of the\n                  party. Douglas often criticized Trumbull, a former Democrat, for allying with the\n                  Republicans in general and for aiding Lincoln specifically. One of Douglas’s claims\n                  was that Lincoln and Trumbull were conspiring to make both the Democratic and the\n                  Republican parties abolitionist parties.Trumbull delivered a speech in Chicago, Illinois, on August 7 in which he criticized\n                  pro-slavery forces, the Democratic Party, and Douglas for the passage of theKansas-Nebraska Act, efforts to pass the Lecompton Constitution, the Dred Scott decision, and increased\n                  public expenditures.

They had been told by the Douglas\n               prints that there were only two planks in his platform—negro equality and amalgamation.\n               They learned that he not only had never advocated either of these doctrines, but that\n               the fact of Douglas’s being unable to assail him in any of hisrealpositions, was the sole reason of his creating these fictitious and disgusting issues.\n               They learned that in the conspiracy to Africanize the American continent, Stephen\n               A.

After the speeches were\n               over they called on him and gave him an earnest invitation to go to Bath and speak\n               on Monday—engaging to carry him over toLewistonin time to fill his appointment in thatplaceon Tuesday.
