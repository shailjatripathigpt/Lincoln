        "text": "2Lincoln is referring to the recent split of the Democratic Party into pro-Stephen\n                  A. Douglas and pro-James Buchananfactions. The split occurred after Douglas, in December 1857,  spoke out against\n                  theLecompton Constitutionand criticized President Buchanan for supporting it. Although Douglas later denied\n                  it, he intimated in correspondence and in meetings that he was finished with the Democratic\n                  Party. He also actively courted political support fromRepublicansin an effort to bolster his chances of reelection to theU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Election.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-48."

        "text": "3This is a reference to a congressional bill proposed by William H. English and others\n                  in the spring of 1858. The so-called English bill proposed sending the Lecompton Constitution\n                  back to the voters of theKansas Territorywith a modification to the territory’s request for a federal land grant—reduced to\n                  4 million acres from the requested 23 million acres. In essence, the bill offered\n                  Kansas voters statehood in exchange for accepting slavery. If Kansas voters rejected\n                  the offer, the English bill stipulated that the territory could not reapply for statehood\n                  until a census showed it possessed a population of at least 90,000 people.Douglas considered supporting the bill, but ultimately opposed it. The bill passed\n                  both the U.S. Senate and theU.S. House of Representativeson April 30, and President Buchanan signed it into law. On August 2, Kansans overwhelmingly\n                  rejected this Lecompton Constitution-cum-land grant by a vote of 11,300 to 1,788.David M. Potter and Don E. Fehrenbacher,The Impending Crisis, 1848-1861(New York: Harper & Row, 1976), 323-25."
