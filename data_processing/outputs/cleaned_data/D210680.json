Edgar, Coles, and Vermilion counties were all part of the Eighteenth Illinois Senatorial\n                  District. However, those counties were not in the same stateHousedistrict. Coles County was in the Twenty-fifth House District, Edgar County in the\n                  Twenty-fourth, and Vermilion County in the Thirty-Seventh District. In hisletterof April 23, 1858, Abraham Lincoln asked Marshall, Rives, and Davis to collaborate\n                  to find a candidate to run for theIllinois Senatein the Eighteenth District.  Lincoln was looking for supporters to assist him in\n                  his candidacy for the U.S. Senate.   At the time, state legislatures chose members\n                  of the U.S. Senate.  In the end, Marshall became the candidate and won the seat.Abraham Lincoln to Thomas A. Marshall; Allen C.

Fremontas their first presidential candidate, Democrats nominatedJames Buchanan, and theAmerican Party, in its final participation in a presidential election, nominated Millard Fillmore.\n                  Lincoln and the Republicans, concerned about having two opposition parties, attempted\n                  to work together with the American Party to defeat Buchanan.
