        "text": "1The issue over the pay of Cass and Taylor rose within the context of thepresidential campaign of 1848.  As the campaign grew more heated,WhigsandDemocratslabored to impugn the character of their respective opponents.  On June 26 and again\n                  on August 3, 1848, RepresentativeAndrew Stewartaccused Cass of obtaining $64,865.46 in extra pay while serving in various government\n                  offices, in stark comparison to Taylor, who, according to Stewart, received no extra\n                  pay. RepresentativeRobert McClellandand other Democrats worked to refute Stewart’s charges and pointed an accusing finger\n                  at Taylor, claiming he  \n                  received over $70,000 in extra pay allowances.On July 17, 1848, the House of Representatives adopted aresolutioncalling on President James K. Polk to inform the House how much public money Cass\n                  and Taylor had received since their first entrance into public service, distinguishing\n                  between regular and extra compensation.  On August 11, President Polk submitted the\n                  requested materials to the House, and the House referred them to the Committee on\n                  the Expenditures of the War Department, of which Abraham Lincoln was a member.The House refused Lincoln’s motion to suspend the rules.  There is a discrepancy between\n                  the HouseJournaland theCongressional Globeon the vote:  the HouseJournalhad the vote as seventy-six yeas to seventy-six nays, meaning the motion failed,\n                  the necessary two-thirds not voting in favor, while theCongressional Globerecorded the vote as  seventy-five yeas and seventy-eight nays.Andrew Stewart,Gen.
