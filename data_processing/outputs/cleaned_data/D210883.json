        "text": "2Lincoln delivered a speech in Springfield, Illinois, on July 17, 1858, roughly a month\n                  after the members of theIllinoisRepublican Party nominated him as their candidate to replaceDemocraticincumbent Stephen A. Douglas as Illinois’s representative in theU.S. Senate. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election. Many hailed Lincoln’s speech as an effective rebuttal of Douglas’s racial demagoguery.\n                  TheIllinois State Journalpublished the speech. Lincoln also arranged for his speech to be published in pamphlet\n                  form earlier in August, and he personally sent copies of the pamphlet out for distribution.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 474-75; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois;Abraham Lincoln to Gustave P.

        "text": "3There is no evidence that Lincoln replied to this letter. In fact, the docketing he\n                  wrote on the right side of the envelope for this letter—shown in the third image—indicates\n                  that he decided not to respond.Lincoln delivered an address in Petersburg, Illinois, on October 29. Despite his efforts,\n                  however, in Illinois’s local elections of 1858 Menard County’s voters sent DemocratSamuel W. Fullerto theIllinois Senateand DemocratWilliam Engleto theIllinois House of Representatives. At the time, members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, so  the races\n                  for the Illinois House and Illinois Senate were highly relevant to the outcome of\n                  theracefor the U.S. Senate.In the final results tally, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast during Illinois’s\n                  local elections, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly and Douglas eventually won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through thecampaign, however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Allen C.
