        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Jonas has not been located, but was likely similar to\n                  others Lincoln wrote in November 1854 requesting his allies’ help in canvassing their\n                  localIllinois General Assemblymembers for support of his potential candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate.\n                  Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. U.S. senators were chosen at this time by the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  thus Lincoln’s interest in gauging the members’ political leanings.Abraham Lincoln to Charles Hoyt;Abraham Lincoln to J.

However, in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election\n                  to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
