Our friends in old Tazewell\n               are confident of victory, and after spending a day with them and witnessing the feeling\n               which prevails, we confess that we are highly gratified at the prospect there. Tazewell\n               county may be set down as entirely safe. Cullom will be elected by 600 majority."
