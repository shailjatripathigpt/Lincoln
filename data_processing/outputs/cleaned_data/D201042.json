        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote this fragment.The actual date of this fragment is unknown. When gifting the fragment to the Duchess\n                  of St. Albans in September 1892,Robert Todd Lincolnnoted that the fragment was “a note made in preparing for one of the speeches in\n                  thejoint-debate campaignbetween Mr.Douglas& myfatherin 1858.” Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, speculated that Robert Todd Lincoln separated the fragment from a speech manuscript\n                  that Abraham Lincoln prepared during thesenatorial campaign of 1858. Although some general ideas regarding public service that are present in the fragment\n                  also appear in Lincoln’s remarks in the seventh iteration of theLincoln-Douglas Debates, the text in the fragment does not appear verbatim in any of the press coverage of\n                  Lincoln’s remarks in any of the seven debates.Basler dated this fragment July 1858. However, it is possible that Lincoln wrote the\n                  fragment at any point between the time he challenged Stephen A. Douglas to the debates\n                  in late-July 1858 and the seventh and final debate on October 15, 1858. Therefore,\n                  the editors date this fragment sometime between July and October 1858.Other fragments and notes written by Lincoln and thought to be potentially related\n                  to his preparations for the Lincoln-Douglas Debates include:Definition of Democracy; Fragment of Notes for Debates; Fragment of Notes for Speeches; Notes for the Debate at Jonesboro, Illinois;Fragment of Notes on Pro-slavery Theology; Fragment of a Speech on Slavery.Emanuel Hertz,Abraham Lincoln: A New Portrait(New York: Horace Liveright, 1931), 2:705-6; Roy P.
