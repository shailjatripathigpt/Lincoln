Speed, the “fatal first of Jany[January] 41[1841].” Lincoln spent several hours each of\n                  those days receiving treatment from Anson G. Henry.  His condition was common knowledge\n                  among his colleagues, as indicated in a letter fromMartinette McKeetoJohn J. Hardin, written on January 22: “We have been very much distressed, on Mr. Lincoln’s account,\n                  hearing that he had two Cat fits and a Duck fit since we left.”Martinette McKee to John J.
