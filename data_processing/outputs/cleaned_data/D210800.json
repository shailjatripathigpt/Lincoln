Talcott et al.In the case, brothers Jonathan Haines andAnsel HainessuedWait Talcott, along with the other surviving representatives of Manny and Company, for infringement\n                  upon a patent for a reaper (a kind of harvesting machine). The Haines brothers retained\n                  Lincoln, who launched the case in July 1858.The last correspondence that has been located between Haines and Lincoln related to\n                  this case prior to this July 26 letter is dated March 27, 1858, and, in thatletter, Lincoln does not mention meeting during the first week in August to prepare for\n                  the case. Therefore, if Lincoln and Haines arranged via correspondence to meet during\n                  the first week in August, that correspondence has not been located.Haines & Haines v.

Lincoln and the Haines brothers corresponded at\n                  least four more times regarding this case. Lincoln also corresponded with other individuals\n                  regarding this case at least five times.Lincoln wrotePeter H. Watson, the attorney for Talcott, requesting that they try the case in separate pieces.\n                  Watson refused. The trial was delayed because both sides needed to take depositions.\n                  No additional correspondence related to the case has been located beyond October 1859.\n                  Lincoln most likely represented the Haines’ interests until he was elected president\n                  in the1860 Federal Election, but the outcome of the case is unknown.In the fall of 1856, Jonathan Haines had also suedGeorge H. Ruggin a separate case for infringing on his reaper patent and Lincoln also represented\n                  him in that suit.
