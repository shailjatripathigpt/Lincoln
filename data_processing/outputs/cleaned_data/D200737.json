        "text": "2Lincoln references a lawsuit between the Harris Lime Rock Company and Samuel B. Harris.\n                  In 1852, the Harris Lime Rock Company, an incorporated company inRhode Island, retained Lincoln and William D. Briggs and sued Samuel B. Harris, an agent of the\n                  company, in an action of trespass on the case on promises (assumpsit) in theTazewell County Circuit Courtfor $15,000 that Harris had received as an agent of the company.   Harris owned two\n                  farm lots nearDelavan, Illinois, and the company had them attached.  Attachment involved a legal action through which\n                  a plaintiff could have the court seize the defendant’s personal or real property pending\n                  the outcome of a case involving a debt of $20 or more or an out-of-state defendant;\n                  creditors frequently used attachment against debtors, in many cases in aid to an Assumpsit\n                  action. Assumpsit involved a legal  action for the breach of a simple contract (express\n                  or implied), which was not under seal. Virtually synonymous with trespass on the case\n                  on promises, Assumpsit was used in a wide variety of situations and was the most commonly\n                  used common law action in antebellumIllinois.“Attachment”; “Assumpsit,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

Lincoln makes special reference\n                  to provisions for depositions of non-Illinois residents.  Samuel B. Harris was a resident\n                  ofProvidence, Rhode Island.

Harris failed to appear,\n                  the court ruled for the company, and a  jury awarded the company $5,000 in damages.The Harris Lime Rock Company bought the two farm lots, owned by Harris, at a public\n                  sale to satisfy Harris’ debt.  Before the execution, Harris deeded the lots to his\n                  sons to hide his property from creditors.  Harris Lime Rock Company again retained\n                  Lincoln and in October 1855, sued Harris in the Tazewell County Circuit Court to cancel\n                  the fraudulent deeds.  Harris defaulted, but later appeared.  Harris motioned the\n                  court to set aside the default, and the court granted the motion.  Apparently, the\n                  parties reached a settlement, and in September 1856, the company dismissed the case.Judge’s Docket, Document ID: 46417; Order, Document ID: 46414, 46415,Harris Lime Rock Co. v.
