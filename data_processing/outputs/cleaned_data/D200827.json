Washburne was among those assisting Lincoln.  WashburnewroteLincoln on December 12, that an unspecified friend from Winnebago County opposed\n                  Lincoln’s candidacy because Lincoln was from Springfield.  “The objection to you is\n                  that it is alledged that the Springfield influence has always been against us in the\n                  north, and that if you should be elected the north would be overlooked for the center\n                  and south part of the State.”David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.
