        "text": "6Willard references the movement to elect Abraham Lincoln to theU.S. Senate. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into theelection campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible replacement  forJames Shields, the incumbent, in the Senate. Lincoln won a seat in theIllinois House of Representatives, but in late-November he declined to serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately,\n                  Lincoln  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected\n                  anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
