        "text": "2The original note in Abraham Lincoln's hand is not extant.  Two versions of the note\n                  exist: ahandwritten transcriptioninNorman B. Judd's hand, and aprinted versionthat appears in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates Scrapbook.In June 1858, theIllinois Republican ConventionnominatedAbraham Lincolnto challengeStephen A. Douglasfor theU.S. Senate. With this invitation, Lincoln set the stage for what would become one of the most\n                  famous local political contests in U.S. history and a precursor to the1860 presidential election. Prior to theseven debatesbetween Lincoln and Douglas, Lincoln had already made sixty-three speeches in 1858,\n                  and Douglas claimed to have made 130. Douglas, the incumbent, was more widely known\n                  than Lincoln and had the numeric advantage of theDemocratsin theIllinois General Assembly, which selected U.S. senators in those days. He also represented a divided party\n                  and faced a growing population in northern Illinois that was hostile to slavery. Lincoln,\n                  on the other hand, had the advantage of a unitedRepublicanparty, a growing antipathy toward slavery in thestate, and a reputation for integrity. Nevertheless, his views on racial issues were unpopular,\n                  as was his stand on theMexican War. The debates would highlight the fundamental differences in the men’s characters\n                  and focus on the main issues of the day, the expansion of slavery and racial equality.\n                  While the immediate effect of the debates was the reelection of Douglas, the long-term\n                  results were the opposite. Lincoln was catapulted to national prominence, allowing\n                  him to run for president in 1860, and Douglas’s campaign against Lincoln diminished\n                  his chances of future success.

        "text": "4Douglas makes a veiled reference to  the recent split of the Democratic Party into\n                  pro-James Buchananand pro-Douglas factions. The split occurred after Douglas, in December 1857,  spoke\n                  out against theLecompton Constitutionand criticized President Buchanan for supporting it.  SeeBleeding Kansas.This accusation of Douglas that Lincoln had found a Buchanan/National Democratic candidate\n                  and would insist on his inclusion in the proposed debates was pure fiction. A rumor\n                  of the possibility of the candidacy ofSidney Breesedid appear in several Republican newspapers, but Lincoln had no connection to the\n                  idea. Understandably, Douglas was actively trying to avoid being labeled a coward,\n                  as the RepublicanChicago Daily Press and Tribuneseemed primed to do. In its July 26 edition, thePressnoted that such debates between political opponents, “is the usual, almost universal\n                  western style of conducting a political campaign, and it has been justly held that\n                  the candidate who refused to speak in that way had no better reason than cowardice\n                  for declining the challenge.” Lincolndeniedthe accusation in his response to Douglas.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445, 484;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 21 July 1858, 1:7;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 26 July 1858, 1:1; 4 August 1858, 2:5."

He wrote, “It\n                  may have been well known to you that you went to Springfield for the purpose of agreeing\n                  on the plan of campaign; but it was not so known to me–”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:484;The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 4 August 1858, 4:5."

The Lincoln-supportingChicago Daily Press and Tribuneresponded to the schedule by writing, “The little dodger shirks, and backs out, except\n                  at half a dozen places which he himself selects!” The paper also claimed Douglas to\n                  be afraid of “Long Abe,” which was why “he refuses to meet his antagonist, save in\n                  a few places, far apart, where the gatherings will be too large and too noisy to listen\n                  to argument or see the damage he is sure to sustain in a political encounter with\n                  the long Kentuckian.” A disappointedDaily Illinois State Journalhad hoped for a wider canvass for the candidates to debate each other, but concluded\n                  that Douglas’s proposed meetings would be “better than nothing.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:484;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 28 July 1858, 1:1;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 29 July 1858, 2:2."
