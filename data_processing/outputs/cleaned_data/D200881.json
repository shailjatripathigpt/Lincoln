Caton on March 24, 1856 enclosing the record for an unidentified\n                  case inDeWitt County Circuit Courtand requesting a writ of error and a supersedeas upon his bond with himself as surety.\n                  In American law, a writ of error describes a misapplication or misconception of the\n                  law by the court as grounds for review by an appellate court. A supersedeas is a writ\n                  issued by a superior court ordering an  inferior court to suspend  legal proceedings\n                  in a particular case. No further correspondence between Lincoln and either Moore or\n                  Caton on this subject has been located, nor has the case record enclosed by Moore\n                  to Caton.Lincoln recommended Moore as surety, Martha L.
