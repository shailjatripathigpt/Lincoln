In order to avoid an arrest for\n                  duelling, Lincoln soon left again, placing these instructions withMerryman.

In 1842, the concept\n                  was revived in a series of letters purporting to be from a woman named “Rebecca” from\n                  the Lost Townships. The first, dated August 10, 1842 and published on August 19, bemoaned\n                  the failure of theState Bank of Illinoisand the subsequent depreciation of its printed paper money. Thesecondletter from “Rebecca” was written by Abraham Lincoln on August 27 and published in\n                  theJournalon September 2.
