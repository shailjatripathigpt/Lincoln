If her deceased\n                  husband had no children, the widow received outright ownership of one-half of the\n                  estate.This land would have become part of the right of dower to which Mary Lincoln was entitled,\n                  should she be widowed, but she relinquished her claim of right of dower with this\n                  section of the deed.“Dower,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
