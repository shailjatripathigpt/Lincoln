        "text": "3No additional correspondence between Lincoln and Thomson R. Webber has been located.\n                  However, in aletterdated October 3, 1853, Lincoln noted that no one had retained his services in relation\n                  to the suit. In aletterdated October 7, 1853,Mason Brayman, an attorney for the Illinois Central Railroad, noted that the “failure of the other\n                  parties to retain you” meant that he could offer Lincoln a retainer fee of $250 on\n                  behalf of the railroad company, which Brayman sent.Although it is unclear precisely when Lincoln  first worked for the Illinois Central\n                  Railroad, he represented the company at least as early as May 1853, in the caseIllinois Central Railroad v. McGinnis. Before the railroad officially retained Lincoln for the case discussed in this letter,\n                  however, it sued McLean County for an injunction to stop the county from selling railroad\n                  land to pay taxes. This case was known asIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parke.In late-September 1853, the parties reached an agreement, in which theMcLean County Circuit Courtwould dismiss the bill, thus ruling for McLean County, and the railroad would appeal\n                  the case to theIllinois Supreme Court, where the only question would be whether the county had a lawful right to tax the\n                  Illinois Central Railroad’s property.  Lincoln represented the railroad in this case,\n                  which began in December 1853.In December 1855, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the McLean County\n                  Circuit Court, and  JusticeWalter B. Scatesruled that the Illinois General Assembly could exempt property from taxation.  Therefore,\n                  the Illinois Central Railroad’s charter was constitutional.  Lincoln received $5,000\n                  for his legal services, although he had to sue the railroad in 1857 to collect the\n                  fee.At the request of Brayman, Lincoln had declined new cases against the railroad that\n                  came his way between 1853 and 1855, passing at least some on toJohn T. Stuartand therefore lost opportunities to earn at least some legal fees as a direct result\n                  of his employment for the railroad.Illinois Central RR v.
