    "full_text": "Summary of Speech at Worcester, Massachusetts, 12 September 18481 Mr.Kelloggthen introduced to the meeting the Hon.Abram Lincoln,whigmember ofCongressfromIllinois, a representative offree soil. Mr.Lincolnhas a very tall and thin figure, with an intellectual face, showing a searching mind,\n\nand a cool judgment. He spoke in a clear and cool, and very eloquent manner, for\n\nan hour and a half, carrying the audience with him in his able arguments and brilliant\n\nillustrations—only interrupted by warm and frequent applause. He began by expressing\n\na real feeling of modesty in addressing an audience “this side of the mountains,”\n\na part of the country where, in the opinion of the people of his section, everybody\n\nwas supposed to be instructed and wise. But he had devoted his attention to the question\n\nof the comingPresidential election, and was not unwilling to exchange with all whom he might meet the ideas to which\n\nhe had arrived. He then began to show the fallacy of some of the arguments againstGen. Taylor, making his chief theme the fashionable statement of all those who oppose him, (“the\n\noldLocofocosas well as the new”) that hehas no principles, and that the whig party have abandoned their principles by adopting him as their\n\ncandidate.2He maintained that Gen. Taylor occupied a high and unexceptionable whig ground,\n\nand took for his first instance and proof of this his statement in the Allison letter—with\n\nregard to the Bank, Tariff, Rivers and Harbors, &c.—that the will of the people should produce its own results, without Executive influence.3The principle that the people should do what—under the constitution—they please,\n\nis a whig principle. All that Gen. Taylor does is not only to consent, but to appeal\n\nto the people to judge and act for themselves. And this was no new doctrine for Whigs.\n\nIt was the “platform” on which they had fought all their battles, the resistance of\n\nExecutive influence, and the principle of enabling the people to frame the government\n\naccording to their will. Gen. Taylor consents to be the candidate, and to assist\n\nthe people to do what they think to be their duty, and think to be best in their natural\n\naffairs, but becausehe don’t want to tell what we ought to do, he is accused of having no principles The Whigs here maintained for years that neither the influence, the duress, or the\n\nprohibition of the Executive should control the legitimately expressed will of the\n\npeople; and now that on that very ground, Gen. Taylor says that he should use the\n\npower given him by the people to do, to the best of his judgment, the will of the\n\npeople, he is accused of want of principle, and of inconsistency in position.4 Mr. Lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an attempt to make a platform or\n\ncreed for a national party, toallparts of whichallmust consent and agree, when it was clearly the intention and the true philosophy\n\nof our government, that in Congress all opinions and principles should be represented,\n\nand that when the wisdom of all had been compared and united, the will of the majority\n\nshould be carried out. On this ground he conceived (and the audience seemed to go\n\nwith him) that General Taylor held correct, sound republican principles. Mr. Lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the States, saying that the people\n\nof Illinois agreed entirely with the people ofMassachusettson this subject, except perhaps that they did not keep so constantly thinking about\n\nit. All agreed that slavery was an evil, but that we were not responsible for it\n\nand cannot affect it in States of this Union where we do not live. But, the question\n\nof theextensionof slavery to new territories of this country, is a part of our responsibility and\n\ncare, and is under our control. In opposition to this Mr. L. believed that the\n\nself named “Free Soil” party, was far behind the Whigs.5Both parties opposed the extension. As he understood it the new party had no principle\n\nexcept this opposition. If their platform held any other, it was in such a general\n\nway that it was like the pair of pantaloons the Yankee pedler offered for sale, “large\n\nenough for any man, small enough for any boy.” They therefore had taken a position\n\ncalculated to break down their single important declared object. They were working\n\nfor the election of eitherGen. Cassor Gen. Taylor. The Speaker then went on to show, clearly and eloquently, the danger of extension\n\nof slavery, likely to result from the election of General Cass. To unite with those\n\nwho annexed the new territory to prevent the extension of slavery in that territory\n\nseemed to him to be in the highest degree absurd and ridiculous. Suppose these gentlemen\n\nsucceed in electing Mr.Van Buren, they had no specific means topreventthe extension of slavery toNew MexicoandCalifornia, and Gen. Taylor, he confidently believed, would not encourage it, and would not\n\nprohibit its restriction. But if Gen. Cass was elected, he felt certain that the\n\nplans of farther extension of territory would be encouraged, and those of the extension\n\nof slavery would meet no check.6 The “Free Soil” men in claiming that name indirectly attempted a deception, by implying\n\nthat Whigs werenotFree Soil men. In declaring that they would “do their duty and leave the consequences\n\nto God,” merely gave an excuse for taking a course that they were not able to maintain\n\nby a fair and full argument. To make this declaration did not show what their duty\n\nwas. If it did we should have no use for judgment, we might as well be made without\n\nintellect, and when divine or human law does not clearly point out whatisour duty, we have no means of finding out what it is by using our most intelligent\n\njudgment of the consequences. If there were divine law, or human law for voting for\n\nMartin Van Buren, or if a fair examination of the consequences and first reasoning\n\nwould show that voting for him would bring about the ends they pretended to wish—then\n\nhe would give up the argument. But since there was no fixed law on the subject, and\n\nsince the whole probable result of their action would be an assistance in electing\n\nGen.Cass, he must say that they were behind the Whigs in their advocacy of the freedom of\n\nthe soil. Mr. Lincoln proceeded to rally the Buffalo Convention for forbearing to say anything—after\n\nall the previous declarations of those members who were formerly Whigs—on the subject\n\nof theMexican war, because the Van Burens had been known to have supported it. He declared that of\n\nall the parties asking the confidence of the country, this new one hadlessof principle than any other. He wondered whether it was still the opinion of these Free Soil gentlemen, as declared\n\nin the “whereas” at Buffalo, that the whig and democratic parties were both entirely\n\ndissolved and absorbed into their own body. Had theVermontelectiongiven them any light? They had calculated on making as great an impression in that\n\nState as in any part of the Union, and there their attempts had been wholly ineffectual.\n\nTheir failure there was a greater success than they would find in any other part of\n\nthe Union.7 Mr. Lincoln went on to say that he honestly believed that all those who wished to\n\nkeep up the character of the Union; who did not believe in enlarging our field, but\n\nin keeping our fences where they are and cultivating our present possession, making\n\nit a garden, improving the morals and education of the people; devoting the administration\n\nto this purpose; all real Whigs, friends of good honest government;—the race was ours.\n\nHe had opportunities of hearing from almost every part of the Union from reliable\n\nsources, and had not heard of a country in which we had not received accessions from\n\nother parties. If the true Whigs come forward and join these new friends, they need\n\nnot have a doubt. We had a candidate whose personal character and principles he had\n\nalready described, whom he could not eulogize if he would. Gen. Taylor had been constantly,\n\nperseveringly, quietly standing up,doing his duty, and asking no praise or reward for it. He was and must be just the man to whom the\n\ninterests, principles and prosperity of the country might be safely intrusted. He\n\nhad never failed in anything he had undertaken, although many of his duties had been\n\nconsidered almost impossible. Mr. Lincoln then went into a terse though rapid review of the origin of the Mexican\n\nwar and the connection of the administration and of General Taylor with it, from which\n\nhe deduced a strong appeal to the Whigs present to do their duty in the support of\n\nGeneral Taylor, and closed with the warmest aspirations for and confidence in a deserved\n\nsuccess At the close of this truly masterly and convincing speech, the audience gave three\n\nenthusiastic cheers for Illinois, and three more for the eloquent Whig member from\n\nthatState.",

Taylor occupied a high and unexceptionable whig ground,\n               and took for his first instance and proof of this his statement in the Allison letter—with\n               regard to the Bank, Tariff, Rivers and Harbors, &c.[etc]—that the will of the people should produce its own results, without Executive influence.3The principle that the people should do what—under the constitution—they please,\n               is a whig principle.  All that Gen. Taylor does is not only to consent, but to appeal\n               to the people to judge and act for themselves.  And this was no new doctrine for Whigs.\n               It was the “platform” on which they had fought all their battles, the resistance of\n               Executive influence, and the principle of enabling the people to frame the government\n               according to their will.  Gen. Taylor consents to be the candidate, and to assist\n               the people to do what they think to be their duty, and think to be best in their natural\n               affairs, but becausehe don’t want to tell what we ought to do, he is accused of having no principles  The Whigs here maintained for years that neither the influence, the duress, or the\n               prohibition of the Executive should control the legitimately expressed will of the\n               people; and now that on that very ground, Gen. Taylor says that he should use the\n               power given him by the people to do, to the best of his judgment, the will of the\n               people, he is accused of want of principle, and of inconsistency in position.4"
