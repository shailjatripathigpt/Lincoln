        "text": "3This payment is related to legal work Lincoln performed on behalf of Lucian G. Fisher\n                  related to the caseDillingham v. Fisher. At the request ofDavid Davisin February 1856, Lincoln examined Fisher’s case and, in March 1856, drafted a detailed\n                  legal opinion of its strengths. Lincoln believed Fisher would triumph if the case ever came to\n                  trial. Both Davis and Lincoln were apparently unaware at the time that in January\n                  1856,Paul Dillinghamhad sued Fisher in an action of ejectment inWisconsin’s Rocky County Circuit Court. Dillingham claimed that in December 1855, he purchased\n                  two lots of land worth $6,000 in Beloit, Wisconsin—land which he claimed Fisher was\n                  occupying illegally. Fisher pled not guilty to this charge, asserting that he had\n                  purchased the land legally and possessed valid title to the land. The case went to\n                  trial on February 26, 1856. The jury ruled that Fisher was not guilty, and JudgeJames R. Doolittleordered that Dillingham pay Fisher for $10.10 for costs associated with the case.In June 1856, Dillingham appealed the decision to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. In\n                  December 1856, the court upheld the Rocky County Circuit Court’s ruling. Dillingham\n                  then appealed to theU.S. Supreme Court. In January 1858, however, Dillingham and Fisher reached an agreement, and, in January\n                  1859, the court dismissed the case.Lincoln did not serve as an attorney in either the initial case or the two subsequent\n                  appeal cases. He received at least $120 in total for services rendered.Dillingham v. Fisher, Martha L.
