        "text": "2Martin L. Bishop’s reply, if he penned one, has not been located.Bishop was involved in at least three lawsuits against the Illinois Central Railroad,\n                  all of which took place in theMcLean County Circuit Court. The earliest of the three known cases,Bishop v. Illinois Central RR, was dismissed by the railroad company, at their expense, in September 1853. Soon\n                  afterward, on October 7, 1853, the Illinois Central Railroad officially hired Lincoln\n                  to represent it in the caseIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parke, and other cases. At the request ofMason Brayman, the railroad’s general solicitor, Lincoln declined new cases against the railroad\n                  that came his way between October 1853 and 1855, passing at least some on to Stuart\n                  (and thereby losing opportunities to earn additional legal fees as a direct result\n                  of his employment for the railroad). However, Lincoln continued representing clients\n                  against the railroad during this period if they had engaged his services prior to\n                  the date he officially began working for the railroad, as was apparently the case\n                  with Bishop and at least one other client.As this letter indicates, after dismissing the firstBishop v. Illinois Central RRcase in September 1853, the Illinois Central Railroad continued negotiating with\n                  Bishop regarding his property. In April 1854, Bishop sued the railroad again, in a\n                  case also titledBishop v. Illinois Central RR.William H. Holmes, Stuart, and Lincoln represented Bishop;Asahel Gridleyrepresented the railroad. Bishop asked for $5,000 in damages to twenty acres of his\n                  land. On April 20, 1854, the jury found for Bishop and awarded $583.  The McLean County\n                  Circuit Court granted a new trial.  In the second trial, the court again ruled for\n                  Bishop, and awarded $470 in April 1856.In April 1855, Bishop again sued the Illinois Central Railroad, this time in an action\n                  of assumpsit, or, in other words, for breach of contract. In   an action of assumpsit\n                  case, a plaintiff sued for the collection of damages, which were awarded in an amount\n                  determined by either the court or jury. This case was also titledBishop v. Illinois Central RR. Lincoln, Stuart, andBenjamin S. Edwardsrepresented Bishop; Gridley represented the railroad again. The McLean County Circuit\n                  Court dismissed the suit in September 1856, with the railroad paying the costs.Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, states that Lincoln represented the Illinois Central Railroad inBishop v. Illinois Central RR, and that the railroad won. This is incorrect. Lincoln represented Bishop in both\n                  cases titledBishop v. Illinois Central RR, and neither was decided in the railroad’s favor.Judgment and Execution Docket, Document ID: 53054; Order, Document ID: 53053; Judgment\n                     Docket, Document ID: 53058,Bishop v.
