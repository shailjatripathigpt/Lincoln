However, Haines and Lincoln\n                  exchanged at least seven more letters related to this legal case. Haines is discussing\n                  the caseHaines v. Rugg. In the fall of 1856, Haines suedGeorge H. Ruggin the U.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois for infringing upon his\n                  patent on a reaper (a kind of harvesting machine). Lincoln represented Haines andT. Lyle Dickeyrepresented Rugg. The case went to trial in March 1858 and lasted just four days.\n                  JudgeThomas Drummondruled for the plaintiff and awarded Haines $2,300 in damages. Rugg appealed this\n                  decision to theU.S. Supreme Courtin the case,Rugg v. Haines. Lincoln represented Haines until he was elected president in the1860 Federal Election.Rugg v. Hainescommenced December 9, 1862. On December 15, 1862, JusticeRoger B. Taneyupheld the lower court’s decision and awarded Haines $2,300 in damages as well as\n                  costs expended in the suit.In 1858, Haines also suedWait Talcott, along with the other surviving representatives ofManny and Company, in a separate case for infringement upon his reaper patent.
