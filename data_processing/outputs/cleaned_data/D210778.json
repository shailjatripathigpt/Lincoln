        "text": "2In the1858 Federal Election,DemocratStephen A. Douglas was running for reelection to theU.S. Senate. Lincoln was theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace him.For a time, Lincoln followed Douglas on the campaign trail, delivering speeches either\n                  later in the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. This posed challenges,\n                  however, as many spectators were unwilling to devote long hours or days to campaign\n                  events.  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Politicians and party managers often scheduled political meetings to coincide with\n                  circuses, fairs, and other local festivities to ensure a large audience. Circus tents\n                  also provided a public place for large crowds to congregate. In the 1858 senatorial\n                  campaign, Lincoln and Douglas spoke in several localities in conjunction with circus\n                  performances or fairs.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 483-85; Richard E.\n                     Hart,Circuses in Lincoln’s Springfield (1833-1860)(Springfield: Richard E.

Douglas eventually\n                  agreed, and these became theLincoln-Douglas Debates.Douglas delivered a campaign address in Hillsboro, Illinois on August 2. Lincoln traveled\n                  to Hillsboro on September 8, stayed at Eccles’ home, and delivered a campaign speech\n                  on September 9.Gillespie did not officially join the race for the state’s Twenty-First Senate District\n                  seat until September, when a union convention held in Madison County and composed\n                  of Republicans as well as formerWhigandAmerican Partymembers nominated him for the seat.In the end, in the local elections of 1858, voters in the Twenty-First Illinois Senate\n                  District elected DemocratSamuel A. Buckmasterover Gillespie. Voters in the Twentieth Illinois House District elected Davis. Republicans\n                  won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control\n                  of the Illinois General Assembly. Lincoln ultimately received forty-six votes in the\n                  General Assembly. Buckmaster and Davis both cast their ballots for Douglas, who received\n                  a total of fifty-one votes and retained his seat in the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Abraham Lincoln to Joseph T.
