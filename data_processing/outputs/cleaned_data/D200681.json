Turley, which was tried in theLogan County Circuit Courtbetween April 1851 and September 1853. In July 1836, George W. Turley gaveThomas P. Taylora promissory note for $100, but failed to pay.  After Taylor died in August 1842,\n                  Hays became the administrator of his estate. He retained Lincoln as his attorney,\n                  and sued Turley to collect the debt.In October 1852, LincolnwroteHays that he had agreed to give Turley a few months to find evidence supporting his\n                  claim that Taylor had promised to destroy the note and forgive the debt.  Lincoln\n                  justified the action by writing that he felt sorry for Turley, “poorand acrippleas he is.” In September 1853, Turley produced two  witnesses to support his claim\n                  that he had once offered Taylor the money, but Taylor refused it. In the end, on September\n                  7, 1853, the court ruled that Turley pay the estate $116.90, awarding only $16.90\n                  in interest since that was the interest accrued “between the offer to pay and the\n                  bringing of the suit.” Lincoln kept this $16.90 as a fee for his legal services.Receipt, Document ID: 83371,Hays v.
