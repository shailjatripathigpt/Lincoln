        "text": "2Jesse K. Dubois is undoubtedly requesting Abraham Lincoln speak on the subject of\n                  the upcoming state and federal elections. Previously, Dubois hadwrittento Lincoln that he could not, “rest contented without your promise me to come to\n                  this region.” Dubois’ invitation was one of several Lincoln received during the summer\n                  and fall of 1856 asRepublicansbattled for political power inIllinoisand the nation. Between July and November 1856, Lincoln crisscrossed the state canvassing\n                  on behalf of Republican Party candidates for political office. He delivered over fifty\n                  speeches in support of the Republican cause. See the1856 Federal Election.The fall session of the Lawrence County Circuit Court was scheduled to begin September\n                  8, 1856. In hisresponse, Lincoln promised to “strain every nerve” to visit Lawrenceville and Dubois. Lincoln\n                  spoke at Lawrenceville on September 19.In 1856, Republicans nominatedJohn C. Fremontas their first presidential candidate, whileDemocratsnominatedJames Buchanan. TheAmerican Party, in its final participation in a presidential election, nominatedMillard Fillmore. Republicans, concerned that two opposition tickets would favor the Democrats,exploredcampaign strategies to ensure their candidate, Fremont, would be elected. In alettertoJames Berdanin July 1856, Lincoln suggested a possible fusion ticket, bringing together supporters\n                  of the American and Republican parties. In the end, Lincolnimplementeda mail campaign, sending form letters to Fillmore supporters informing them that\n                  every vote for their candidate in Illinois lessened his chance of becoming president.Lincoln and his fellow Republicans failed to convince Fillmore’s supporters to unite,\n                  allowing Democrats to label their opponents as both nativists and worshippers of African\n                  Americans. Lincoln’s prediction proved prophetic. Buchanan captured Illinois with\n                  44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont and 15.7 for Fillmore and became\n                  the fifteenth president of the United States. Indeed, if the votes received by Fremont\n                  and Fillmore in Illinois had been combined, Buchanan’s vote would not have been sufficient\n                  to carry the state.“An Act to Change the Limits and Fix the Time for Holding Courts in the Fourth Judicial\n                     Circuit,” 12 February 1853,General Laws of Illinois(1853), 64;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 19 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-19; 1 November 1856,http://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-11-01;Thomas A.
