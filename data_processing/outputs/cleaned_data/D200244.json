    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on Resolution Commemorating the Battle of New Orleans,\n\n8 January 1841 Mr.Shepleyasked leave to offer the following Resolution, Resolved, That thisHouseout of respect for the conservators of “Beauty and Booty” on the plains ofNew Orleans, achieved by their unprecedented skill and bravery and under the able directions\n\nof the Illustrious and immortalAndrew Jackson, do now adjourn.1 The question being on granting leave to introduce the above Resolution. The yeas\n\nand nays were called for, and leave was granted, Yeas 63, Nays 19.2 The questing being on the adoption of the Resolution. Mr.Minshallproposed to amend by adding the words “sine die” after adjourn (a laugh) which being out of order was dropped. MrHardinsupported the Resolution in a speech of great interest in which he maintained that\n\nthevictory of New Orleanswas a national triumph deserving of commemoration without any reference to mere politics:\n\nhe held that the military glory and reputation of Gen. Jackson belonged to his country\n\nand ought to be cherished by every American: Mr. H. descanted in a strain of patriotic\n\neloquence on the ingratitude of Republics to their great and illustrious men, and\n\ncontended that the name of theHero of New Orleansought to be enrolled among theWashingtons,John Jays,Franklins,Henrys,HamiltonandJeffersonsof this country. Mr.H. concluded with hoping that the Resolution would be passed unanimously without a\n\ndissentient voice. MrGridleywas willing to vote for the Preamble, but not for the adjournment: he thought the\n\nbusiness of the country ought to be attended to, he objected to the loss of time and\n\nthe expense which this adjournment would occasion, his constituents would not forgive\n\nhim if he should go for an adjournment under such circumstances. MrHendersonwas opposed to the Resolution: he considered the battle of N. Orleans was a subject\n\nof regret and mourning, as having been fought when our ministers had concluded a peace.3He was against adjourning as it would occasion an unnecessary loss of time and expense\n\nto theState. MrBissellafter passing a high compliment upon Mr. Hardin for his just and liberal views, proceeded\n\nto reply to the remarks ofMessrs. Henderson and Gridley. They, said Mr. B. object to the passage of this resolution\n\non account of the delay of business which an adjournment will occasion. This (said\n\nMr. B.) is a strange objection to come from such a quarter. These gentlemen had not\n\non former occasions shown themselves so very reluctant to retard the progress of Legislative\n\nbusiness. He reminded the House that but a few weeks ago when a great and important\n\nquestion was before the house, thegentlemanfromPutnam& thegentlemanfromMcLeanas well as most of those who usually act with them, absented themselves with the\n\navowed object of leaving the House without a quorum, that its business might be not\n\nonly obstructed but arrested altogether. They left the House almost an entire half\n\nday without a quorum. They went farther than this. They threatened the sergeant-at-arms\n\nwith personal violence for attempting to execute the orders of the House; & after\n\nthey had been relnctantly brought in by that officer, they, or some of them, burst through the windows and\n\nmade their escape. All this was done it is openly acknowledged for the purpose of\n\npreventing the action of the House upon the business before it.4These same gentlemen now object to half a day’s adjournment, on an extraordinary\n\noccasion, from an extreme unwillingness to delay for a single hour the business of\n\nthe people. But (said Mr. B.) is this theirrealobjection? He apprehended not. He believed that when the gentleman from Putnam (Mr.\n\nHenderson) said that the victory of New Orleans was a source of sorrow and regret\n\nto him (MrHendersonexplained those were not his words: He had said that after peace had been concluded\n\nthe loss of blood at that battle was a source of regret.) MrBissellcontinued: very well; the gentleman shall have it as he pleasesHe is now understood. He says that the loss of blood at the battle of New Orleans\n\nby which alone the “beauty and booty” of thatcitywere saved from the ravages of a monarch’s ruthless soldiers, is to him under the\n\ncircumstances, a matter of regret.Mr. B. hesitated not to say that he who can give utterance to such sentiments would\n\nhave no objections to celebrating thesurrender of Hullor thedefeat of Winchester:5and had the result of the battle of New Orleans proved disastrous to our arms—had\n\nthe “beauty and booty of that city fallen into the hands of British soldiers,” Mr.\n\nB. believed that the gentleman fromPutnamwould never have said of it, “it is a matter of regret.” Thegentlemanfrom McLean says that his constituents will not forgive him if he delays the public\n\nbusiness by going for this adjournment. If his constituents had forgiven him for\n\ndelaying the public business on the occasion which he (Mr. B.) had before referred\n\nto, he believed they would readily forgive him for celebrating the anniversary of\n\na great and glorious victory. MrLogancalled for the previous question but withdrew it to allow Mr. Henderson an opportunity\n\nto explain. MrHendersonsaid he had a direct way of doing things which others might not have. Mr H. then\n\nwent into an explanation of the sine die adventure:6thegentlemanfromMonroe(Mr Bissell) had said some members were reluctantly brought back—Mr. H. could tell\n\nhim that he (Mr. H) could not have been brought back when he chose to stay away.\n\nAs to that session it would be recollected he always maintained that “the wrong passenger\n\nhad been wakened up.” The gentleman said that he (Mr. H) would wish to commemorate\n\nthedefeats of Hull and Winchester, he would have that gentleman to know that he (Mr H.) had been where he (Mr. B) would not like to be, he had been in the battles of his country and had had\n\nabove a quart of bullets showered about his head in the battle field. Mr. H. would\n\nvote against the Resolution on every ground—there was not one word in it which he\n\nliked. (Mr. H. in the course of his remarks alluded to what he thought a hiss which\n\nhe supposed had been directed against him—and observed that there were sometimes people\n\nwho got into company where they ought not to be. TheSpeakersaid he had never heard any such improper demonstration.) MrKitchellhoped the Resolution would pass. He looked upon this day and the 4th of July as\n\nthe two great days which ought ever to be celebrated, and observed as a political\n\nSabbath. As to the battle of New Orleans being fought after peace was concluded,\n\nit should be remembered it was fought in defence only: it was the healing balm which covered our disgraces in the War. Mr. K. then\n\nrenewed the call for the Previous question but withdrew it for MrGridleywho explained his course of the sine die day: he had been sick on that day: after having voted he went out by the window because\n\nthe door was blocked up and he was prevented from going out, he only regretted that\n\nhe had not forced the door open. As to the question, he thought it his duty not to\n\nadjourn, and he should act as his conscience directed him in the discharge of his\n\nduty MrBissellwould be extremely unwilling to do the gentleman from McLean (Mr. Gridley) any injustice.\n\nHe had never heard before that he (Mr. G.) left the House on the occasion referred\n\nto, on account of his illness. He saw him rushing through a window while the vote\n\nwas being taken on an important question, and this circumstance, in the absence of\n\nthe explanation which now, for the first time, he (Mr. G.) had made to the House,\n\njustified the remark which he (Mr. B.) had made that the gentleman from McLean had\n\nshrank from his duty on that occasion. The gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Henderson) said Mr. B. though he boasts much of his\n\nown courage, evidently entertains a very mean opinion of the bravery of others. Mr.\n\nB. should not on this occasion question the prowess and bravery of the chivalrous\n\ngentleman from Putnam, although he (Mr. B.) could not refrain from saying that when\n\nhe heard a man boasting of his courage, he was very apt to conclude that he is not\n\nquite so courageous as he would be thought. He says he has been in places where I\n\nwould not like to be; and where a “quart” of bullets were flying around his head at\n\nthe same time.Mr. B. should by no means call the truth of this statement in question. All he should\n\nsay was, that of the “quart” of bullets which flewaoundhis head, half of them at least, in Mr B’s. opinion,had lodged therein. (A laugh.) MrWoodson’s reasons for voting against the Resolution were the same as those given by the gentleman\n\nfrom McLean (Mr Gridley): he (Mr. W) would not vote for the whole resolution, he would\n\nvote for so much as was laudatory of Gen. Jackson. In relation to the subjects which\n\nhad been discussed, the jumping out of the window, &c. The Speaker called Mr. Woodson to order, cries of “leave, leave go on &c.” The Speaker said the gentleman would not go on out of order, unless by the consent\n\nof the majority. The question was then put by the Speaker, “Shall the gentleman proceed out of order\n\nto answer the gentleman who was out of order.” A division being called for, it was decided in the affirmative, Yeas 45. So the House\n\ndecided to let Mr.Woodson go on. Mr.Englishspoke in favor of theResolution, and proceeded at some length to examine the reasons against it by his colleague. Mr.Lincolnsaid that as that jumping scrape had become so celebrated it appeared necessary that\n\nhe should say something about it. The Speaker called Mr Lincoln to order. Mr.Lincolnsaid that as to jumping, he should jump when he pleased and no one should hinder\n\nhim. He thought this Resolution ought to pass. Mr. L. proceeded to advocate it, as\n\na national subject, not on party grounds: he was proud of the victory of New Orleans,\n\nand the military fame of Gen. Jackson, though he could never find in his heart to\n\nsupport him as a politician. He had sat for 6 years in theLegislature, and this day had always been observed as a matter of course, with no view whatever\n\nto politics. Mr.Munsellmoved to amend by striking out that portion of the Resolution which proposed to adjourn. Mr.Westregretted much that this question had assumed a party shape; he would go for the\n\nResolution, as it was only for a half a day, he would support it and he hoped it would\n\npass. Mr.Gillespiespoke in favor of the Resolution: he hoped it would pass, it was to commemorate an\n\nevent which deserves the gratitude of the American people. It was never the policy\n\nof theWhig partyto detract from the reputation of Gen. Jackson in the least degree: for his military\n\nexploits he deserved the gratitude of a grateful people. He would go for the Resolution\n\nas a matter of course.He went on to express his regret that a question of party had been raised on this subject. MrMunsellwithdrew his amendment. MrGridleyexpressed his willingness to go for the Resolution without an adjournment. MrPeckoffered an amendment laudatory of Gen. Jackson as a Statesman.7 MrHardinsaid this mixing up of political questions with the Resolution did not suit him;He then moved to lay the Amendment on the table, whereupon Mr. Peck withdrew it. The question being on the adoption of the Resolution, Mr Gridley moved a division\n\nof the question. MrKitchellhoped Mr Peck would renew his amendment. Mr.MurphyofPerryspoke in disapprobation of the party tumult which had been commenced by the gentleman of the Whig party and not by those of thedemocratic party. MrHendersonspoke briefly against both divisions of the Resolution: he never liked General Jackson\n\nin any capacity or in any manner, any-how.He should go against the whole Resolution. MrThrelkeldspoke briefly in support of the Resolution. MrDollinscalled for the previous question which was ordered, and discussion ceased The amendment of Mr Peck was then lost.8 The Original resolution was then carried first in part, then altogether, and the house\n\nadjourned.9",

All this was done it is openly acknowledged for the purpose of\n               preventing the action of the House upon the business before it.4These same gentlemen now object to half a day’s adjournment, on an extraordinary\n               occasion, from an extreme unwillingness to delay for a single hour the business of\n               the people.
