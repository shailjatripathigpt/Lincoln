Treatopining that the company had been perfected to prosecute the work to completion.In April 1854, Lincoln served as plaintiff attorney in the casePeople ex rel. Moulton v. Sandford et al.in theMadison County Circuit Court.Samuel W. Moultonclaimed that Edward Sandford,John Brough, and others unlawfully held offices in the unchartered Mississippi and Atlantic Railroad\n                  Company.

Sanford argued that the Illinois General Assembly had chartered the\n                  railroad, and the case was dismissed.Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 19 April 1854, 3:4;People of the State of Illinois, on the Relation of Eldredge S.
