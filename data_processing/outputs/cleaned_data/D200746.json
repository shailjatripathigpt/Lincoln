        "text": "2In an endorsement on aletterNathaniel Coffinwrote Lincoln on June 21, 1853, Lincoln reveals thatWilliam Weer, Jr.andAlexander M. Duboiswere the parties in Carlinville, Illinois to whom he wrote. Lincoln’s letter to Weer\n                  and Dubois has not been located.This letter is related to the legal case,Gilman et al. v. Hamilton et al. In 1835, Gideon Blackburn purchased more than 16,000 acres of land throughoutIllinoisas a fund with which to build a seminary in Carlinville.  Blackburn conveyed the\n                  land to six trustees to carry out his wishes, then died in 1838.  By 1844, the Blackburn\n                  trustees had sold some of the land to pay the taxes but had not yet begun to build\n                  the seminary.  Fearing that the land was not valuable and that they could not raise\n                  enough money, in 1844Winthrop S. Gilmanand the other Blackburn trustees suedElizabeth H. Hamiltonand Blackburn's other heirs in an action to convey the land to the trustees ofIllinois Collegeand establish the \"Blackburn Theological Professorship\" at Illinois College.  The\n                  case began in the Macoupin County Circuit Court, but, in September 1844, the court\n                  granted a change of venue to theSangamon County Circuit Court.  Blackburn's heirs agreed with the trustees, and the court ordered the conveyance\n                  of the land to Illinois College in March 1845.  Illinois College subsequently sold\n                  most of the land to Coffin.  Blackburn's heirs apparently reconsidered and appealed\n                  the judgment to theIllinois Supreme Court.  In December 1850, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the case on a technicality\n                  and remanded it back to the Sangamon County Circuit Court.  Gilman and the other Blackburn\n                  trustees had not proven their case, especially against Blackburn's minor heir.The case returned to the Sangamon County Circuit Court in March 1851, and Gilman retained\n                  Lincoln, Coffin,John M. Palmer, andDavid A. Smith.  Blackburn's heirs filed a cross-bill against Gilman and the Blackburn trustees,\n                  Coffin, and the Illinois College trustees.  In November 1854, the Sangamon County\n                  Circuit Court ruled that neither Coffin nor Illinois College had any title in the\n                  lands, which remained with the Blackburn trustees.  The court ordered the Blackburn\n                  trustees to sell the land, build the buildings, establish the seminary as Gideon Blackburn\n                  had wished, and  pay Illinois College and Coffin the money that they had expended\n                  in taxes.  In December 1854, Gilman, Coffin, and Illinois College appealed the case\n                  to the Illinois Supreme Court.  That same month, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed\n                  the judgment.  JusticeWalter B. Scatesinvoked the cy-pres rule, which called for the fulfillment of Gideon Blackburn's\n                  original intentions as nearly as possible. Scates asserted that the Blackburn trustees\n                  incorrectly attempted to change Gideon Blackburn's idea of a seminary to a professorship\n                  at a different college.  As a result of the decree, Coffin applied to the Sangamon\n                  County Circuit Court for a refund of $7,677.18, but, after some reductions, the master\n                  in chancery awarded him $2,921.14 in October 1858.  In September 1859, the court set\n                  aside that award and awarded him $2,697.61 on his claim.  Lincoln received at least\n                  $100 for his legal services.Decree, Document ID: 134855,Gilman et al. v. Hamilton et al., Martha L.
