Perleysent a petition toAbraham Lincolnon July 12, 1858, with the signatures of thirtyDemocratsand fiftyRepublicans, inviting him to visit Henry, Illinois. Lincolnagreedon August 3. The invitation stemmed from Lincoln’s recent nomination at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Lincoln boarded a train at 3 a.m. on August 23 and arrived in Henry, Illinois, to\n                  address the town for several hours on his promised date.

        "text": "2In the fifthLincoln-Douglas Debateon October 7 inGalesburg, Illinois, Douglas charged that Lincoln was an abolitionist, but only when politically convenient.\n                  He argued, “Abolitionists up north are expected and required to vote for Lincoln because\n                  he goes for the equality of the races, holding that by the Declaration of Independence\n                  the white man and the negro were created equal and endowed by the Divine law with\n                  that equality, and down south he tells the old Whigs, theKentuckians,Virginians, andTennesseans, that there is a physical difference in the races, making one superior and the other\n                  inferior, and that he is in favor of maintaining the superiority of the white race\n                  over the negro.”In aspeechinGreenville, Illinoison September 13, Lincoln refuted the same charges from Douglas of being an abolitionist\n                  and amalgamationist, asserting that while he believed slavery to be a moral, social,\n                  and political evil, he also would not interfere with slavery in the states where it\n                  already existed.An amalgamationist was believed to support the merging—or amalgamation—of the black\n                  and white races through, in this context, interracial marriage or sexual activity.Fifth Debate with Stephen A.

        "text": "3Douglas, unlike Lincoln and the Republicans, supported the decision in the Dred Scott\n                  case, which effectively barred any current or future emancipated slave from the right\n                  of United States citizenship and solidified the right of American citizens to transport\n                  their property wherever they wished—including taking an enslaved individual into a\n                  free state—without feared loss of that property. Douglas’s support for the Scott decision\n                  essentially invalidated his well established advocacy of the concept of popular sovereignty,\n                  which he argued allowed territorial and state governments to either allow or prohibit\n                  slavery as they saw fit.  Lincoln’s main concern with popular sovereignty had been\n                  its power to “allow the people of a Territory to have Slavery if they want to, but\n                  does not allow themnotto have it if they donotwant it.”  The Scott decision proved Lincoln’s assertion, to which he remarked, “as\n                  I understand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have\n                  no way of keeping that one man from holding them.”Carl Brent Swisher, \"Dred Scott Case,\"Dictionary of American History, rev. ed.
