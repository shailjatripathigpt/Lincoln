        "text": "3In the1856 Federal Election, Republicans nominated John C. Fremont as their first presidential candidate, while\n                  Democrats nominatedJames Buchanan. TheAmerican Party, in its final participation in a presidential election, nominatedMillard Fillmore. Between July and November 1856, Lincoln crisscrossed Illinois canvassing on behalf\n                  of Republican Party candidates for political office. He delivered over fifty speeches\n                  in support of the Republican cause.Another description of the event reads as follows: “Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A.\n                  Douglas both spoke in Olney at political rallies on Saturday, September 20, 1856.\n                  Douglas spoke in a grove near town and Lincoln in the courthouse. Douglas leftSpringfieldFriday and atVandaliamet Lincoln, Dick Taylor and his fellow Democrat, William A. Richardson. They took\n                  a train for Olney in the evening. At Olney Lincoln met the other two Republican orators,\n                  Senator Lyman Trumbull and Ebenezer Peck of Chicago. The Republicans challenged the\n                  Democrats to a joint discussion, but met with refusal.”“At 8 a.m. people began assembling in town, delegations coming from all quarters with\n                  flags, banners and music, and according to the only two newspaper accounts of the\n                  meeting, which happen to be both Democratic, all the banners bore the names of ‘Buchanan\n                  andBreckinridge.’ Not a single Republican banner for ‘Fremont andDayton’ was to be seen. This account was typical of the political reporting of the day,\n                  not only in theMissouri Republicanand theChicago Times, which describe the meeting, but in all papers.”Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:425-33;Cong. Record, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., Appendix, 5369-70 (1959)."

Richland County gave Buchanan 62.1 percent of the vote, and the surrounding counties,\n                  with the exception of Edwards and Wabash, which went for Fillmore, gave Buchanan strong\n                  majorities.Arthur Charles Cole,The Era of the Civil War 1848-1870, vol. 3 ofThe Centennial History of Illinois(Springfield: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1919), 151; Howard W.
