        "text": "2Sharpe references the state elections inIllinois, which occurred on November 2, 1858.   Abraham Lincoln, the candidate of theRepublican Party, was challengingStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for seat in theU.S. Senate.   Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat.  Lincoln and Douglas alsodebatedat seven Illinois towns  during the campaign.In the state’s local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly and Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.\n                  See1858 Federal Election;1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 November 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458-60, 492-540, 556-47;\n                     Allen C.
