        "text": "2Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee to supplant James Shields as U.S. Senator.Although Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, on November 25, 1854\n                  he officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate. In November and\n                  December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies seeking support for\n                  his candidacy and information about his prospects.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

Bissell for the ultimate benefit of James Shields. On January 14, 1855,\n                  Lincolnrepliedto Yates, stating that he had been aware of such a “Bissell movement” for some time,\n                  but did not believe any “sincere” anti-Nebraskans would vote for Bissell. The true\n                  danger, Lincoln stated, was that those in favor of the Kansas-Nebraska Act would throw\n                  their support behind Bissell “en masse” if they could not find a better candidate,\n                  prompting a few insincere anti-Nebraska men to join the Bissell movement as well."
