Abraham Lincoln had backed Swett, fearful that Lovejoy’s connection withabolitionismwould hurt the chances of a Republican winning the seat.   Lincoln responded to Swett’s\n                  defeat in aletterto Henry C. Whitney: “It turned me blind when I first heard Swett was beaten, and\n                  Lovejoy nominated; but after much anxious reflection, I really believe it is best\n                  to let it stand.”   Lincoln expressed similar sentiments in aletterto David Davis.Mitchell Snay, “Abraham Lincoln, Owen Lovejoy, and the Emergence of the Republican\n                     Party in Illinois,”Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association22 (Winter 2001), 93."

In October 1854, Lovejoy was among the anti-Nebraska\n                  men who called for a state Republican convention to be held in Springfield on October\n                  4 and 5 to coincide with the state fair.  The delegates appointed a state central\n                  committee and chose Lincoln, who did not attend the meeting, as representative fromSangamon County.  Lovejoy vouched for Lincoln’s support of the anti-slavery platform, but Lincoln,\n                  still clinging to hisWhig Partyallegiance and fearful of too close an association with abolitionism, refused to\n                  allow his name to be associated with the committee.Mitchell Snay, “Abraham Lincoln, Owen Lovejoy, and the Emergence of the Republican\n                     Party in Illinois,”Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association22 (Winter 2001), 82-99; Arthur Charles Cole,The Era of the Civil War 1848-1870, vol. 3 ofThe Centennial History of Illinois(Springfield, IL: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1919), 128-29;Ichabod Codding to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Ichabod Codding."
