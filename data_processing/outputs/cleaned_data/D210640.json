Paine had previouslywrittenLincoln on December 9, 1854, expressing his support for Lincoln’s bid for the U.S.\n                  Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.

Logan, who representedSangamon Countyin the Illinois House of Representatives during the Nineteenth General Assembly,\n                  acted as Lincoln’s floor manager in the election of U.S. Senator in a  joint session\n                  of the General Assembly on February 8, 1855. Lincoln was among the leading contenders,\n                  but despite the efforts of Logan and his other allies, he failed to garner a majority\n                  of votes. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped\n                  out of contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullto ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Trumbull was elected\n                  Illinois’ new U.S. senator on the tenth round.
