        "text": "4Responding to Rives in aletterdated May 7, 1849, Abraham Lincoln felt that Rives overrated Lincoln’s capacity to\n                  be of service.   “Not one man recommended by me has yet been appointed to any thing,\n                  little or big,” Lincoln wrote, “except a few who had no opposition.”  Moreover, Lincoln\n                  had already endorsed, so far without success, Anson G. Henry for an appointment in\n                  the Minnesota Territory, and he did not feel he could promote Rives’ interests until\n                  Henry had or had not received a position.  Rives’ name does not appear in the official\n                  registers of the officers and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so\n                  apparently he did not receive an appointment.Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853)."
