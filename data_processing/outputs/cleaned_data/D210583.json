Lincoln wrote similar letters to other political allies  in November and December\n                  1854.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first).  As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S.\n                  Senate seats.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

        "text": "5Although Hoyt refers to Benjamin Hackney as a Whig, the Kane CountyRepublican Partyendorsed both him and Augustus Adams during the election of 1854. They both ran as\n                  fusionist candidates. Fusion tickets became common during the election, as disaffected\n                  Whigs and Democrats banded together with Free Soilers,Nativists, and temperance advocates. Many Whigs also fused with Democrats who shared their\n                  distaste for the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the extension of slavery. See the1854 Federal Election. In Kane County, Whig and Republican candidates fused with Democratic candidates\n                  over both opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act  and the prohibition of alcohol.The citizens of Kane andDeKalbcounties elected Hackney to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1854, along\n                  withWilliam Patten, the “other member” Hoyt references. Hackney won 1,093 votes, Patten won 1,143 votes,\n                  and their closest opponent, Democrat A. J. Waldron, won 956 votes. Kane and DeKalb\n                  counties also elected Adams to theIllinois Senate. He triumphed over his Democratic and Whig opponents with 1,268 votes to their 939\n                  and 434 votes, respectively.No correspondence between Lincoln and Hackney has been located. In a November 30letterto Lincoln,Alexander C. Gibsonstated that, at the request of Hoyt, he called upon Hackney and “found him well disposed\n                  towards your election.” Gibson also reported that Hackney claimed Adams had agreed\n                  to act with him on supporting Lincoln for U.S. Senator, but that Adams would not offer\n                  a “positive pledge on the question, at present.”In aletterdated December 17, 1854, Adams indicates that Lincoln wrote him on December 5. In\n                  his December 17reply, Adams explained the criteria that he desired in a U.S. senator, ultimately stating\n                  that although “my preferences are in your favor. . . I do not wish to be considered\n                  as fully committed.” At least two of Lincoln’s other political allies also wrote him\n                  about Adams before Lincoln received Adams’ letter.In late-December 1854, HoytwroteLincoln with additional information concerning Patten’s stance on the race for the\n                  U.S. Senate.Aurora Guardian(IL), 28 September 1854, 2:3; 2 November 1854, 2:1, 2:2, 2:4; 16 November 1854, 2:4;\n                     Allen C.
