However, in May 1849, OnstottwroteLincoln asking for his help removingJonathan Dearbornfrom the position of postmaster ofHavana, Illinoisand securing the position for “your humble Servant” instead. Lincolnrepliedto that letter, confirming that he would support Onstott. Although PresidentZachary Taylorappointed Philo Noble postmaster of Havana in November 1849, in November 1850 PresidentMillard Fillmoreremoved Noble and replaced him with Onstott. Onstott’s October 16, 1850 letter to\n                  Lincoln, therefore, almost certainly contained a request for a letter of recommendation\n                  from Lincoln in support of Onstott’s appointment as postmaster.Lincoln’s letter to theU.S. Post Office Departmentrecommending Onstott for postmaster of Havana has not been located.Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832-1971, NARA Microfilm Publication, M841, 145 rolls, Records of the Post Office Department,\n                     RG 28, 1845-1855, 18:132, National Archives Building, Washington, DC;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on  the Thirtieth September, 1847(Washington, DC: J. & G.
