        "text": "2On January 16, 1837, the General Assembly elected Benjamin Enloe as warden of the\n                  Illinois State Penitentiary atAlton. Enloe began his duties on March 6, two days previous, the General Assembly passed\n                  anactincreasing the warden’s salary from $600 to $800 annually. In July 1837, governor\n                  Joseph Duncanreportedto the Illinois House of Representatives that in his opinion, the increase in Enloe’s\n                  salary was unconstitutional because Enloe was a sitting member of the General Assembly\n                  when the increase was approved. Eight days later, the General Assembly passed anactabolishing the position of warden, transferring the warden’s  authority and responsibilities\n                  in the Inspectors of the Penitentiary. Enloe only held the position of warden from\n                  March 6 to July 21, 1837, yet he claimed the state owed him the balance of the salary\n                  for the two-year term to which he was elected. In December 1838, Enloe brought suit\n                  in theIllinois Supreme Courtin an attempt to compel the Auditor to pay him the remainder of his salary. The Court\n                  disagreed and refused to compel the Auditor to pay any further money to Enloe. In\n                  January 1839, the General Assembly passed anactdirecting the Auditor to pay $200 to  Enloe as the remainder of his salary.Illinois HouseJournal. 1836. 10th G.
