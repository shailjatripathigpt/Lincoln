We would press you, therefore, most earnestly, to act promptly on this subject, and\n\nif you are unable to attend to this important business as it should be attended to,\n\nwe urge you to recommend to us, at once, some fit and upright citizen of your State\n\nwho will do it.*4 The main purposes of our organization and for which we urge the immediate raising\n\nof means, are: First. The retaining of all actual settlers now in Kansas. Second. To induce all absentees forthwith to return to the Territory, paying, if necessary,\n\nfor this end, their passage, furnishing them with clothing, &c. Third. To induce fresh emigrants to go into the Territory as rapidly as possible. The members of the committee atChicago, with such others as may meet with them, will hold a continual session and act until\n\na general meeting of the committee can be had. The necessity of a general meeting for the more permanent organization of the committee\n\nmust be apparent to every member. We need only specify one or two objects, which\n\nit is essential to accomplish, to insure success to the Free State cause. First. A thorough concert of action among the Free States— such a concert as will secure\n\npromptness and efficiency in whatever they may do. Second. The obtaining of a financial and general agent, whose business qualifications and\n\nintegrity shall command entire confidence.5 For these and other purposes, we recommend a meeting of the National Committee to\n\nbe held at Chicago, on the 30th day of July, A.D. 1856.6 In reference to the appointment of a financial and general agent, we trust that every\n\nmember of the National Committee will do what he can to present to the committee the\n\nname of a suitable person, who, if elected, will serve. The necessity of an organization of the States, and of a full meeting of the National\n\nCommittee, at the time and place specified, is too plain to be urged. Kansas can\n\nbe saved to freedom only by a prompt and vigorous action on the part of the Free States.\n\nHer citizens oppressed and harassed by the border men ofMissouri, and the ruffians of the South, and without the protection of the general government,\n\nare well nigh discouraged.7They need food and clothes, and must have money to sustain life, and men to uphold\n\nthem in their heroic struggle. Let us see that they are promptly and fully sustained. *By reference to the second resolution passed at theBuffaloConvention, you will observe thatState,CountyandTownAssociationsare to be formed for the purpose of obtaining monthly contributions.9We would urge upon you that this plan be put into immediate operation. For this purpose\n\nwe would suggest that a Committee be formed, in some principal town in your State,\n\nwhich shall act as thecentralCommittee, and attend to the organization of the County and Town Associations. As\n\nsoon as the central committee is organized, it should publish a circular to the State,\n\ndirecting such associations to be formed and reported to it, and should also send\n\none to some proper person in each county and town, so as immediately to enlist all\n\nthe effort possible. It would be well also, to employ some fit person to canvass your\n\nwhole State for the same purpose. Our work must be promptly and thoroughly done.",
