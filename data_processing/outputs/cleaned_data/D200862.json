        "text": "2The reaper suit was that ofMcCormick v. Talcott et al., which was instituted byCyrus H. McCormickagainst the  Rockford firm of Manny & Company in theU.S. Circuit Courtin November 1854. McCormick accused Manny & Co. of patent infringement, claiming\n                  that the mechanical reaper ofJohn H. Manny’s design and manufacture copied several elements of McCormick’s own reaper. Following\n                  the recommendation ofElihu B. Washburne, Washington DC attorney and patent agent Peter H. Watson visited Lincoln in Springfield\n                  in June 1855 and hired him for the defense with a $400 retainer. In addition to Watson,\n                  who had helped Manny obtain his patents, Manny & Co. was represented by attorneysGeorge HardingandEdwin M. Stanton. Lincoln was apparently an attractive addition to the legal team in part because\n                  the trial was scheduled to be held in Chicago, and none of the other defense attorneys\n                  lived inIllinois. The trial was instead moved to Cincinnati, where it commenced on September 20, 1855,\n                  and while the other members of the defense team allowed Lincoln to attend, they blocked\n                  his participation in the case. McCormick’s attorneys in the case includedIsaac N. ArnoldandEdward N. Dickerson. The verdict in the case was announced on January 16, 1856 in favor of Manny & Co.,\n                  after which McCormick appealed the decision to theU.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court’s ruling.Elihu B.

Talcott et al. Lincoln had been able to obtain copies of the bill of complaint and answer while\n                  in Chicago attending theU.S. Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois, but he urged Watson to send him any additional evidence obtained, as he would have\n                  time to work on the case in July and August."
