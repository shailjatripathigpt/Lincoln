        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote this document. The U.S. Supreme Court heard a re-argument ofScott v. Sandford—the so-called Dred Scott case—during its December 1856 term. Lincoln delivered public\n                  speeches in June 1857 and August 1858 in which he referenced the case and utilized\n                  some of the same reasoning featured in this document. Therefore,  although the precise\n                  date that Lincoln wrote this fragment  is unclear, the editors date it sometime between\n                  December 1856 and August 1858.Scott v.

        "text": "2In mid-1856, in relation to the contentious topic of theKansas Territory’s admission to the union as a state, members of theU.S. Senatedebated whether theKansas Territorial Legislaturehad the right “at any time to exclude slavery or allow it,” or whether that right\n                  was reserved for states. SenatorStephen A. Douglasargued that the issue was something for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide. Lincoln\n                  is likely alluding to this debate, which was closely connected to larger  concerns\n                  that the U.S. Supreme Court might rule, inScott v. Sandford, that the U.S. Constitution affirmed the right of slaveholders to bring enslaved\n                  persons into any and all federal territories.Cong.

Per article six of the U.S.\n                  Constitution, the members of each of the other two branches of government (legislative\n                  and executive) were bound to support the Constitution. However, the nation’s major\n                  political parties had long disagreed whether all segments of government were constitutionally-bound\n                  to enforce U.S. Supreme Court rulings. TheWhig Party, for instance, was inflamed when PresidentAndrew Jacksonrefused to enforce the Supreme Court’s ruling on the question ofSecond Bank of the United States. Lincoln was a strong supporter of a national bank and argued repeatedly that national\n                  banks were wholly constitutional.U.S. Const. art. 3, § 1; art. 6; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), 52; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:96, 150-51."

Sandford.Lincoln was deeply concerned that a future Supreme Court decision might declare it\n                  unconstitutional for a state to forbid slavery within its borders and thereby make\n                  slavery universal throughout the nation. He offered his full view of the court’s decision\n                  in the Dred Scott case during a June 1857 speech that he delivered inSpringfield, Illinois. He and Douglas also debated the case and the implications of the court’s decision\n                  during theLincoln-Douglas Debates.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln, 207-8."
