Morton was running for governor ofIndianaas the candidate of the People’s Party, ananti-Nebraskafusion organization that was the precursor to theRepublican Partyin that state. After some communication and scheduling difficulties,  Morton and\n                  hisDemocraticrival,Ashbel P. Willard, had agreed to a series of debates, including a joint appearance at Terre Haute on\n                  September 3, 1856.  This proposed Terre Haute meeting was one of several such appearances\n                  from which they later mutually withdrew. Morton appeared by himself in Terre Haute\n                  on September 9, with a plan to speak at a mass meeting inVigo Countysoon thereafter. Morton ultimately lost the election to Willard by about six thousand\n                  votes.While Lincoln delivered aspeechinKalamazoo, Michiganin August 1856, he did not visit Indiana or otherwise leave the state ofIllinoisin September 1856, although from July onwards, he gave over fifty speeches across\n                  Illinois in support of thepresidential campaignofJohn C. Fremontand to rally the disparate elements of the emerging Republican Party. See the1856 Federal Election.Ed Runden, “Oliver P. Morton,”The Governors of Indiana, ed. by Linda C. Gugin and James E.
