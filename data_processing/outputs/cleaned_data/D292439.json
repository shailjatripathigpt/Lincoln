        "text": "2On May 29, 1856, opponents of theKansas-Nebraska Actmet inBloomingtonin what effectively became the founding convention of  theRepublican PartyinIllinois. Delegates includedabolitionists, conservative anti-Nebraska Whigs, anti-Nebraska Democrats,Know Nothings,  and anti-nativist immigrants.  Recognizing the fragility of nascent Republican\n                  coalition, convention managers composed a platform designed to appeal to the broadest\n                  range of opinion.  The platform finally approved by delegates eschewed calls for the\n                  abolition of slavery; instead, it asserted that repeal of the Missouri Compromise\n                  was “unjust and injurious,” opposed the expansion of slavery to territories already\n                  free, and affirmed that the U.S. Congress held the power and authority to exclude\n                  slavery from the nation’s territories. Delegates affirmed their absolute loyalty to\n                  preserving the Union in the face of disunionism, and, to placate both immigrants and\n                  Know-Nothings, pledged not to discriminate against anyone on account of their religious\n                  affiliation or place of birth.  The slate of state officers nominated also reflected\n                  the disparate elements of the nascent party: anti-Nebraska Democrat William H. Bissell\n                  for governor, German Francis A. Hoffman for lieutenant governor, Ozias M. Hatch for\n                  secretary of state, Jesse K. Dubois for auditor of public accounts, James Miller for\n                  treasurer, and William H. Powell for superintendent of public instruction. Some of\n                  the latter were Know-Nothings and former Whigs.Lincoln attended the convention and delivered a speech in which, according to extant\n                  newspaper accounts, he voiced his commitment to the Union and opposition to slavery.After Hoffman’s nomination for lieutenant governor, party leaders discovered that\n                  he was ineligible to run for state office under the1848 Illinois Constitution.  Hoffman withdrew, and in September 1856, anti-Nebraska  delegates met inSpringfieldand nominatedJohn Woodas their new candidate for lieutenant governor.The Weekly Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 4 June 1856, 2:3; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 191-92;Summary of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Summary of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 25 September 1856, 2:1; J.

Douglas. Buchanan endorsed the Party’s 1856 platform, which, among\n                  other things, vigorously defended the rights of states to maintain the institution\n                  of slavery,   supported thefugitive slave law, and called for an end to anti-slavery agitation. Throughout the1856 Federal Election, many Republicans—including Lincoln—worried that conservative former anti-Nebraska\n                  Democrats might bolt from the nascent Republican Party in favor of Buchanan.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln, 192;Abraham Lincoln to Lyman Trumbull; Jean Baker,James Buchanan, 69; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:421."

The Illinois General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to elect\n                  a U.S. senator. Ten rounds of voting were needed to finally determine the victor.\n                  Gillespie’s reference to Trumbull’s “five particular friends” is a reference toNorman B. Judd,Burton C. Cook,John M. Palmer,Henry S. Baker, andGeorge T. Allen—all of whom refused to vote for Lincoln and instead each cast their ballots for Trumbull\n                  in all ten rounds of voting. In alistof members of the Illinois General Assembly that Lincoln created around January 1855,\n                  he listed all five men as anti-Nebraska Democrats. As Lincoln noted in letters to\n                  political allies after the election, because these five men decided that they “could\n                  never vote for a whig,” he was unable to secure the required votes. Upon realizing\n                  this, Lincoln urged his supporters to cast their ballots for Trumbull so that an anti-Nebraska\n                  candidate could win the senate seat, and Trumbull won the election.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.

This catastrophe has been plainly foreshadowed\n                  ever since the passage of theNebraska bill. The nominee of theCincinnati Conventionis before the people. In bringing him out, a man who had no hand in repealing the\n                  Missouri Compromise, which measure he has publicly declared impolitic—the Cincinnati\n                  Convention has publicly condemned that repeal. But they have placed their candidate\n                  upon an incongruous and dangerous platform, and while he stands upon that platform,\n                  how can he win? What Northern man who is a friend to FreeKansas, can cosistently  support him? True, that party have no regard for platforms, as their traitorous\n                  abandonment of the platform of1852, conclusively proves. That party solemnly pledged themselves to resist all agitation\n                  of the Slavery question in Congress and out, and in less than one year from the inauguration\n                  of theirpresident,electedon that platform, they deliberately opened the most disastrous slavery agitation\n                  that has ever racked the country.10Not so with the Anti-Nebraska Democracy. They have stood by the platform of 1852,\n                  having once endorsed it, and they will not adopt a new platform that conflicts with\n                  such a precedent, neither will they support a candidate who stands upon a platform\n                  that nullifies platform precedents and the compromise akin to that of the constitution.\n                  As great men as Buchanan have been beaten in the presidential race by their inconsistent\n                  political precedents, and what has been, may be again.11"
