        "text": "2Washburne enlisted Joshua R. Giddings in the movement to get Abraham Lincoln elected\n                  to theU.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. He won a seat\n                  in theIllinois House of Representatives, but in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. When the General Assembly met in a\n                  joint session on February 8, 1855, to elect a U.S. senator, ten rounds of voting were\n                  needed to finally determine a victor. Lincoln received a majority of the anti-Nebraska\n                  votes until the tenth and final ballot, when he withdrew and urged his supporters\n                  to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With the votes\n                  of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See1854 Federal Election.Owen Lovejoy was elected to the Nineteenth Illinois House of Representatives representingBureau County.  Washburne and others believed that Lincoln needed the support of Lovejoy and otherFree Soilersin the General Assembly to win the senatorial election, but they were concerned because\n                  Lovejoy  held more radical views on the abolition of slavery than Lincoln.   Jesse\n                  O. Norton and Washburne urged Lincoln to change his position on theCompromise of 1850and theFugitive Slave Lawto improve his prospects among the Free Soilers.  In a letter to LincolndatedDecember 26, 1854, Washburne assured Lincoln that Joshua R. Giddings was writing\n                  Lovejoy with his views on Lincoln’s candidacy to be shared with Free Soilers in the\n                  General Assembly.  When he learned that Lovejoy had not received Gidding’s letter,\n                  WashburneassuredLincoln that Giddings had telegraphed Lovejoy about the letter’s disposition.  Lovejoy\n                  apparently never received Giddings first letter, prompting Gidding to write Lovejoy\n                  a second letter.In alistof members of the Illinois General Assembly   that Lincoln created around January\n                  1855, Lincoln listed Lovejoy as anabolitionist--the only legislator so designated.  Lovejoy voted for Lincoln on the first three\n                  ballots, then switched toWilliam B. Ogdenfor four ballots, before settling on Trumbull on the eighth ballot.The Free West(Chicago, IL), 14 December 1854, 2:3, 4-5; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Louis L.
