We wish it distinctly understood, in the outset of our undertaking, that it isno money speculation. In common with our fellow citizens of the West, we know and feel that a reform\n\nin the administration of the Government, is absolutely necessary; and to effect this,\n\nwe have volunteered our services in laying before the good people ofIllinoisfacts, and a full and fair comparison of the relative merits of the two candidates\n\nnow before the people, for thenext Presidency. We have fixed a price, for the publication, barely sufficient to pay the cost of printing\n\nand mailing; so that after paying our printer, not one cent will be left to us, (if\n\nwe receive 50 cents for every copy issued,) to pay for ink and paper consumed in preparing\n\nour editorials. It will not, therefore, be expected of us, to send the paper to any\n\none that does not pay in advance. The amount is so trifling, that it will not be\n\nexpected. A sense ofduty, and not gain, has impelled us “to push this little boat into the stream.” We feel\n\nthat it is every man’s duty to do all in his power to changebad thingsto better; and this can be done, most certainly, by circulating correct information\n\namong the people; and if we can get money enough to pay our printer, it is all we\n\nask; for the honor and glory of fighting under the glorious banner of theHero of Tippecanoe and Thames, is compensation enough for us. Let all, then, resolve to do their duty. Let those\n\nwho can afford it subscribe for a number of copies, and give them to those that need\n\nlight, but are unable or unwilling to pay for it. Let county committees be vigilant\n\nand active in extending the circulation of the “Old Soldier;” and let every friend of reform and retrenchment be up and doing, and our effortsmustandwillbe crowned with success. We shall publish a large edition of the 1st., so as to be able to supply any demand hereafter for back numbers; and we should\n\nlike extremely well to be compelled to publish a second edition. A subscription has\n\nbeen raised for circulating a few copies gratuitously; consequently, those receiving\n\nit that are not subscribers, will not be charged for the paper, should they continue\n\nto receive it; which we hope they will do.
