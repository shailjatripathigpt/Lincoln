        "text": "3Lincoln references his trip to Washington, DC to lobby for the position of commissioner\n                  of theU.S. General Land Office. Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying for the position. Lincoln entered the competition after learning that\n                  Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. As competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah M. Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. Lincoln arrived on or before June 19.\n                  Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job\n                  went to Butterfield instead.
