He arrived on November 8, 1854 and returned to Springfield on the evening of November\n                  11. Lincoln’s letter to Lamon of November 10, 1854 has not been located,  but was\n                  likely similar to others he wrote around that time requesting his allies’ help in\n                  canvassing theirIllinois General Assemblymembers for support of his potential candidacy for a seat in the U.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.Newly-elected state representative forVermilion CountyJames Courtney did indeed support Lincoln’s bid for the U.S. Senate when the Illinois\n                  General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855 to vote on the matter.\n                  Courtney voted for Lincoln through the first nine rounds of voting. For the tenth\n                  vote, Lincoln withdrew and urged his supporters to vote foranti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. Courtney cast\n                  his vote for Trumbull in the tenth and final round of voting in which the latter emerged\n                  victorious.

Ten of the cases were\n                  settled by agreement to the satisfaction of the landowners and the railroad at that\n                  time, with settlements ranging from $50 to $300. Two cases went to trial at the May\n                  court session and juries awarded damages of $560 to Andrew Makemson (Makenson) and\n                  $372 to James Makemson (Makenson).The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 25 May 1855,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1855-05-25; 30 May 1855,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1855-05-30; 2 June 1855,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1855-06-02;Campbell v.
