On March 29, Lincoln recommended Henry as “his man for register”\n                  in aletterto Secretary of the NavyWilliam B.

Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere among the early contestants. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.Henry was among Lincoln’s friends urging him to travel toWashington, DCto personally lobby for the position.  On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19.While Lincoln was en route, Henry worked to build support for his candidacy in central\n                  and eastern Illinois.
