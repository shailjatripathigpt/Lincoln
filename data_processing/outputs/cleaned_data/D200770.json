        "text": "4The case ofIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parkestemmed from an attempt byMcLean Countyto tax theIllinois Central Railroad Companyon 118 acres of land which the railroad owned in that county. The railroad refused\n                  to pay the $428.57 in taxes levied by the county assessor on the grounds that the\n                  act of the Illinois General Assembly incorporating the railroad exempted it from taxes.\n                  In September 1853, the railroad sued McLean County in theMcLean County Circuit Court, requesting an injunction to prevent the county from selling railroad land to pay\n                  the taxes. The litigants reached an agreement that the court would dismiss the bill,\n                  effectively ruling for McLean County, and the railroad would appeal the case to theIllinois Supreme Courtat the December 1853 term where the only question would be whether the county had\n                  a lawful right to tax Illinois Central Railroad property. Lincoln and Joy represented\n                  the railroad in the appeal. The case was continued from February 28, 1854 to  January\n                  16, 1856, at which point the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s judgment\n                  and JusticeWalter B. Scatesruled that the Illinois General Assembly could exempt property from taxation and\n                  thus the Illinois Central Railroad’s charter was constitutional.Illinois Central RR v.
