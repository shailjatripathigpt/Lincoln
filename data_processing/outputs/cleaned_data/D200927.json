Jonas lived inQuincy, Illinois, at the time.On the day Lincoln wrote this letter, he was representingCharles Chiniquyin the slander caseSpink v. Chiniquyin theChampaign County Circuit Court.    Chiniquy, aCatholicpriest, allegedly continued to tell his congregation thatPeter Spinkhad committed perjury after Spink had been acquitted. Spink accused Chiniquy of slander\n                  in the Kankakee County Circuit Court and requested $10,000 in damages. After a change\n                  of venue to the Champaign County Circuit Court, Chiniquy retained Lincoln for his\n                  defense. Lincoln managed to settle the case before it went to trial and it was dismissed\n                  in October 1856.Lincoln attended and spoke at aRepublicanrally inAtlantaon October 23. Between July and November 1856, Lincoln crisscrossed Illinois canvassing\n                  on behalf of Republican Party candidates for political office. He delivered over fifty\n                  speeches in support of the Republican cause.
