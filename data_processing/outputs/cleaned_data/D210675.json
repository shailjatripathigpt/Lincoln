Ray and Leavitt, as two of the three members of theBoard of Trustees of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, had voted the sum to Leavitt in October of 1857. After the third trustee,William H. Swift, protested, the European bondholders of the canal loan directed their agent in the\n                  United States to file suit in theMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Courtto recover the money from Leavitt.

        "text": "4Stephen A. Douglas had criticized theLecompton Constitutionand PresidentJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in theDemocratic Party. SomeRepublicanswere excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution to the extent\n                  that they considered supporting his bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein 1858 or welcoming him into the Republican Party. Although Douglas later denied\n                  it, he courted Republican support by meeting in person with prominent Republicans\n                  and hinting in correspondence to Republicans that he was finished with the Democratic\n                  Party.Daniel Brainard’s suggestion to Ray that Douglas drop his bid for reelection to the\n                  U.S. Senate to run instead for a seat in theU.S. House of Representativeswith the combined support of anti-Lecompton Democrats and Republicans was one of\n                  a number of such possibilities discussed regarding Douglas in 1858 asIllinoisRepublicans and Democrats sought advantage against the background of shifting party\n                  allegiances. Brainard’s proposal, which would have given Douglas Republican support\n                  while still allowing Republicans to back Lincoln for Douglas’ U.S. Senate seat in\n                  theelection of 1858, was apparently not sanctioned by Douglas, and Brainard himself split with Douglas\n                  to ally with Buchanan Democrats in the summer of 1858.Buchanan had long desired the United States’ acquisition of Cuba fromSpain. In his second annual message in December, 1858, he laid out a case to theU.S. Congressfor acquiring Cuba. A proposal in Congress to negotiate for the purchase of Cuba\n                  was introduced early in 1859, but was defeated by Republicans opposed to the admission\n                  of Cuba to the United States as a territory where slavery was legal. Buchanan continued\n                  to propose purchasing Cuba in his subsequent annual messages but lacked sufficient\n                  Congressional support for the issue. Douglas had also been a longtime proponent of\n                  the annexation of Cuba.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-50; Robert W.
