        "text": "4Since Fithian’s letter to Lincoln has not been located, some of the context for this\n                  reply that Lincoln gave Fithian is missing. However, extant legal documents reveal\n                  that in January 1855, Fithian sued William Carroll and Silas McDougal in theVermilion County Circuit Courtfor a debt of $160 and another $100 in damages.Fithian apparently heeded Lincoln’s advice. In May 1855, the Vermilion County Circuit\n                  Court dismissed the suit against Carroll and McDougal at Fithian’s expense. However,\n                  there is no evidence that Fithian filed a new suit in either an action of covenant\n                  or against the estate of the original debtor.Summons, Document ID: 131950; Order, Document ID: 131951,Lincoln provided legal advice to Fithian, Martha L.
