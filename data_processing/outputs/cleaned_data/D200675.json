        "text": "3Lincoln refers to legal precedents in stock subscription cases inNew York, Alabama, and Kentucky in connection with legal work for the directors of theAlton & Sangamon Railroad Company, which had retainedLincoln & Herndonto collect balances due on shares of capital stock purchased by stockholders.TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in February 1847 to construct and operate a railroad between\n                  Alton, Illinois, viaNew Berlin, and Springfield, Illinois.  Section two  of the company’s charter allowed the incorporators\n                  to issue $500,000 in stock at $100 per share, and section six required subscribers\n                  to purchase stock by paying $5 on each share subscribed at the time of subscribing\n                  and the balance in installments called for by a board of directors. The incorporators\n                  opened subscription for stock in May 1847.  Many stock subscribers owned property\n                  near the proposed route. On January 29, 1851, however, the General Assembly altered\n                  the charter to allow the company to construct the road on a more direct route, bypassing\n                  the property of several stockholders.  Believing that the change in route voided their\n                  subscription agreements, several investors refused to pay their remaining installments,\n                  and the company  hired Lincoln & Herndon to collect the full subscriptions.  Several\n                  of the delinquent subscribers were fromSangamon County, Illinois, and thirty-seven were fromMadison County, Illinois.  Martin was among the incorporators.The Troy Turnpike & Railroad Company v. M’Chesney, N.Y. (21 Wendell) (1839) 295-300;Selma & Tennessee Railroad v. Tipton, 5 Ala. (1843) 787-810;Beene v.
