        "text": "3While stumping in the South forLewis Cassduring thepresidential election of 1848, Stephen A. Douglas delivered a speech in early June inNew Orleanswhere he  affirmed that he would resign his seat in theU.S. Senateif theIllinois General Assemblypassed a resolution instructing him to vote for theWilmot Proviso.  TheDemocratic Partywon huge majorities in both houses of the General Assembly in the state elections\n                  of 1848, but many Democrats from the northern part of the state sympathized with theFree Soil Party, and hoped to convince their brethren from the southern part of the state to adopt\n                  the free soil cause.  Disaffected Democrats, together with theWhigs, launched a campaign to test Douglas’ resolve on the Wilmot Proviso in hopes of unseating\n                  him.  In January 1849, the General Assembly adopted a resolution instructing the state’s\n                  senators to use all the means in their disposition to enact legislation for the territories\n                  acquired fromMexico“as shall contain the express declaration, that there shall be neither slavery, nor\n                  involuntary servitude in said territories...”    Douglas dutifully introduced the\n                  resolution in the Senate, where it was tabled.  He did not resign, arguing that the\n                  resolution did not go as far as the Wilmot Proviso, and reasoning that it was his\n                  duty to remain, as his resignation would only result in a freesoiler succeeding him.Illinois Journal(Springfield), 22 June 1848, 2:5; 15 November 1848, 4:1; Robert W.
