But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not\n                  therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. Whosoever therefore shall confess\n                  me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.”Matthew 10:29-32."

        "text": "7Johnston’s reply, if he penned one, has not been located.It is possible that Lincoln did not initially believe his father’s condition was as\n                  serious as Johnston and Chapman claimed. In May 1849, Johnston andAugustus Chapman, Harriett’s husband, had written Lincoln, claiming thatThomas Lincolnwas gravely ill and asking to see Lincoln. But Augustus ChapmanwroteLincoln again after Thomas Lincoln had recovered, apologized for troubling Lincoln\n                  with the false news that Thomas Lincoln had severe heart trouble, and reported that\n                  a doctor determined his father’s illness had been related to the lungs rather than\n                  the heart.In 1851, however, Thomas Lincoln’s condition was indeed serious. Five days after Lincoln\n                  wrote this letter to Johnston, Thomas Lincoln died. Lincoln did not attend his father’s\n                  funeral.Augustus H.
