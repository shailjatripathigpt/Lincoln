        "text": "5John L. Scripps andHenry C. Whitneyalso wrote Lincoln informing him of theDaily Chicago Times’ attacks on his congressional record related to the Mexican War and asked him to\n                  supply a response. Lincolnrepliedto Whitney on June 24, but no reply to Scripps has been located. Lincolnrepliedto this letter from Medill on June 25, supplying detailed information to refute theDaily Chicago Times’ claims. He also corresponded with Medill several more times regarding various aspects\n                  of the election campaign of 1858.TheChicago Daily Tribunepublished a general defense of Lincoln in its June 24 edition, while also admitting\n                  that the editors did not then know whether Lincoln “did or not vote against that war.”\n                  The paper published a thorough refutation of theDaily Chicago Times’ attack upon Lincoln in its June 26 issue. Although Lincoln opposed the Mexican War\n                  and questioned its constitutionality during his time in the U.S. House, he nevertheless\n                  voted in favor of supplies for U.S. troops on at least two occasions: February 17\n                  and March 8, 1848. In both instances, the bills Lincoln voted for passed the U.S.\n                  Senate and became law, funneling aid in the form of money, food, clothing, medical\n                  supplies, and the like to U.S. military personnel serving inMexico.Despite publication of the facts surrounding Lincoln's voting record in the U.S. House\n                  in the Illinois press as early as June 25, 1858—including by Democratic newspapers—Douglas\n                  repeated theDaily Chicago Times' claims throughout the election campaign of 1858. In speeches he delivered during\n                  the campaign, including during theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln repeatedly refuted the charges and cited congressional records to back up\n                  his voting record in the U.S. House.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Ray, Medill & Company to Abraham Lincoln;Joseph Medill to Abraham Lincoln; Joseph Medill to Abraham Lincoln;John L.
