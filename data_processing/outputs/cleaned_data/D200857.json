        "text": "3Lincoln references the controversy over allowing slavery in theArkansas Territory.  WhileCongressconsidered legislation creating  Missouri as a state, settlers living below the southern\n                  boundary of the proposed state began petitioning Congress for a new state of their\n                  own.  In December 1818, Robertson, then a member of theU.S. House of Representatives, introduced a resolution to inquire into the expediency of creating the Territory\n                  of Arkansas.  The House adopted this resolution, and on December 21, 1818, Robertson\n                  introduced a bill to establish a separate territorial government for Arkansas.  On\n                  February 18, 1819, Representative John Taylor moved to amend the bill by adding a\n                  section prohibiting the further introduction of slavery into the proposed territory\n                  and freeing children of slaves born in the territory at the age of twenty-five.  The\n                  Taylor amendment was similar to the amendment proposed by Representative John Tallmadge\n                  to the Missouri enabling bill.  During the ensuing debate, Robertson delivered a lengthy\n                  speech opposing congressional interference with slavery in Arkansas.  The House of\n                  Representatives rejected the prohibition portion of Taylor’s amendment by a vote of\n                  70 yeas to 71 nays but adopted the portion calling for the gradual emancipation of\n                  slave children by a vote of 75 yeas to 73 nays.  On February 19, Robertson motioned\n                  that the House refer the bill to a select committee with instructions to delete the\n                  part of Taylor’s amendment adopted the previous day.  The House deadlocked on this\n                  motion, 88 yeas to 88 nays, with Speaker Henry Clay casting his vote in the  affirmative.\n                  The select committee reported back the bill with the instructed deletion, and the\n                  House passed it by a vote of 89 yeas to 87 nays.  TheU.S. Senateconcurred, and on March 2, PresidentJames Monroesigned into law  the bill without slavery restrictions.U.S. HouseJournal. 1818-1819. 15th Cong., 2nd sess., 119, 283-86, 289-90, 291-92, 352; William R.

        "text": "4Lincoln references the failure of the anti-slavery movement in Kentucky to include\n                  emancipation in the new constitution enacted in 1850.  Emancipationists and abolitionists\n                  in Kentucky had clamored for many years for a constitutional convention,  believing\n                  the convention would exclude slavery from the new constitution, opening the door for\n                  emancipation.   Proponents for a constitutional convention succeeded in getting a\n                  convention in 1849.  Debate over slavery reached its height in the summer of 1849,\n                  as pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces battled to elect delegates to the convention.\n                  Delegates sympathetic to slavery secured a slight majority in the convention, and\n                  they used their majority to increase protections for slavery in the forthcoming constitution.James C.
