But I will not argue farther– I perhaps ought to say that individually I never was\n\nmuch interested in the\n\nTexas question– I never could see much good to come of annexation; inasmuch, as they\n\nwere already a free\n\nrepublican people on our own model; on the other hand, I never could very clearly\n\nsee how the annexation\n\nwould augment the evil of slavery– It always seemed to me that slaves would be taken\n\nthere in about\n\nequal numbers, with or without annexation– And if moreweretaken\n\nbecause of annexation, still there would be just so many the fewer left, where they\n\nwere taken from– It\n\nis possibly true, to some extent, that with annexation, some slaves may be sent to\n\nTexas and continued\n\nin slavery, that otherwise might have been liberated– To whatever extent this may\n\nbe true, I think\n\nannexation an evil– I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the free states, due\n\nto the Union of the\n\nstates, and perhaps to libertyitselfitself (paradox though it may\n\nseem) to let the slavery of the other states alone; while, on the other hand, I hold\n\nit to be equally\n\nclear, that we should never knowingly lend ourselves directly or indirectly, to prevent\n\nthat slavery\n\nfrom dying a natural death—to find new places for it to live in, when it can no longer\n\nexist\n\nin the old– Of course I am not now considering what would be our duty, in cases of\n\ninsurrectionsamong\n\nthe slaves– To recur to the Texas question, I understand the Liberty men to have viewed\n\nannexation as a\n\nmuch<Page 3>greater evil than I ever did; and I, would like to convince you if I could, that they\n\ncould have prevented it, without violation of principle if they had chosen– I intend this letter for you and Madison together; and if you and he, or either, shall\n\nthink fit to drop\n\nme a line, I shall be pleased–",

The Liberty Party polled 15,812 in New York; had Clay received only\n                  a third of those votes, he would have won. Some Whigs attributed Clay’s loss to the\n                  Liberty Party and the refusal of abolitionists to vote for Clay, though other Whigs\n                  blame Clay’s loss on his waffling on the annexation of Texas. \n                  Anti-annexation Whigs and abolitionist voters opposed the annexation of Texas due\n                  to the existence of slavery in the territory, on the grounds that its annexation would\n                  allow the extension of slavery and cause sectional controversy.Michael F.
