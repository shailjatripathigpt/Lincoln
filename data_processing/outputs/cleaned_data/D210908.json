        "text": "2Oglesby is discussing Lincoln’s speaking engagements between September 2, in Clinton,\n                  Illinois, and September 7, in Paris, Illinois. He was scheduled to speak in Bloomington,\n                  Illinois, on September 4 and Monticello, Illinois, on September 6. Lincoln was traveling\n                  throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering public addresses in support of\n                  candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At the time, he was theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replaceDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senate. Both Lincoln and Douglas were highly attuned to the state legislative races in 1858\n                  because members of the Illinois General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore the outcome of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the U.S. Senaterace.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 6 August 1858, 2:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

        "text": "4Lincoln traveled from Springfield, Illinois, to Decatur, Illinois, on September 1,\n                  then from Decatur to Clinton on the morning train on September 2. Upon his arrival,\n                  enthusiastic citizens in Clinton insisted that he go on toWapella, Illinois, so that they could escort him back to Clinton with fanfare. He arrived in Bloomington\n                  on September 3, stayed overnight, spoke in Bloomington on September 4, then caught\n                  the train back to Springfield that evening with a stop inLincoln, Illinois, to hear Douglas speak. After resting in Springfield on September 5, Lincoln traveled\n                  to Monticello on September 6, then on to both Mattoon and Paris, Illinois on September\n                  7. In all, it appears that Lincoln traveled primarily by train rather than by train\n                  and road, as Oglesby advised.Newspaper accounts of Lincoln’s scheduled address in Paris, Illinois, do not mention\n                  Oglesby speaking to the crowd before Lincoln arrived. According to theChicago Tribune,James MillerandOwen Lovejoyboth unexpectedly arrived in the city on the morning train to hear Lincoln speak.\n                  Upon urging from some in the crowd Lovejoy delivered an impromptu address for roughly\n                  half an hour, until the procession escorting Lincoln from the train depot arrived\n                  and Lincoln took the stand to speak. Both Lovejoy and Oglesby addressed the crowd\n                  at the local court house later that evening.In Illinois’s local elections of 1858, Republicans ultimately won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate.  Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition and respect within the national Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=9; Report of Speech at Clinton, Illinois; Report of Speech at Bloomington, Illinois; Report of Speech at Paris, Illinois;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 9 September 1858, 2:2;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 6 September 1858, 2:4; 11 September 1858, 2:5; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life1:556-57; Allen C.
