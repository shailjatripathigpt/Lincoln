        "text": "3Pre-emption refers to “the right of a settler of a tract of public land to purchase\n                  it before other applicants.” Lincoln had previouslywrittento Brackett on May 18, 1857, regarding  the pre-emption claims ofJacob WarnerandCyrus Conkling. The pair were among a group of men local toRock Island Countywho acted together in the spring of 1857 to attempt to claim land on the island ofRock Island. Warner and Conkling both settled on the island on April 10, 1857, and through Lincoln\n                  filed declaratory statements of pre-emption at theSpringfield Land Officeon May 9. Rock Island, however, was subject to competing claims of ownership, some\n                  by earlier settlers who had apparently failed to file pre-emption claims, and arguments\n                  ensued. Following this unsuccessful attempt by Lincoln to file proofs of pre-emption\n                  for Warner and Conkling with Springfield Land Office registerJohn Connelly, Sr., members of Warner’s and Conkling’s group went to Springfield themselves in April\n                  1858 to prove title. TheGeneral Land OfficeinWashington, DCprohibited further action at that time, however, and announced that theU.S. War Departmentintended to sell the land at public auction as a military reservation. Ownership\n                  of land on Rock Island was still unsettled on the advent of the Civil War, but when\n                  theU.S. Congressestablished an arsenal on the island in 1862, the remaining settlers relinquished\n                  their pre-emption claims.“Pre-emption,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
