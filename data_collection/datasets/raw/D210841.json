In the summer and fall of 1858, Lincoln crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches\n                  and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.

There is a physical\n                  difference between the two, which in my judgment will probably forever forbid their\n                  living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a\n                  necessity that there must be a difference. I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor\n                  of the race to which I belong, having the superior position. I have never said anything\n                  to the contrary, but I hold that notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the\n                  world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration\n                  of Independence, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"First Debate with Stephen A.

        "text": "7As theKansas Territoryinched toward statehood, the issue of whether or not slavery would be legal inKansasbecame a polarizing debate. TheKansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, supported by Douglas, overturned theMissouri Compromiseexcluding slavery in the territory and established that the question would be determined\n                  by popular sovereignty, or the right of a states’ voters to determine whether or not\n                  that state would allow slavery. Prior to 1854, popular sovereignty had the potential\n                  to block the extension of slavery in a politically benign way; Douglas's new use of\n                  the doctrine discredited it in the eyes of possible antislavery supporters. It also\n                  set off a firestorm of violence as outsiders tried to exert their influence. Slaveholders\n                  inMissouriwere particularly active in these efforts, and Missourians crossed the border into\n                  Kansas to vote in Kansas elections and commit acts of intimidation and violence.
