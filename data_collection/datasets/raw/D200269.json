        "text": "1On November 23, 1840, GovernorThomas Carlincalled theGeneral Assemblyinto special session two weeks before it was constitutionally mandated to gather\n                  to tackle the state debt crisis brought on by thePanic of 1837and large expenditure on theinternal improvement system.As theHouse of Representativesdebated various legislative remedies, it pursued other measures to ensure that the\n                  state would not default on the January 1 interest payment.  On December 2, the House\n                  adopted aresolutioncreating a joint select committee to confer with the President and Directors of the\n                  State Bank of Illinois to discern as to whether the bank would loan the state money,\n                  and if so willing, at what interest rate, to pay the January interest on the public\n                  debt.  The House placed Lincoln and two others on this committee, but the Senate took\n                  no action. On the same day, the House adopted anotherresolutionrequesting the Fund Commissioner to report on the amount of interest due on January\n                  1, 1841.  On December 3,Richard F. Barrett, the fund commissioner, reported the semi-annual interest on the state’s $5,852,000\n                  debt, due January 1 and July 1, was $175,560, making the state liable for $175,560\n                  on January 1.The special session--known as Session 12-1-ended on December 7 without any substantive\n                  legislation.  On December 15, 1840, the General Assembly passed anactmaking provision for the payment of the interest due on the internal improvement\n                  debt on  January 1. During   adebateon this legislation on December 12, Lincoln spoke in support of it as a stopgap measure\n                  to pay the January interest. During debate on December 15, representatives echoed\n                  similar sentiments, though some voiced concern about the absence of additional tax\n                  revenue, arguing that the State should either raise property taxes or sell public\n                  lands and deposit the receipts into a permanent fund from which the state would make\n                  future interest payments. Theactonly provided for payment of January interest; as Richard F. Barrett reported on\n                  December 3, the state would have to make another interest payment of $175,560 on July\n                  1.   Debate in January and February centered on legislation for the July interest\n                  and a permanent solution.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G.

The House appointed Abraham Lincoln and six others to\n                  this committee, then added two additional members, making it a select committee of\n                  nine. On February 23, 1841, the select committee of nine issued majority and minority\n                  reports in response to theresolution.Cyrus Edwardsissued the majority report;Leander Munsellissued the minority report.
