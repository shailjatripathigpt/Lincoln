Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, presumed Lincoln was referring here to a letter of recommendation which John Addison\n                  tore off from this letter and used for his purposes. The original letter, however,\n                  shows no evidence of a portion being torn off, and Lincoln’s supposed letter of recommendation\n                  for Addison has not been located, so it is impossible to verify Basler’s assertion.No letter from Addison to Lincoln in the months of May through July 1849 has been\n                  located; therefore, some of the context for this letter is missing."

Lucas, who held a temporary position as a clerk in the U.S. General Land\n                  Office during the affair, supported Lincoln in the competition for the appointment.\n                  After Butterfield won the appointment, LucaswroteLincoln, concerned that Butterfield might not retain him as a clerk. In a November\n                  1849letterto Lucas, Lincoln wrote that he was glad  Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewinghad “sustained” Lucas in his position.

Ewing complied, returning all but three of the letters from Lincoln’s file.\n                  Lincoln suspected that  letters byRichard W. ThompsonandElisha Embreewere purposefully omitted by someone at the Department of the Interior in order to\n                  give Butterfield an advantage over him in the competition for the job. However,  he\n                  laterwroteJohn Addisonthat his loyalty to both Taylor and “the greatwhigcause” induced him to remain silent about his suspicions.Eventually, on April 22, 1850, theDemocrat-controlledU.S. House of Representativesformed a committee underWilliam A. Richardsonto investigate Ewing’s role in and handling of patronage appointments as well as\n                  his management of pension payments and Department of the Interior accounts. On June\n                  8, 1850, theNew York Heraldreported that Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office was one patronage appointment that the Richardson Committee was investigating,\n                  particularly with regard to letters missing from the file on Lincoln that was shown\n                  to President Taylor prior to Taylor selecting the final appointee. However, when the\n                  Committee filed its final reports on September 4-7, 1850, it made no finding regarding\n                  Butterfield’s appointment. The Whig-controlledU.S. Senatealso exonerated Ewing of all charges, although suspicions remained in some Whig circles\n                  that Ewing had indeed suppressed letters of recommendation from Lincoln’s  file.Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Cong.
