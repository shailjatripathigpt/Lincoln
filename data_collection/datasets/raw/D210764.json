        "text": "3Hanna references an ongoing dispute betweenStephen A. Douglasand PresidentJames Buchanan. The dispute began after Douglas, in December 1857, spoke out against theLecompton Constitutionand criticized President Buchanan for supporting it. Some Republicans were excited\n                  by Douglas’ actions and considered supporting his bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Election. Although he later denied it, Douglas actively courted Republican support in order\n                  to bolster his chances for reelection. Lincoln and other Republicans were concerned\n                  by this and urged fellow party members to remain loyal in the upcoming local and federal\n                  elections.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-48."

        "text": "5Lincolnrepliedto this letter on July 15.Douglas spoke in Bloomington, Illinois the evening of Friday, July 16. Lincoln was\n                  present. When Douglas concluded his speech, the crowd  called for Lincoln to deliver\n                  a reply. Lincoln declined, stating that since the meeting was “called by the friends\n                  ofJudge Douglas. . . it would be improper for me to address it.” Lincoln delivered a campaign address\n                  in Bloomington before a Republican crowd on September 4.For a time, Lincoln followed Douglas on the campaign trail, delivering speeches either\n                  later in the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. This posed challenges,\n                  however, as many spectators were unwilling to devote long hours or days to campaign\n                  events.Democratsalso attacked Lincoln as “desperate” for following in Douglas’ footsteps. On July\n                  24, Lincoln challenged Douglas to a series of formal debates. Douglas agreed, and\n                  these became theLincoln-Douglas Debates.In Illinois’ local elections of that year, the voters of McLean County awarded a healthy\n                  majority of 54.1 percent toOwen Lovejoy, the Third Congressional District’s Republican candidate for theU.S. House of Representatives. He won the district overall with 57.7 percent of the total votes cast. When the\n                  full elections results came in, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in thestate, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Douglas won reelection to the U.S.\n                  Senate. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing\n                  within the Republican Party.The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 17 July 1858, 3:2; 6 September 1858, 2:2; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:483-85, 556-57;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A.
