In addition, no correspondence has been located between\n                  Lincoln and Archibald Williams in July 1855 that might indicate what legal case Lincoln\n                  is discussing.Lincoln and Williams each participated in the caseForsyth v. Peoriain Chicago, Illinois in July 1855. However, little information about the case is\n                  extant, and there is no indication in the information available that any John M. Walker\n                  was involved in the case. For details on this case, seeForsyth v. Peoria, Martha L.
