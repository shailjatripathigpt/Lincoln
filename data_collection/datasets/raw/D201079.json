        "text": "3Texas was admitted into the United States as a state in 1845, but theU.S. Congressstipulated that “New states, of convenient size, not exceeding four in number, in\n                  addition to said State of Texas, and having sufficient population, may hereafter,\n                  by the consent of said State, be formed out of the territory thereof, which shall\n                  be entitled to admission under the provisions of the federal constitution.” All additional\n                  states south of 36°30′, the line dividing prospective free and slave states according\n                  to theMissouri Compromise, could enter the Union as slave states if the citizens so desired--a provision that\n                  promised the South additional power in Congress.In hisletterto Lincoln, Dummer suggested that Lincoln “disclaim the position” that the Republican\n                  Party was opposed to the admission of another slave state and instead focus on opposing\n                  “the admission of slavery into territory where it does not exist.” Dummer cited Texas\n                  as a case that the Republicans should grant an exception for—“if Texas should be divided\n                  & a new State formed”—because “slavery has gone to Texas with the common understanding\n                  that that territory was open to slavery.”The charge that the Republican Party’s platform declared that it “was pledged never\n                  to admit another slave State into the Union” was one that Douglas later repeated during\n                  theLincoln-Douglas Debates. In reality, during the1858 Illinois Republican Convention, although the Illinois Republican Party passed a number of resolutions, none either\n                  called for or committed the party’s representatives to vote against the admission\n                  of another slave state into the Union. Instead, the party passed a resolution opposed\n                  to the extension of slavery into U.S. territories and criticized the recentU.S. Supreme Courtdecision in theDred Scott caseas “political heresy” for the Court’s assertion that U.S. Congress had no authority\n                  to regulate slavery within the territories.In the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and, in the1858 Federal Election, Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through\n                  his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well\n                  as standing within the national Republican Party.“Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States,” 1 March 1845,Statutes at Large of the United States5 (1856):798; Michael F.
