        "text": "2Rushville, located inSchuyler County, belonged to the Fifth Congressional District ofIllinois. In state politics, Rushville was part of the Eleventh Senate District, which was\n                  composed of Hancock,Henderson, and Schuyler counties, and the Thirtieth House District, encompassing Schuyler County\n                  only.Abraham Lincoln was the Republican candidate forU.S. Senate, so the outcomes of the party convention in Schuyler County and the Fifth Congressional\n                  District were of interest to him.   In the summer and fall of 1858, Lincoln crisscrossed\n                  Illinois delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for\n                  theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to, DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. See1858 Federal Election.The Republican convention of the Fifth District, held in Augusta on August 25, nominatedJackson GrimshawofPike CountyforCongress. Bagby was nominated for the Eleventh Senate District.    On September 6, Lincolnwroteto Bagby emphasizing the necessity of a win. Although Bagby won in Henderson County,\n                  receiving 1,005 votes to hisDemocraticopponentJohn P. Richmond’s 758 votes, Bagby lost in Hancock County,  2,031 to 2,340 and in Schuyler County,\n                  1,076 to 1,480 votes. All told, Bagby lost the state senate seat to Richmond, 4,112\n                  to 4,578 votes.  Richmond voted for Douglas in the U.S. Senate election.  In the congressional\n                  race, Grimshaw lost toIsaac N. Morris, the incumbent.Combined History of Schuyler and Brown Counties, Illinois(Philadelphia: W. R. Brink, 1882), 79; Howard W.
