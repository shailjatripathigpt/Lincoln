    "full_text": "Report of Speech at Taunton, Massachusetts, [21] September 18481 TheTaylormen were well entertained Wednesday evening, the 20th inst., at Union Hall, by an\n               address from the Hon.Abraham LincolnofIllinois.2The address as well as the speaker was such as to give unlimited satisfaction to\n               the disheartened Taylorites.  Such a treat it is indeed seldom their good luck to\n               get, and they were in ecstasies! At former meetings their spirits were too low for\n               a good hearty cheer, but on this occasion ‘the steam was up.’ It was reviving to hear\n               a man speak as if he believed what he was saying and had a grain or two of feeling\n               mixed up with it; one who could not only speak highly of Taylor, but could occasionally\n               swell with indignation or burst in hatred on theFree Soilers.  When political spite runs high nothing can be too pungent or severe, and the speaker\n               is appreciated in proportion as his statements are rash and unscrupulous.  So it was\n               on this occasion.  The speaker was far inferior as a reasoner to others who hold the\n               same views, but then he was more unscrupulous, more facetious and with his sneers\n               he mixed up a good<Page 2>deal of humor.  His awkward gesticulations, the ludicrous management of his voice\n               and the comical expression of his countenance, all conspired to make his hearers laugh\n               at the mere anticipation of the joke before it appeared.  But enough concerning the\n               speaker; let us examine his arguments. General Taylor, he argued,hasprinciples, though he has not given expression to them on the Tariff, Bank and other\n               questions of policy.3This, however, is in direct contradiction of Taylor, himself, who in his letter\n               toDelanywrites, ‘As regards the second and third inquiries (about a bank and tariff), I am\n               not prepared to answer them.I could only do so after investigating them.  I am no politician; near forty years of my life have been passed on the Western\n               frontier and in the Indian county.’4The speaker next discussed the veto question and said that Taylor was the firstWhigcandidate that had come fully up to the Whig platform in this point, because unlike\n               all other candidates before him he had not even claimed the right to adviseCongresson matters of policy.  The proper limitation  of the veto, he contended, was the\n               Whig platform itself, and General Taylor by his equivocal silence had come up to it\n               better than the great parent of Whig principles—Henry Clay.5He did not know that General Taylor had professed that he wouldnotveto theWilmot proviso, butbelievedthat he would not, because General Taylor had promised not to veto any measure unless\n               it was unconstitutional or passed in haste and acknowledged that to be constitutional\n               which had been established by long usage and acquiesced in by the people.  As the\n               constitutionality of the Wilmot Proviso he said ‘had never been disputed,’ it was\n               therefore acquiesced in by the people and consequently Taylor was bound not to veto\n               it.6 He subsequently admitted in speaking ofCass, that in the Nicholson letter the constitutional power of Congress to exclude slavery\n               from any territory in the Union was denied.7Yet he seemed to forget this when he said that the constitutionality of the Proviso\n               had never been disputed. He seemed to be entirely ignorant that every propagandist\n               of slavery in existence, withJohn C. Calhounat their head, claimed the right, under the Constitution, and independent of Congress,\n               to carry their ‘property’ into any part of the United States territory and there to\n               hold it.8 Calhoun said in theSenatethat when the South consented to theMissouri Compromisethe rights of the South granted by the Constitution were given up but belonged to\n               the South the same as if no compromise had been made.9Thomas Corwinsaid in his speech on the Compromise Bill introduced in the Senate last session of\n               Congress that the constitutionality of any measure excluding slavery from the territories\n               could not with safety be left to the decision of theSupreme Court.10TheHouse of Representativeshad the same views and rejected the bill.11None of these facts did the speaker allude to, but instead uttered the stupendous\n               falsehood that the ‘constitutionality of the Proviso’ had never been disputed.  Without\n               this ‘whopper,’ however, the argument would have been defective.  There would have\n               been a gap in it, so the lie was made big enough to fill the gap that the argument\n               might thereby be made sound and conclusive. He related a conversation which he overheard at the dinner table of a house in Lowell between two Free Soilers.  One of them remarked that the reasoning of the Taylor\n               men was not logical, for it certainly was illogical to say, ‘General Taylor is a slaveholder,\n               therefore we go for him to prevent the extension of slavery.’ He thought this was\n               an unfair statement of the case and gave what he deemed the correct one in the form\n               of a syllogism as follows: ‘General Taylor is a slaveholder, but he will do more to\n               prevent the extension of slavery than any other man whom it is possible to elect;\n               therefore we go for Taylor.’ It needs no argument to prove that the major proposition does not include the minor\n               and has nothing to do with it.  But let that pass.  The minor proposition asserts\n               that General Taylor will do ‘more’ to prevent the extension of slavery than any other man it is possible to elect,\n               and this assertion is made before the<Page 3>logician has even attempted to prove that General Taylor was opposed to the extension\n               of slavery at all!  The attempt is made to prove that he will domorethan any other man before it is proved that he will do the first thing.  But taking\n               for granted that General Taylor will not veto the Proviso (a position founded on a\n               lie) is that a proof that he will do anything to prevent the extension of slavery?\n               He may never have a chance to veto the Proviso even ifelected in November.  The slave states are equal with the free states in the Senate and before the Proviso\n               can pass that body one or two of the Southern Senators must yield. Under such circumstances, is it likely that any Senator from the South will be influenced\n               to vote for the Proviso by the executive patronage of the unrepentant slaveholder,\n               Zachary Taylor?  Is it not more probable that it would be brought to bear on some\n               Northern doughface?12It would be quite safe for Taylor to make an equivocal promise not to veto the Proviso,\n               but he has not even done so much as that.  The speaker contended thatVan Burenhad approved the policy of theMexican Warand the annexation of new territory.  This he did not prove from Van Buren’s letter\n               written in 1844.  If he had read that letter to his hearers they would have found\n               that Van Buren wroteagainstannexation, partly because it would produce war. The proof he gave was the fact that\n               some of the same individuals whosupported Van Buren in 1844had since voted both forTexasandwar.13 He said in another part of his speech that the NorthernDemocratswere opposed to the annexation of Texas in 1844.  Yet he undertook to prove that\n               Van Buren was in favor of annexation and war from the fact that these men once supported\n               him and that at the very time they themselves were opposed to annexation.  But why\n               should Van Buren be held responsible for all his friends?  Where is the proof that\n               he ever favored the extension of slavery in all his life? Is General Taylor responsible\n               for all who now support him?  Are the sins ofBerrienMangumand other propagandists of slavery to be laid to his charge? He has enough to answer\n               for on his own account if we acquit him of all guilt connected with the Native Church\n               burning ofPhiladelphia.14 To show the recklessness and audacity of the honorable gentleman and the low estimate\n               he had formed of his hearers, it will suffice to give but one specimen.  Speaking\n               of Van Buren, he said ‘he (Van Buren) won’t have an electoral vote in the nation nor\n               as many as all others in any county in the nation.’15The reasoning adopted by the Whig Free Soilers he gave in the form of a syllogism\n               as follows: ‘We can’t go for General Taylor because he is not a Whig.  Van Buren is\n               not a Whig; therefore, we go for him.’ This dishonest statement of the case elicited\n               warm applause from his truth-loving hearers.  The syllogism should have stood thus:\n               We can’t vote for a man without principles.  General Taylor has got none, and Van\n               Buren has, at least, got one good Whig principle; therefore, we go for Van Buren against\n               Taylor. For the benefit of those who are like the speaker, always misrepresenting the Free\n               Soil Party, I will define our position in a pro-syllogism.  Theabolitionof slavery in the territory of the United States can never be accomplished unless\n               the North is united.  But the North cannot be united until old party lines are broken\n               down.  But these lines cannot be broken down unless every man is willing to sacrifice\n               his attachment to minor questions and make opposition to slavery the leading idea;\n               therefore, we have come out of the old pro-slavery parties and formed the United Party\n               of the North.",

Such a treat it is indeed seldom their good luck to\n               get, and they were in ecstasies! At former meetings their spirits were too low for\n               a good hearty cheer, but on this occasion ‘the steam was up.’ It was reviving to hear\n               a man speak as if he believed what he was saying and had a grain or two of feeling\n               mixed up with it; one who could not only speak highly of Taylor, but could occasionally\n               swell with indignation or burst in hatred on theFree Soilers.  When political spite runs high nothing can be too pungent or severe, and the speaker\n               is appreciated in proportion as his statements are rash and unscrupulous.  So it was\n               on this occasion.  The speaker was far inferior as a reasoner to others who hold the\n               same views, but then he was more unscrupulous, more facetious and with his sneers\n               he mixed up a good<Page 2>deal of humor.

I am no politician; near forty years of my life have been passed on the Western\n               frontier and in the Indian county.’4The speaker next discussed the veto question and said that Taylor was the firstWhigcandidate that had come fully up to the Whig platform in this point, because unlike\n               all other candidates before him he had not even claimed the right to adviseCongresson matters of policy.  The proper limitation  of the veto, he contended, was the\n               Whig platform itself, and General Taylor by his equivocal silence had come up to it\n               better than the great parent of Whig principles—Henry Clay.5He did not know that General Taylor had professed that he wouldnotveto theWilmot proviso, butbelievedthat he would not, because General Taylor had promised not to veto any measure unless\n               it was unconstitutional or passed in haste and acknowledged that to be constitutional\n               which had been established by long usage and acquiesced in by the people.  As the\n               constitutionality of the Wilmot Proviso he said ‘had never been disputed,’ it was\n               therefore acquiesced in by the people and consequently Taylor was bound not to veto\n               it.6"

He has enough to answer\n               for on his own account if we acquit him of all guilt connected with the Native Church\n               burning ofPhiladelphia.14"

Speaking\n               of Van Buren, he said ‘he (Van Buren) won’t have an electoral vote in the nation nor\n               as many as all others in any county in the nation.’15The reasoning adopted by the Whig Free Soilers he gave in the form of a syllogism\n               as follows: ‘We can’t go for General Taylor because he is not a Whig.  Van Buren is\n               not a Whig; therefore, we go for him.’ This dishonest statement of the case elicited\n               warm applause from his truth-loving hearers.  The syllogism should have stood thus:\n               We can’t vote for a man without principles.  General Taylor has got none, and Van\n               Buren has, at least, got one good Whig principle; therefore, we go for Van Buren against\n               Taylor."

Theabolitionof slavery in the territory of the United States can never be accomplished unless\n               the North is united.  But the North cannot be united until old party lines are broken\n               down.  But these lines cannot be broken down unless every man is willing to sacrifice\n               his attachment to minor questions and make opposition to slavery the leading idea;\n               therefore, we have come out of the old pro-slavery parties and formed the United Party\n               of the North."
