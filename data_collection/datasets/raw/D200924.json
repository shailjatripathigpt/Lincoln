        "text": "2Lincoln had been absent from  Springfield from September 16 through September 24,\n                  1856, giving speeches inBloomington,Urbana,Olney,Vandalia,Decatur, and possiblyLawrenceville. From July 1856 onwards, he gave over fifty speeches acrossIllinoisin support of thepresidential campaignofJohn C. Fremontand to rally the disparate elements of the emergingRepublican Party. See the1856 Federal Election.In hisletterto Lincoln, Julian M. Sturtevant urged Lincoln to run for theU.S. House of Representativesin  the Sixth Congressional District of Illinois in place of candidateJohn Williams. This district included bothSangamon CountyandMorgan County, home to Springfield and Jacksonville, respectively. The nascent Illinois Republican\n                  Party had considered several candidates to run for the U.S. House of Representatives\n                  against incumbentDemocratThomas L. Harrisin the district in 1856.Richard Yates, who had lost his reelection bid for the seat to Harris in the1854 election, refused to run again. Lincoln and other Republican leaders met in July 1856 with\n                  the hope of persuadinganti-NebraskaDemocratJohn M. Palmerto be their party’s candidate for the seat, but he declined.By early September, Springfield merchant Williams had been chosen to run instead,\n                  and was touted as a hardworking “honestClayWhig” who threatened to win the votes ofAmerican Partysupporters and of anti-slavery Democrats. Harris defeated him handily, garnering\n                  54  percent of the vote to Williams’ 46 percent. At the end of Williams’ life, it\n                  was claimed that he outperformed a Democratic majority of 4,000 voters in losing by\n                  only about 2,100 votes. Yates, however, had lost the seat by only 200 votes in theprevious election.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 16 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-16; 17 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-17; 19 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-19; 20 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-20; 23 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-23; 24 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-24; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:424-33;Webster's New Geographical Dictionary(Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, 1988), 563, 1149;Abraham Lincoln and Others to John M.
