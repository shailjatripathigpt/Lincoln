FremontatParis, Illinois, on August 6, 1856. No other account of this speech has been located.Lincoln intended to travel to Paris by train, arriving on August 5, 1856. Following\n                  this speech on August 6, he spoke over the next few days inGrand View,Charleston, andShelbyville,  arriving home inSpringfieldon August 10. From July 1856 onwards, Lincoln gave over fifty speeches acrossIllinoisin support of Fremont and to rally the disparate elements of the emerging Republican\n                  Party. See the1856 Federal Election.Preceding this excerpt is a description of a speech byJohn A. Matsonat the same meeting. According to a brief description of the Paris  meeting in theDaily Illinois State Journal, about one thousand people attended the event.Abraham Lincoln to Joseph Gillespie;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 7 August 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-08-07; 8 August 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-08-08; 9 August 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-08-09; 11 August 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-08-11; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:425-33;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 13 August 1856, 2:2."
