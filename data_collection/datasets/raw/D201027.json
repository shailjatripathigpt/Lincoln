The first edition included\n                  534 pages of biographical sketches of hundreds of congressmen and a 159-page appendix\n                  with information such as the meeting and adjournment of every session of Congress,\n                  the signers of the Declaration of Independence, the organization of executive departments,\n                  and governors of each state and territory since the adoption of the U.S. Constitution.Lanman’sDictionaryreceived good press reviews. TheNational Intelligencercalled it, “Convenient as a work of reference,” and theNew York Timeslabeled it, “Undoubtedly of much value to public men for reference.” However, the\n                  work did not please everyone. Describing Lanman as a “sublime specimen of Copperheadism,”\n                  theNational Republicancomplained in December 1863—undoubtedly relating to the next edition, which appeared\n                  in 1864—that Lanman was attempting to charge the government for copies of his dictionary\n                  to be printed and for a copyright. The newspaper described the work as, “about as\n                  useful and reliable as a Philadelphia Directory of ten years ago.”Charles Lanman,Dictionary of the United States Congress, Containing Biographical Sketches of its\n                        Members from the Foundation of the Government(Philadelphia: J.
