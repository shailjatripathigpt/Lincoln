Stuart wrote and signed this letter.The actual date of this letter is unknown, but on January 2, 1849, Stuart joined other\n                  prominent Illinoisans in signing apetitionendorsing William Harvey for the job of U.S. marshal.  On January 18,Ninian W. Edwards, who also signed the petition, wrote Abraham Lincoln an almost identicallettersuggesting Benjamin Bond as an alternative should Harvey fail to be appointed.  The\n                  similarity of Stuart’s and Edwards’ letters, and the absence of any other known letters\n                  regarding Harvey, lends strong credence to the assumption that Stuart wrote his letter\n                  sometime in January 1849."
