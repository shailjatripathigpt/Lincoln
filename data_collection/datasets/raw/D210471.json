Henderson’s name does not appear in the official registers of the officers\n                  and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so apparently he did not receive\n                  an appointment in the General Land Office or any other federal department.Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 128;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851), 134;Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on   the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853)."
