Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to replaceRichard M. Youngas  commissioner.  In aletterto Lincoln dated May 13, Henderson noted that Edwards had withdrawn his candidacy,\n                  and he urged Lincoln to come to Washington immediately if he wanted the position,\n                  believing that success would be assured by his presence.  As Henderson hoped, Lincoln\n                  would eventually become a candidate. Neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received\n                  the appointment, the job going to Butterfield instead. See theGeneral Land Office Affair."
