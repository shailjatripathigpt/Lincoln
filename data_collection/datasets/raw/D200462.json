        "text": "2Lincoln references the movement to draft Zachary Taylor as the Whig Party’s candidate\n                  in thepresidential election of 1848. Lincoln had been actively working to advance Taylor’s candidacy as a member of the\n                  so-called “Young Indians,” a Whig Executive Committee founded byTruman Smithin the spring of 1847 to provide the Whig Party with a unified national organization\n                  for the imminent presidential campaign.  Including principally but not exclusively\n                  Southern Whigs, the Young Indians made it their goal to nominate Zachary Taylor as\n                  the Whig Party standard bearer in 1848.  Some Whigs condemned the movement for Taylor,\n                  a southern slaveholder who had no previous political affiliation, as an abandonment\n                  of Whig principles.  Taylor’s insistence on an independent candidacy, separate from\n                  party affiliation, further eroded his following among the party faithful, includingHenry Clay, the party’s standard bearer in the1844 electionand was still the nominal head of the party.Abolitionists, peace advocates, anti-slavery reformers, Whigs, and even some Democrats\n                  opposed the Mexican War and criticized President James K. Polk for its origins and\n                  conduct.  Criticism centered inCongress, where Whigs and anti-war Democrats attacked the president.  Lincoln himself questioned\n                  the war’s origins in hisspot resolutionsof December 22, 1847, and delivered a scathing attack on Polk in aspeechmade on January 12, 1848.  Whigs hoped to capitalize on opposition to Polk’s war\n                  policy and territorial expansion in the southwest to win the presidency in 1848.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:275-76; Holman Hamilton,Zachary Taylor: Soldier in the White House(Hamden, CT: Archon, 1966), 63-64; Michael F. Holt,The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of\n                        the Civil War(New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 248-51, 255-57, 309-30, 333-39; K.

        "text": "3Taylor and the Polk administration clashed repeatedly during the war over strategy\n                  and war aims, particularly over territorial acquisition, which Taylor wished to limit,\n                  in opposition to the intentions of President Polk and many Democrats.  Polk sharply\n                  rebuked Taylor for the armistice enacted after theBattle of Monterreyand blamed Taylor for American losses  at theBattle of Buena Vista.  He also gutted Taylor’s army to outfit the expedition againstVeracruz.  Taylor came to believe his disfavor was due less to his generalship than to his\n                  growing popularity and threat as a potential presidential candidate.Elbert B.
