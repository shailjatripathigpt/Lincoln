        "text": "2Following the recommendation ofElihu B. Washburne, Washington, DC attorney and patent agent Peter H. Watson visited Lincoln in Springfield\n                  in June 1855 in regards  to the defense of  the case ofMcCormick v. Talcott et al. Cyrus H. McCormick had instituted a suit against the  Rockford firm of Manny & Company\n                  in theU.S. Circuit Courtin November 1854 for patent infringement, claiming that the mechanical reaper of\n                  John H. Manny’s design and manufacture copied several elements of McCormick’s own\n                  reaper. Manny & Co. was represented in the case by Watson, who had helped John H.\n                  Manny obtain his patents, as well as attorneysGeorge HardingandEdwin M. Stanton. Upon meeting with Lincoln, Watson hired him for the defense with a $400 retainer,\n                  as  none of Manny’s legal representatives lived inIllinoisand they apparently deemed it prudent  to include an attorney from the state as the\n                  trial was to be held in Chicago. The trial was instead moved toCincinnati, where it commenced on September 20, 1855, and while the other members of the defense\n                  team allowed Lincoln to attend, they blocked his participation in the case. McCormick’s\n                  attorneys in the case includedIsaac N. ArnoldandEdward N. Dickerson. The verdict in the case was announced on January 16, 1856 in favor of Manny & Co.,\n                  after which McCormick appealed the decision to theU.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court’s ruling.Elihu B.
