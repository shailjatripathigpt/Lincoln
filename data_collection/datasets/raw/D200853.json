        "text": "4Lincoln served as co-attorney with Orville H. Browning representing defendant William\n                  A. Hall in the case ofPapin v. Hallin the U.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois. In December 1854, Joseph\n                  L. Papin sued Hall for ejectment from a ten-acre lot near the old town ofPeoria. The land was part of the contested French  claims in Peoria. French immigrants settled\n                  inIllinoisearly in its history.   During theWar of 1812, American forces burned Peoria and displaced its French settlers.  In 1820 and again\n                  in 1823,Congressoffered the French settlers claims to their former property.  The land at the time\n                  had very little value, and many immigrants had moved away and did not accept the offer.\n                  However, land prices eventually increased, and by the 1830s and 1840s, surveyors made\n                  plats based on the French claims, resulting in disputes between original settlers\n                  and the current owners.  Hall settled the land in question in 1834, residing on it\n                  at the time of the case.  In July 1858, a jury decided for Papin.  Hall appealed the\n                  judgment to theU. S. Supreme Court.  In December 1860, the Supreme Court  reversed the judgment of the circuit court.\n                  JusticeJames M. Wayneruled that the 1823 French claim act applied only to the new village of Peoria and\n                  that the land in question was an outlying lot in the old village of Peoria, one and\n                  a half miles away.  Wayne also argued that Papin's claim to the land derived from\n                  one Francis Willette, who would have had French claim confirmations exceeding the\n                  statutory limit of ten acres.Newspaper Report, Document ID: 132934;  Newspaper Report, Document ID: 132935,Papin v.
