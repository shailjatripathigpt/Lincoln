        "text": "3On June 4, theChicago Tribunepublished a letter under the headline “Opposition to Lovejoy” and dated June 1 from\n                  Bloomington. The author,  “Fair Play,” accused Davis of leading a movement to defeat\n                  the renomination of Owen Lovejoy to represent the Third Illinois Congressional District\n                  in theU.S. House of Representatives. The author wrote, “Judge D. is a very fair man in his way, but has no more sympathy\n                  with the vitalizing principle of the Republican party than an Egyptian mummy.” “Fair\n                  Play” also accused Davis of aspiring toward the seat occupied by Lovejoy.  Lincoln\n                  responded with an anonymousletterto the newspaper refuting the accusation and expressing his friendship to and knowledge\n                  of Davis.Neither Davis nor Lincoln had initially been supportive of abolitionist Lovejoy in\n                  the1856 Federal Election, when Lovejoy was first elected to the House. Lincolnwroteto Davis on July 7, 1856, “When I heard that Swett was beaten, and Lovejoy nominated,\n                  it turned me blind;” but due to the people’s support of Lovejoy, Lincoln concluded,\n                  “I really think it best to let the matter stand.” Likewise, Davis did not support\n                  Lovejoy for his reelection.  Conservative Republicans, disgruntled with Lovejoy’sabolitionismand fearful of its impact on Republican candidates in state elections, planned to\n                  block Lovejoy's renomination at the district congressional convention.  Some of Lincoln’s\n                  friends—including Davis,T. Lyle Dickey,Ward H. Lamon, andLeonard Swett—supported this scheme, believing that Lincoln, who was the leading Republican candidate\n                  to unseatStephen A. Douglasas U.S. senator in the upcoming1858 Federal Election, could only succeed if Lovejoy was not re-nominated. Once hope of preventing Lovejoy's\n                  renomination vanished, Lamon and others pondered finding a independent candidate to\n                  challenge Lovejoy.  Lamon sought Lincoln's opinion, but the latter urged against it,\n                  arguing the fissure of the Republican Party into Lovejoy and anti-Lovejoy factions\n                  would likely result in aDemocraticvictory and hurt his chance of being elected to theU.S. Senate.Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 4 June 1858, 2:3; Howard W.

In 1845, theIllinois General Assemblyenacted legislation  related to the funding and completion of the canal. Section\n                  five of the act stipulates that “The preliminary expenses of the negotiation of said\n                  contract with the expenses of the examinations of the canal property by the agents\n                  appointed by the authority of the bond-holders shall be first paid by the said trustees\n                  unless some other provision for their payment be made by the General Assembly.”New YorkbankerDavid Leavittmaintained that he was owed a commission of $40,000 for work he claimed to have done\n                  to help secure a loan of $1,600,000 for the canal. In his capacity as a member of\n                  theBoard of Trustees of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, Ray had introduced a resolution in October of 1857 authorizing payment of this sum,\n                  which Leavitt, also a trustee, had signed. Leavitt and Ray argued that their signatures\n                  on the resolution constituted the approval of a majority of the three-person Board\n                  of Trustees, and Leavitt, the board treasurer, charged the $40,000 to his treasurer’s\n                  report for 1857. The remaining member of the Board of Trustees,William H. Swift, protested, and the canal’s bondholders inEngland, directed their agent in the United States to file suit in the Massachusetts Supreme\n                  Judicial Court to recover the money from Leavitt. Leavitt was ultimately allowed $10,000\n                  of the sum he had claimed, and was ordered in 1863 to repay $32,063.90 plus court\n                  costs.“An Act Supplemental to ‘An Act to Provide for the Completion of the Illinois and\n                     Michigan Canal, and for the Payment of the Canal Debt,’ Approved, February 21st, One\n                     Thousand Eight Hundred and Forty-Three,” 1 March 1845,Laws of Illinois(1845),      31-32;The New-York Times(New York), 31 December 1879, 5:6; Illinois HouseJournal. 1863. 23rd G.
