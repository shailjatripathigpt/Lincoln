Douglas representing\n                  the district in theU.S. House of Representativesin the Twenty-Eighth, Twenty-Ninth, and Thirtieth Congresses. After Douglas won election\n                  to theU.S. Senatein 1847, Democrat William A. Richardson filled this congressional seat.

In December 1854, Jonas\n                  wrote Lincoln anotherletterabout the election.Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into the congressional\n                  election campaign in the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches\n                  against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates such as Williams.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first).  As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats.The race between Richardson and Williams was close, but not as close as Jonas predicted.\n                  Richardson won 52.4 percent of the district’s votes to Williams’ 47.6 percent. In\n                  Pike County, the Williams emerged with 50.1 percent of the vote to Richardson’s 49.9\n                  percent. In Brown County, Richardson carried 60.9 percent of the vote to Williams’\n                  39.1 percent.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, in late-November 1854,\n                  declined to serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, he  did not win\n                  election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska\n                  DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
