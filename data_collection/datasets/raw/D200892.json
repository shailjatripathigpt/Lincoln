In his June 15 letter to Lincoln, Trumbull stated that he agreed McLean was the party’s best option for\n                  a presidential candidate and that Lincoln’s June 7 letter convinced him to attend\n                  theRepublican National Conventionto help ensure that a conservative candidate such as McLean was nominated. At the\n                  convention, however, the party’s delegates nominated John C. Fremont as the party’s\n                  candidate for president.

Webb were each scheduled to\n                  speak at the Democratic Party’s June 26 ratification meeting. Like Constable and Hogan,\n                  Linder, James W.

In\n                  a June 7letterto Trumbull, Lincoln referred to Constable, Singleton, and Morrison as men who had\n                  converted to the Democratic Party “hook and line.” TheDaily Illinois State Journalcalled Constable, Hogan, and Webb (the latter of whom it referred to as “Bob Webb”)\n                  “rotten Whigs,” and criticized Linder, Webb, and Morrison for “throwing doubt and\n                  distrust” upon the membership of the fledgling Republican Party.In its coverage of the event, theDaily Illinois State Registermade no mention of Linder, Morrison, or Webb delivering addresses, nor of Singleton\n                  attending the event. TheDaily Illinois State Journalreported that Webb attended, but also made no mention of him speaking.
