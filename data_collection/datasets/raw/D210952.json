        "text": "2Judd may be referring to Lincoln’s and Trumbull’s speaking schedules during the political\n                  campaign of 1858.  Lincoln was the Republican candidate from Illinois for theU.S. Senatein 1858, hoping to unseatStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. Trumbull, a sitting Republican senator from Illinois\n                  and former antislavery Democrat, also delivered public speeches in support of Lincoln’s\n                  campaign. Trumbull returned to Illinois from serving in the U.S. Senate on August\n                  6, 1585, and delivered his first speech of the campaign on August 7 inChicago.  Republican officials arranged an itinerary for Trumbull to stump the state.Lincoln’s reply to Judd’s request for a list of appointments, if he wrote one, has\n                  not been located.  In addition to their individual campaign events, Lincoln and Douglas\n                  agreed to aseries of debatesin seven of the nine congressional districts in Illinois.  Once Lincoln and Douglas\n                  agreed on the dates of the debates, Republican newspapers inSpringfieldand Chicago published these dates and Lincoln’s list of speaking engagements.  TheDaily Illinois State Journalin Springfield first published Lincoln’s schedule on August 6; theChicago Daily Press and Tribunefollowed suit on August 9.  TheDaily Illinois State Journalfirst published Trumbull’s list of appointments on September 2; theChicago Daily Press and Tribunedid likewise on September 6, publishing Trumbull’s engagements alongside the appointments\n                  ofOwen Lovejoy, Republican candidate for theU.S. House of Representativesin the Illinois Fourth Congressional District.

        "text": "3As chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Territories, Douglas introduced theKansas-Nebraska Actin 1854. The bill effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820. In 1856,\n                  Senator Trumbull won approval among Illinois Republicans for denouncing the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and the popular sovereignty principles upon which it was based. His debates with\n                  Douglas  in the Senate later helped inform some of Lincoln’s arguments against Douglas\n                  in 1858.Lincoln and Douglas agreed that Douglas would open atOttawa(August 21),Jonesboro(September 15),Galesburg(October 7), andAlton(October 15); Lincoln would open atFreeport(August 27),Charleston(September 18), andQuincy(October 15).  The next debate where Lincoln opened after the publication of Trumbull’s\n                  schedule would have been at Charleston on September 18.  Lincoln commenced the debate\n                  at Charleston with a brief defense of his position on racial equality, followed by\n                  a repetition of Trumbull’s charge, made in his speech on August 7,  that Douglas had\n                  altered a bill in the U.S. Senate byRobert A. Toombsin such a manner as to deny popular sovereignty to the people of theKansas Territoryas they sought statehood.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly, and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular\n                  through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition\n                  as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Graham A.
