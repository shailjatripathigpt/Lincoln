        "text": "2Lincoln was interested in the outcome of the elections in Madison County because he\n                  was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to, DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal ElectionLincoln's statements proved prophetic.DemocratSamuel A. Buckmasterfrom Madison County beat Gillespie by 184 votes in 1858 to earn an Illinois Senate\n                  seat for District Twenty-One, which included Bond, Madison, and Montgomery counties.\n                  The men elected to theHouse of Representativesin Madison County—Zephaniah B. Job(over Republican Isaac Cox) andJoseph H. Sloss(over RepublicanCurtis Blakeman) — both voted for Douglas forU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Election, as did Buckmaster.Louis L.

        "text": "3Former members of theAmerican Party, often referred to colloquially as \"Fillmore Men\" because the national party backed\n                  Millard Fillmore in thepresidential election of 1856, were an important source of votes for both Democrats and Republicans in the state\n                  and federal elections of 1858, and both sides worked to garner their support.Lincoln's tabulation of the votes in the presidential election of 1856 in Bond, Madison,\n                  and Montgomery counties is accurate with the exception of John C. Fremont's tally\n                  in Montgomery County; modern tabulations have Fremont receiving 167 votes.Tyler Anbinder,Nativism & Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings & the Politics of the 1850s(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), 246-78; Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard,\n                     “Stephen A.

        "text": "4Joseph Gillespierespondedto Lincoln's concern about Douglas's support by telling him thatHenry W. Billingsand Zephaniah B. Job were largely correct and that at least half of the American\n                  Party votes in Illinois Senate District Twenty-One  would go to Douglas.Douglas and the Democrats proved more adept than the Republicans in attracting the\n                  votes of former members of the American Party.  By way of illustration, of the fourteen\n                  counties where the American vote had an impact on the election for state representatives,\n                  Democrats carried eleven of the fourteen.  One of these counties was Madison, which\n                  sent two Americans to the Illinois House in 1856, but shifted to the Democrats in\n                  1858.In addition to the Buckmaster, Job,  and Sloss, the House representatives from Bond\n                  County,Charles Hoiles, and Montgomery County,James M. Davis, voted for Douglas. Overall, Douglas won the election with fifty-one votes over Lincoln's\n                  forty-six votes. Despite the loss, Lincoln achieved a national prominence that was\n                  essential for his campaign for the presidency in1860.Louis L.
