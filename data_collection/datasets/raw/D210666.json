        "text": "3At the time of this letter, Abraham Lincoln was theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for the U.S. Senate. He was running againstDemocraticincumbent Stephen A. Douglas. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.  For the first part of theelection campaign of 1858, Lincoln had often followed Douglas on the trail, delivering speeches either later\n                  in the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. Douglas eventually agreed\n                  to a series of debates with Lincoln, which became the famousLincoln-Douglas Debates. The first of these debates was held in Ottawa, Illinois,  on August 21. Republicans\n                  both within Illinois and outside Illinois praised Lincoln’s performance in the Ottawa\n                  debate, although some thought he needed to attack Douglas more rather than just defend\n                  his and the Republican Party’s positions.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 482-85, 495-96; Allen\n                     C.

Trumbull delivered a public address in Alton, Illinois,\n                  on August 25. Francis P. Blair, Jr. attended this rally and also delivered a speech.\n                  Blair, who was a Democrat but against theLecompton Constitution, had, in the summer of 1858, publicly voiced his support for Lincoln to replace Douglas\n                  as Illinois’s U.S. senator.Public attention was focused on Blair and B. Gratz Brown at the time due to a third\n                  party publicizing the content of a letter Blair wrote Brown in the winter of 1857.\n                  In the letter, Blair discussed a meeting with Douglas during which Douglas declared\n                  his intention to join the Republican Party in 1860. Although he later denied it, following\n                  his split with PresidentJames Buchananover the Lecompton Constitution, Douglas courted political support for his senatorial\n                  reelection campaign among members of the Republican Party, at times even intimating\n                  that he was finished with the Democratic Party.Allen C.

Copies of the speech\n                  do not appear to be extant. However, in aletterto Lincoln,John Triblewrote that, in the speech, Douglas  compared members of the American Party to “army\n                  worms” and that “a great many were sorely offended” by the comparison. Former members\n                  of the American Party were an important source of votes for both Democrats and Republicans\n                  in the state andfederal elections of 1858, and both parties  worked throughout the campaign season to garner their support.In the end, in Illinois’s local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Lyman Trumbull to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Lyman Trumbull;Lyman Trumbull to Abraham Lincoln;Lyman Trumbull to Abraham Lincoln; Lyman Trumbull to Abraham Lincoln; Abraham Lincoln to Lyman Trumbull; Lyman Trumbull to Abraham Lincoln;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 19 August 1858, 4:1; Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.
