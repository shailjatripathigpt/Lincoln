In this instance, the official wasIllinoisSecretary of StateOzias M. Hatch, who was being sued in theIllinois Supreme Courtfor a writ of mandamus to furnish state printers Lanphier & Walker of theDemocraticIllinois State Registerwith a true copy of an 1857 bill apportioning representation in theIllinois General Assembly. The bill had been drafted and supported by the Democrats with an eye towards maintaining\n                  their party’s majority in the General Assembly. TheIllinois House of Representativespassed the bill on February 16, 1857, and theIllinois Senateconcurred on February 18.RepublicanGovernorWilliam H. Bissellmistakenly signed the bill then cancelled his signature after his secretary had already\n                  reported his approval to the House. John A. McClernand was one of the Democratic attorneys\n                  representing the plaintiffs, while Hatch retained Lincoln,Orville H. Browning, andJackson Grimshaw. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in Hatch’s favor in February 1858 and denied the\n                  writ.In addition to this letter, LincolntelegraphedGeorge T. BrowninAltonon this same day telling him to send Joseph Gillespie to Springfield immediately.\n                  Lincolnwrotea similar letter on this date toGustave P. Koernerrequesting his consultation on the case. Neither Gillespie nor Koerner was an attorney\n                  of record on the case.“Mandamus,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
