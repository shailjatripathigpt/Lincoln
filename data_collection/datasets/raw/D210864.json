In the1858 Federal Election, Lincoln was running against Democratic incumbent Douglas as the Illinois Republican\n                  Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. Both men  canvassed thestatethroughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, so  the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the state’s race for the U.S. Senate seat.\n                  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 9 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-09; 10 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-10; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

Sandford. Lincoln reminded his audience that Douglas had previously praised Democratic President\n                  Andrew Jackson for defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the 1819 caseMcCulloch v. Maryland, when the court declared that theU.S. Congresshad the power to create a national bank.Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:470."

        "text": "4Seymour is referring to the U.S. Supreme Court decision inWorcester v. Georgia, which the court rendered in 1832—during Jackson’s tenure as president—and which\n                  Jackson also famously defied. In the case, the court upheld the sovereignty of tribal\n                  nations, recognizing that they possessed the same broad inherent powers as other nations\n                  and therefore had significant independence from state law. Jackson disagreed with\n                  the court’s ruling and did nothing to induce the state of Georgia to yield to the\n                  court’s decision and submit to law, even as Georgia’s defiance of the ruling nearly\n                  caused a crisis between federal and state authorities.There is no evidence that Lincoln adopted Seymour’s suggestion to include Jackson’s\n                  disdain forWorcester v. Georgiain either his 1858 political speeches or in his debates with Douglas. See theLincoln-Douglas Debates.Harold A.

        "text": "5In the1856 Federal Election, Pennsylvania’s voters had awarded Democratic presidential candidateJames Buchanana majority of their votes and sent Democrat William Bigler as well as RepublicanSimon Cameronto the U.S. Senate. Although both Bigler and Cameron served in the U.S. Senate until\n                  March 1861, the state elections of 1858 marked a turning point in politics for Pennsylvania.\n                  In 1856, 50.1 percent of Pennsylvania’s state offices went to Democratic candidates;\n                  in 1858, that number fell to just 46.3 percent. In 1856, Democrats held fifteen seats\n                  and Republicans ten in the Pennsylvania congressional delegation; in 1858, Republicans\n                  held twenty seats and Democrats five.  This shift was sufficient to break the Democratic\n                  Party’s hold on the state, which in turn decreased the party’s share of electoral\n                  college votes and national influence.Ultimately, in Illinois’ local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Yanek Mieczkowski,The Routledge Historical Atlas of Presidential Elections(New York and London: Routledge, 2001), 50;Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1996(Alexandria, VA: CQ Staff Directories, 1997), 661, 771; Bruce Collins, “The Democrats’\n                     Loss of Pennsylvania in 1858,”The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography109 (October 1985), 499-500; John L.
