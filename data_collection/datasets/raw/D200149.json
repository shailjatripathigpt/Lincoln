Atticus’s owners pursued him, eventually capturing  him in Maine and returning\n                  him to Georgia. They  later charged the ship’s captain and first mate with “felonious\n                  abduction of human property.” Two successive governors of Maine refused, for various\n                  reasons, to extradite the captain and mate, which spurred the legislatures of the\n                  states into a years-long quarrel that eventually made its way to Congress.Niles' National Register(Philadelphia, PA), 2 February 1839, 2:2; Stanley Harrold,Border War: Fighting over Slavery before the Civil War(Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010), 77.On December 12, 1838, Governor Thomas Carlin presented to the Illinois House of Representatives\n                  resolutions from the legislatures of Georgia and Alabama relating to the Governor\n                  of Maine’s refusal to surrender Daniel Philbrook and  Edward Kelleram as fugitives\n                  from justice. The House referred the resolutions to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n                  On January 5, the Committee reported back.Illinois HouseJournal.  1838. 11th G. A., 1st sess., 62, 170-71."
