In a\n                  December 8letterto Lincoln, Davis wrote that Swett thought he could go toJoliet, Illinoisthe following Monday or Tuesday—December 11 or 12, respectively.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. He\n                  likely wrote Davis such a letter, although no correspondence between Lincoln and Davis\n                  in the whole of 1854 prior to Davis’ December 8letterto Lincoln has been located.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

According to these letters, the only two assemblymen\n                  Swett met with personally wereJohn Strunkand JudgeGavion D. A. Parks, both of whom Swett believed would vote for Lincoln for U.S. Senator.The Nineteenth General Assembly convened at Springfield on January 1, 1855. Voting\n                  for the state’s representative in the U.S. Senate took place on February 8.  Ultimately,\n                  Lincoln  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected\n                  anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Both Strunk and Parks cast their votes for Lincoln for six ballots, then\n                  Strunk switched his vote toJoel A. Matteson.  Parks switched his vote to Trumbull on the eighth ballot. See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.Leonard Swett to Abraham Lincoln;Leonard Swett to Abraham Lincoln; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:401-2;Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 2 January 1855, 2:1; 9 February 1855, 2:1; Louis L.
