I was in both seiges atFort Meigs, also at thebattle of the Thames, where we captured the British army, and in many other difficulties with the Indians.\n               And I seriously believe that there was not a man in the United States as well qualified\n               to be our Commander-in-Chief asWm. H. Harrison.  I further state on my honor, that I never saw the first evidence of cowardice in\n               Gen. Harrison, nor do I believe any other man e[ve]r did, if he will speak the[t]ruth of  th[?] hero. Gen. Harrison was born to fill civil offices also;  and he has had many, and has filled\n               them with advantage to the country and honor to himself;  and I trust I shall see\n               him in the Presidential chair, performing the duties of that high office, as did the\n               GreatWashington.  Now, success to thehero of Tippecanoe, Fort Meigs and the Thames, and the Guardian of the whole Western Country! I hope Gen. Harrison will perform the duties of President and settle our national\n               affairs, both at home and abroad, as well as he performed the duties of Commander-in-Chief\n               of the North-Western Army; and if he does, no man will dare complain, and the tree\n               of liberty, which has been dying for years past, will blossom again, and bear abundance\n               of good and ripe fruit, for the use of all good meaning men and their posterity. I received four wounds while serving under Gen. Harrison, and which have so disabled\n               me that I could not get toSpringfieldon the 14th of his month, to meet my old companions in arms.1",
