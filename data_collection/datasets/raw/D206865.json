        "text": "3The case in question,United States vs. City of Chicago, concerned part of Fort Dearborn, an abandoned federal property, claimed by the city for the purpose of opening Michigan\n                  Avenue and other roads to the north of Madison Avenue.  The city passed an ordinance\n                  to remove the obstructions in the fort to extend the streets.  Viewing Fort Dearborn\n                  as federal property, the United States filed for an injunction to prevent the city\n                  from destroying federal property.   The city claimed that the Secretary of War had\n                  laid out an addition, called the Fort Dearborn Addition to Chicago, and that the city\n                  was simply carrying out those plans.  The district judge granted the injunction, and\n                  upon the hearing for a continuance, the district and circuit judges differed in opinion.\n                  The court certified three questions to theU. S. Supreme Courtto determine, in effect, whether Chicago had the right to open city streets through\n                  federal property. Lincoln monitored the case in the Supreme Court for Scammon but\n                  did not argue the case before the Court.  The circuit court finally dismissed the\n                  case in 1870.For more on this case, search “United States v. Chicago, Illinois,” Martha L. Benner\n                     and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition, 2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),http://www.lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org;  Roy P.
