        "text": "2John M. Clayton’s August 10, 1849 letter to Lincoln has not been located. However,\n                  PresidentZachary TaylorappointedLincoln secretary of the Territory of Oregon August 9, 1849. Lincoln received this\n                  appointment less than a month after Taylor appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront to theIllinoisWhigs who had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated and elected president. Many\n                  Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized both\n                  President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln the position of  secretary of\n                  the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7."

        "text": "3Lincoln wrote Clayton several more times on this topic. In oneletterin September 1849, he indicates Clayton somehow did not receive this letter declining\n                  the position. Other Whigs in Springfield and the surrounding area alsowroteClayton to recommend Simeon Francis for the position in Lincoln’s stead. In the end,\n                  Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory.On September 20, 1849, in a final effort to ease any tensions caused by Butterfield’s\n                  appointment, the Taylor administration also offered Lincoln appointment as governor\n                  of the Oregon Territory. After serious consideration of this offer, Lincoln also turned\n                  this position down, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Francis’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did\n                  not receive any other appointment during this period. The 1861 official register shows\n                  Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Abraham Lincoln to John M. Clayton;Abraham Lincoln to John M.
