        "text": "4In February 1831, theGeneral Assemblydivided thestateinto three congressional districts.  Sangamon,Greene,Morgan, andTazewell, along with eighteen other countries, composed the third district, which John T.\n                  Stuart represented inCongressfrom 1839 to 1843.John Reynoldsrepresented the first district which, when first created, included sixteen counties.\n                  Legislation in 1837 and 1839 creating the counties ofCass,Jersey,Scott,Logan, andMenardrequired voters in those areas to vote with the counties from which they had been\n                  drawn until the next state apportionment, effectively placing them in the third congressional\n                  district. In March 1843, the General Assembly further expanded the district system\n                  by dividing the state into seven congressional districts.  Jersey and Greene became\n                  part of the fifth district, and Cass, Logan, Menard, Morgan, Sangamon, Scott, and\n                  Tazewell part of the seventh.  As Lincoln indicated, someDemocratsopposed the district system, believing that at large voting would strengthen party\n                  discipline and unity.  The new district system did not hurt the Democrats in the1842 congressional election, as they won six of the seven seats. Sangamon County and the seventh district remained\n                  aWhigstronghold, withJohn J. Hardinsucceeding Stuart.“An Act to Lay Out the State into Districts, for the Purpose of Electing Representatives\n                     to the Congress of the United States,” 15 February 1831,Revised Laws of Illinois(1833), 235;An Act to Create and Establish the County of Jersey;An Act to Create and Organize the County of Scott;An Act for the Formation of the County of Cass;An Act to Establish the Counties of Menard, Logan, and Dane; “An Act to Establish Seven Congressional Districts,” 1 March 1843,Laws of Illinois(1843), 71-72; Theodore Calvin Pease,The Frontier State, 1818-1848, vol. 2 ofSesquicentennial History of Illinois(Springfield: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1918), 293; Theodore C.
