Just a few days after this\n                  letter, however, Horace White of theChicago Journalalso wrote Lincoln aletterencouraging him to come speak at Chicago and providing additional context for Wilson’s\n                  invitation.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into opposing the\n                  act, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the legislation and to rebut Stephen A. Douglas’ views\n                  on popular sovereignty. He even traveled in Douglas’ wake for a time in both September\n                  and October 1854, as much as his legal work permitted, giving lengthy speeches in\n                  reply to Douglas. Lincoln also spoke in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates running for theU.S. House of Representativesin thecongressional election of 1854. Lincoln delivered aspeechin Chicago against the Kansas-Nebraska Act on October 27, 1854, which theChicago Journalcovered in positive terms.In Illinois’ Second Congressional District, which included Chicago and other parts\n                  of Northern Illinois,James H. Woodworth, aFree-SoilDemocrat running as aRepublican, won the seat, defeatingDemocratJohn B. Turner, WhigRobert S. Blackwell, and anti-Nebraska DemocratEdward L. Mayowith 53.1 percent of the vote. This represented, as Wilson predicted, a shift from\n                  theelection of 1852, in which DemocratJohn Wentworthwon the Second Congressional District with 46.7 percent of the total vote, compared\n                  to WhigCyrus Aldrich’s 39.9 percent and Free Soil candidateJames H. Collins’ 13.3 percent. In the state as a whole in 1854, Republicans won 52 percent of the\n                  vote compared to Democratic candidates’ 43 percent.Lincoln allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly, albeit unwillingly at first, but as the election campaign reached its climax, his\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, in late-November 1854,\n                  declined to serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, he  did not win\n                  election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska\n                  DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
