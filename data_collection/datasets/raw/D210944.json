His visit attracted no more than\n                  twelve hundred attendees, approximately four hundred of whom were  proslavery Missourians.\n                  One newspaper reported that his topic only repeated recently published speeches and\n                  his oratorical effort, though an able one, was inferior to his abilities.Lincoln was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Voters inSt. Clair County, home to Belleville which constituted Illinois House of Representatives District\n                  Twelve, reelected RepublicanVital Jarrotin 1858, and elected RepublicanJohn Scheel, who replaced outgoing DemocratWilliam W. Roman. In the election of 1858,William H. Underwoodheld over as the member of the Illinois Senate representing St. Clair andMonroecounties. Although Underwood joined ranks with the Republican Party later in life,\n                  at the time he was elected to this Illinois Senate seat in 1856, he was a Democrat.The Ottawa Free Trader(IL), 4 September 1858, 2:1;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 14 September 1858, 2:4; 5 November 1858, 1:3; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-85, 557; Allen C.
