        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote the text of this bill as well as the bill’s title on page two.\n                  The title and the enacting clause have been torn off the document.Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, dated “An Act concerning Public Revenue,\" February 1837, but evidence clearing show\n                  that theactbecame law in February 1839.On January 2, 1840, Lincoln introduced this as an individual bill entitled “A Bill\n                  for an Act Exempting Revolutionary Pensioners from Taxation on Loan Money” immediately\n                  afterPeter Greenintroduced abillentitled “A Bill to Amend ‘An Act concerning the Public Revenue,’ Approved February\n                  26, 1839.”  \n                  Lincoln moved his bill as an amendment adding an additional section to Green’s bill.\n                  The House adopted, and referred the bill as amended to the Committee on Finance, of\n                  which Lincoln was a member.  Both the House and Senate  eventually passed Green’s\n                  bill, and theactbecame law without Lincoln’s amendment concerning Revolutionary pensioners.Illinois HouseJournal. 1839. 11th G.
