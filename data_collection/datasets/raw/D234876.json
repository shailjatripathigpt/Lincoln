Hay gave Lincoln a promissory note\n                  for $200 at six percent interest for the first six months and ten percent thereafter.\n                  Over a period of six years, Hay repaid Lincoln with small amounts of cash and in-kind\n                  services. Hay also paid Lincoln for legal fees in a number of cases in which Lincoln\n                  was his attorney. On this date, Lincoln and Hay settled the debt. Hay gave Lincoln\n                  this promissory note and adue-billfor the balance of interest due. Hay died intestate on February 4, 1856, and his\n                  brother,Milton Hay, and brother-in-law,Joshua F. Amos, were appointed administrators for his estate.
