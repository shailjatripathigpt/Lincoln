Evans, James Harlan, and Elijah Harlan for\n                  failing to honor two promissory notes. Evans refuted that the notes had been for land\n                  and because Gingrich delivered a bad title, he refused to pay. Lincoln served as Gingrich’s\n                  attorney and required Connelly’s signature as register of theSpringfield Land Office. He planned to present the certificate to the court next term. Spanning two and a\n                  half years, the case resolved with the court ruling in favor of Gingrich.Recorder's Certificate, Document ID: 1820; Plat Map, Document ID: 1818,Gingrich v.
