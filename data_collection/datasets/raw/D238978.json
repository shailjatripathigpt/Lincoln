Although he was running againstStephen A. Douglasas theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate, at the time, the northern counties of Illinois—such as Winnebago—were a Republican\n                  stronghold. Between September 22 and 24, he delivered campaign speeches inDanville, IllinoisandUrbana, Illinoisinstead. Both he and Douglas focused their 1858 campaigns on central Illinois.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-DouglasDemocratsretained control of theIllinois General Assembly. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in the U.S. Senate and, in the1858 Federal Election, Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through\n                  his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, September,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=9; Allen C.
