        "text": "2Attorney Tevis Greathouse founded theFayette Observerin 1855. Under Greathouse's leadership, the paper leaned strongly Democratic. In\n                  January 1858, theObserversupported rejecting the pro-slaveryLecompton Constitutionuntil it could be voted upon byKansascitizens. This stance followed that ofStephen A. Douglas, who opposedJames Buchanan’s support of that constitution, leading to a split in theDemocratic Partyinto pro-Buchanan and pro-Douglas factions.  In the next month, February 1858, there\n                  was a brief break in Greathouse’s tenure when the paper was purchased by  James Parker\n                  and N. C. Davis. However, it soon returned to the ownership of Greathouse.

        "text": "4There is no evidence that Lincoln responded to this letter.Lincoln was the Republican Party nominee forU.S. Senatein 1858, challenging Douglas, the incumbent.   In the summer and fall of 1858, Lincoln\n                  crisscrossedIllinoisdelivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhig Partystronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Republicans were eager to garner support in central and southern Illinois, but the\n                  vast majority of the counties south ofSangamon, includingFayette, home to Vandalia, were solidly Democratic.  Douglas used the area’s hostility towardabolitionismto his benefit in his speeches, particularly during theLincoln-Douglas Debates. As the pair traveled through central and southern Illinois, Douglas accused Lincoln\n                  of supporting a doctrine of racial equality. He continued by asserting the superiority\n                  of the white race and the dominance of white men’s rights above all else.  Democratic\n                  newspapers echoed Douglas’s sentiments.Douglas's tactics had the desired effect in Fayette County: Fayette County voters\n                  gaveJames C. Robinson, the Democratic candidate for theU.S. House of Representativesin their congressional district, 58.2 percent of the vote in his successful bid to\n                  win election toCongress, and sent Democrats Stephen Hardin andMortimer O'Keanto Illinois House and Illinois Senate, respectively.  Hardin and O'Kean both voted\n                  for Douglas in the election for U.S. senator, allowing him to defeat Lincoln, but\n                  Lincoln, in defeat,  was catapulted to national prominence.1858 Federal Election;Lincoln-Douglas Debates.Webster's New Geographical Dictionary(Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, 1988), 1284; Allen C.
