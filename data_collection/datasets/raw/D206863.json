The docketing on the back of the letter suggests that the papers concerned\n                  James Milton, deceased, and Thomas Leakley, Company F, 2nd Illinois Volunteers, whose\n                  back pay from their service in theMexican Warwas being sought by William Milton, James Milton’s  father, through Lincoln and the\n                  firm of Hempstead & Washburne.  In aletterdated March 22, 1849,Elihu B. Washburnesuggested that Lincoln might have received a land warrant for William Milton due\n                  for his son’s service.  Public land sales records show that Milton received 240 acres\n                  by warrant in February and April 1848 in Apple River Township in northernJo Daviess County.Roy P.
