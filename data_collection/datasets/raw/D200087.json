One of the amendments was to fill the blank with Marshall. Mr.Nowlinmoved to amend the amendment by striking out Marshall and inserting Van Buren; so\n               that the new county should be called Van Buren. Mr.Douglasssaid, the name of Marshal and Van Buren were both mentioned before the committee;\n               and he thought there must have been some misunderstanding on the part of the committee\n               about the name. The question  was then taken on the amendment to the amendment, inserting Van Buren\n               instead of Marshall, and carried in the affirmative.—Ayes 52. The various amendments reported by the committee, were then agreed to. Mr.Dawsonmoved to amend the bill by striking out a part of the first section, and inserting\n               as follows: “Line dividing ranges five and six, thence south along the range line between five\n               and six, to the south west corner of township No. 18 north, of range five west, thence\n               diagonally across ranges six and seven.” Mr. Adams said, he was opposed to making any change in the boundaries as presented\n               by the bill. Mr. Dawson said that the House would bear in mind that the petition upon which this\n               bill was founded had come from the two counties ofMorganandSangamo, although the most of the petitioners we[r]e from the latter county.  The bill proposes to cut off a part of the county of Sangamo\n               only, when the petition calls for a part of Morgan also.  He believed the petition\n               had been altogether laid aside in the committee, they had acted as without any petition;\n               hence the question ought to be presented to the people anew. Mr. Lincoln said, that as a member of the committee, he would state that the bill\n               before the House was a matter of compromise.  He was willing to take the bill, because\n               before any division of Sangamo could take place, the bill declared that the people\n               of Sangamo should themselves so decide.  He would sustain the bill as it stood, the\n               new county would be too small if lessened.  He was opposed to offering to the people\n               a territory too small for their acceptance. Mr.Stonesaid, that as various alterations had been made in it since the petition was received,\n               and desiring time to examine, he would move that the House adjourn. The motion prevailed, and the House adjourned.",
