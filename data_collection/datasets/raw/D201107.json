        "text": "2Martin P. Sweet had run as aWhigcandidate for theU.S. House of RepresentativesinIllinois’ Sixth Congressional District againstDemocratThompson Campbell in theelection of 1850. Campbell won the race, garnering 50.7 percent of the vote, while Sweet earned 48.7\n                  percent. During the 1850 campaign, Campbell had been questioned on his positions on\n                  slavery, and Lincoln read the questions that had been posed to Campbell along with\n                  Campbell’s responses at theLincoln-Douglas DebateinJonesboroon September 15, 1858 as evidence of antislavery opinions held by allies ofStephen A. Douglas.In his responses in 1850, Campbell had pledged that he would support bills prohibiting\n                  slavery in U.S. territories and in theDistrict of Columbia, stated that he would oppose the admission of any slave states formed out ofTexasor any U.S. territories, committed to voting for the repeal of theFugitive Slave Act, promised to vote for a speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives who would organize\n                  the committees of that body “so as to give the Free States their just influence in\n                  the business of the legislation”, and asserted his belief that the U.S. Constitution\n                  conferred on theU.S. Congressthe power to regulate slavery, and that the protection of human rights demanded the\n                  use of any constitutional means possible to prevent trafficking in enslaved people.Howard W.

        "text": "3During the Lincoln-Douglas Debate at Jonesboro, Lincoln ended his discussion of Campbell’s\n                  antislavery stances during the latter’s 1850 electoral race against Sweet by pointing\n                  out that both men had recently appeared at the Lincoln-Douglas Debate inFreeporton August 27, with Campbell present to support Douglas and Sweet to back Lincoln.\n                  As reported in theRepublican-leaningChicago Tribune, Lincoln stated that “when Judge Douglas and myself spoke at Freeport in joint discussion,\n                  there was his same friend Campbell, come all the way fromCalifornia, to help the Judge beat me; and there was poor Martin P. Sweet standing on the platform,\n                  trying to help poor me to be elected.” In reporting this portion of Lincoln’s Jonesboro debate speech theChicago Times, a Democratic organ, omitted the descriptor “poor” for both Sweet and Lincoln. According\n                  to that newspaper, Lincoln used the phrase “sneaking about” rather than “standing\n                  on the platform” to describe Sweet’s support of Lincoln. As described byThe Daily Chicago Times, Lincoln immediately stated “I take back that ugly word” and told reporters “you\n                  must not put that in”, apparently referring to the phrase “sneaking about”.Lincoln and Douglas debated at Jonesboro as candidates for theU.S. Senate. Lincoln, the candidate of the Republican Party, was challenging Douglas, the Democratic\n                  incumbent.  Douglas would go on to defeat Lincoln and retain his seat.
