One-third\n                  of the property taxes owed by Illinois residents was also allocated for the state,\n                  leaving two-thirds of the resident tax for the use of counties. As land began to pass\n                  from the ownership of out-of-state speculators into the ownership of residents, the\n                  state’s share of tax revenue had decreased. The 1839 Revenue law was designed to address\n                  the increasing revenue needs of the state.Robert Murray Haig,A History of the General Property Tax in Illinois, Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 1914 (Champaign: University of Illinois, 1914),\n                     40-42, 78-79."
