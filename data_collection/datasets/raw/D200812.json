        "text": "2During the1854 Federal Election, the voters of Sangamon County elected Lincoln to the Illinois General Assembly.\n                  Although he was an unwilling candidate for this position at first, passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened his passion for politics, and he threw himself into the congressional\n                  election campaign in the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  As the election campaign reached its climax, his name began circulating\n                  as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. Per\n                  article three, section seven of the1848 Illinois Constitution, however, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate. Lincoln’s\n                  decision not to accept his General Assembly seat freed him to pursue a seat in the\n                  U.S. Senate.In the special election held  on December 23, 1854 to fill his vacancy in the General\n                  Assembly,DemocratJonathan McDanieltriumphed overWhigNorman M. Broadwellby nearly 100 votes.Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the General Assembly\n                  selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:392, 401-2; David Herbert\n                     Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73, 185; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.
