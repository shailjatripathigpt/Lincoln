Seemingly a strongRepublicancounty, there are yet elements at work whichmaydefeat theLincolncandidate for theLegislature, and secure the election of aDouglasRepublican.3 There was a Republicanpaperhere two years ago, which theDemocratsbought up and which is now edited byJudge Mayo, who ran on theAnti-NebraskaDemocratic ticket forCongressagainstWoodworthin 1854.4Last year the Republicansstestablished thepaperwhich I am editing, and we barely succeeded, last fall, in carrying our regular Republican\n               county<Page 2>ticket against the \"People's Ticket\", headed by Judge Mayo.5The Judgeis a professedly anti-slavery man, and in his last issue came out in favor of^unqualified^\"negroequality,\" in so many words.6 Thisdoestakeamongaclassoftheanti-slaverymen—there is no dodging that.  It matters not how ridiculous it may seem to those out\n               of thecounty, and in more conservative sections— there are some very radical men here who say\n               that the Judge takes the stand that they have all along been desiring the Republicans\n               to take.  And the question now is, if the Judge runs for the Legislature, how many\n               of these anti-slavery men can he get to vote forhim, unmindful of the issue between Douglas and Lincoln.7One trouble in talking Lincoln to the people is thaththe people haven'tseenhim—don'tknowhim.  A great many of the anti-slavery men think he is a little tinctured with pro-slaveryism,<Page 3>because he was born in aslave state.  His speeches  have been extensively circulated, but if the people couldseehim,^and hear him speak,^all would be well. If the Judge wasn't a man who has lived in the county twenty years and knows every\n               man in it,whand if I had had a longer residence here than ten months, I should feel more likecopingrisking the issue.  As it is, I must say that should he run^for the Legislature^, or some one^else^that he can mould to his opinions,  I must say I fear that he can succeed inburyingcovering the issue.  HeIplainly says he doesn't endorse Douglas \"any  farther than he is right,\" so that\n               I can't fixtheupon him the odium ofDoug's inconsistencies. Perhaps I have wearied you.  I simply wanted to make it appear to you that we needed\n               Lincoln here in order to fix the people's attentionuponLincoln.

In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.
