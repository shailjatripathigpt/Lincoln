        "text": "2Evans references the competition over who would replaceRichard M. Youngas commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office.Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying for the position. Lincoln entered the competition after learning that\n                  Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.In early June 1849, Lincoln sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting\n                  letters in support of his candidacy. Presumably, Lincoln made a similar request of\n                  Evans, although no such letter from Lincoln to Evans has been located.  Lincoln commenced\n                  many of these letters in the same fashion: “Would you not as soon that I should have\n                  the General Land Office as any other Illinoisan?”  “Lief” and “liefer” mean gladly\n                  or willingly.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B.

        "text": "3Evans references Lincoln’s efforts to get Zachary Taylor nominated by theWhig Partyand elected president in1848.  Lincoln had actively worked to advance Taylor’s candidacy as a member of the so-called\n                  “Young Indians,” a Whig Executive Committee created in the spring of 1847 to provide\n                  the Whig Party with a unified national organization for theimminent presidential campaign. Including principally but not exclusively Southern Whigs, the Young Indians made\n                  it their goal to nominate Taylor as the Whig Party standard bearer in 1848.Neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job went to Butterfield\n                  instead.
