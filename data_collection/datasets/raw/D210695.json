Steele is mostly likely asking\n                  Lincoln about federal laws pertaining to summonses for theU.S. Circuit Court, Southern District of Illinois. In general, federal courts were required to follow state procedures. PerIllinoislaw at the time, summonses for any circuit court in the state were dated the day\n                  they were issued and made returnable on the first day of the next term of the circuit\n                  court involved in the lawsuit.

Marshall\n                  and Rives about the same time, requesting that the three men cooperate to select a\n                  viable Republican candidate for Illinois’ Eighteenth State Senate District, which\n                  included Coles, Cumberland, Edgar, andVermilioncounties. Lincoln preferred that they find a candidate who had supportedAmerican Partypresidential candidateMillard Fillmorein theelection of 1856. Marshall had supportedJohn C. Fremontin the election of 1856 and assisted Lincoln in his efforts to recruit Fillmore supporters\n                  to the Republican cause in that year. In the end, Marshall became the Republican Party’s\n                  candidate for the Eighteenth State Senate District and voters elected him to the Illinois\n                  Senate in November 1858.Thomas A.
