His visit attracted no more than\n                  twelve hundred attendees, approximately four hundred of whom were  proslavery Missourians.\n                  One newspaper reported that his topic only repeated recently published speeches and\n                  his oratorical effort, though an able one, was inferior to his abilities.Lincoln was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign.
