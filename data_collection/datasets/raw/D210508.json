Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored over\n                  Morrison and Edwards.As competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah M. Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position.  On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;Josiah M.
