        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln allowed his name to be affixed to this appeal, so the text is attributed\n                  to him, but the extent of his participation in its composition is unknown.This appeal was part of the Whig opposition tolegislationto reorganize the state judiciary.  For background to the struggle over the judiciary,\n                  seeIllinois Judiciary Act of 1841.The dating of this document is uncertain.  Roy P. Basler  estimated the date as February\n                  8, based on a reference in theIllinois State Registerof February 12, 1841, which read in part: “We learn that members of the Federal party\n                  met in caucus one night last week, concocted a remonstrance against the judiciary\n                  bill, filled with the most unheard of misrepresentations, have since printed ten thousand\n                  copies thereof, and sent them to the various secret committees in different parts\n                  of the State which were organized previous to thefall elections.  The object is to create panic amongst the people...”  Further strengthening the\n                  date as February 8 is the authors’s mention of the Council of Revisions’ objections\n                  (paragraph eight) to the bill, which the Council relayed to the Senate on the afternoon\n                  of that date.  The Illinois State Register, however, speculated that the purpose of\n                  the authors  in composing and distributing the remonstrance was “the vain hope that\n                  the council of revision will return the bill with objections!,” suggesting a date\n                  earlier than February 8.  Further clouding the issue is the calling for a convention\n                  of the people (paragraph 9), implying a date after the House of Representatives and\n                  Senate re-passed the bill over the Council’s objections, which occurred on February\n                  10.Illinois State Register(Springfield), 12 February 1841, 4:6; Roy P.
