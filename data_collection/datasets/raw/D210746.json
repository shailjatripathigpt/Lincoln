        "text": "2The enclosure Moseley references is shown in the second image.By \"an Egyptian liar,\" Moseley is most likely alluding to the biblical story of the\n                  Egyptian midwives Shiphrah and Puah, who, fearful of God, disobeyed the Egyptian pharaoh's\n                  command to kill male infants born to Israelites. When the pharaoh asked Shiphrah and\n                  Puah why they disobeyed him, Shiphrah and Puah lied and claimed that the Israelite\n                  mothers gave birth before the midwives arrived. God rewarded Shiphrah and Puah, despite\n                  the fact that they lied. Many adherents of the Christian faith have interpreted this\n                  story as evidence that it is sometimes possible for lies to serve God's ends. By calling\n                  the lies in the enclosed document \"a far specimen of an Egyptian liar,\" Moseley likely\n                  interprets them as far from God's ends.Exodus, 1:15-21; George Hay,The Devout Christian Instructed in the Law and Faith of Christ, ed. John Murdoch (Glasgow: Denis Kennedy, 1831), 2:217."

At the time, the members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore,\n                  the local races for the General Assembly were highly relevant to the outcome of the\n                  state’s U.S. Senate race.

Editors of Democratic newspapers in Illinois often accused the\n                  Republican Party of being anabolitionist, antislavery, and/or pro-emancipation party.
