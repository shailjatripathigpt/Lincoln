    "full_text": "Petition of Samuel D. Lockwood and Others to George W. Crawford, [February 1850]1 The undersigned, citizens of the State ofIllinois, beg leave to recommend to your consideration the name ofNapoleonKoscialowski, for the appointment ofMajor, should there be a disposable post of that rank, in one of the Regiments to be raised\n               for the protection of the U.S. frontier.2We make this recommendation more earnestly, because we believe that yourDepartmentcannot possibly make a better appointment. MrKoscialowski is a native ofPoland, and has been bred and has served as a soldier. He entered a military school atWarsawat the age of sixteen, and having graduated then served three years in Body-Guard\n               of theEmperor of Russia. He quitted that corps and joined his national banner in the year 1830., when the\n               Poles made their bold but unfortunate attempt to regain their national independence.3After several years' imprisonment, consequent upon the failure of the revolt, he\n               with some others succeeded in making his escape to this country, and became a citizen\n               of the U.S. in 1834. In 1846, when War was declared againstMexico, he volunteered and having raised a company in St Louis, was elected Captain and served as such until discharged. He then volunteered again\n               for the Term of During theWar, and commanded a Company on the Western frontier until Peace was concluded and he\n               was discharged. In the course of this service, he has necessarily acquired much experience\n               in the kind of warfare to which the frontier Regiments are destined– and we think,\n               and so respectfully represent, that this experience added to his education in a regular\n               Military Academy, peculiarly fits him for the station to which we recommend him. As\n               an accomplished civil engineer, also, we are the more confident that his services\n               will be valuable to his adopted country– MrKoscialowski is a resident ofJacksonville, Illinois.4",

Scott argued that “threats of hostilities” on the U.S. frontier as well as the recent\n                  acquisition of territory from Mexico necessitated this increase in U.S. military forces.\n                  PresidentZachary Taylorendorsed Scott’s recommendations during his annual address to theU.S. Congress, which he delivered on December 24, 1849.On June 17, 1850, Congress passed an act to increase the rank and file of the U.S.\n                  Army and encourage enlistments. The act specifically empowered the president of the\n                  United States to increase the number of privates serving on the western frontier as\n                  well as at “remote and distant stations.” The act made no mention of an accompanying\n                  increase in the number of U.S. Army officers, however.H.R.

        "text": "3This is a reference to the Polish-Russian War of 1830-31, which began when a group\n                  of young Polish officers attending the Warsaw Military Academy revolted against theRussian Empire’s rule of Poland. Newspapers in the United States covered the war with great interest,\n                  and the editors of many papers drew strong parallels between the Polish struggle for\n                  independence and theAmerican Revolution. Ultimately, however, Russian forces encircled the city of Warsaw and defeated the\n                  Polish revolutionaries.Joseph W.
