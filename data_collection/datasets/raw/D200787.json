        "text": "4At the outbreak of theBlack Hawk War, Lincoln volunteered for theIllinois State Militia. On April 21, 1832, Lincoln and other men from theNew Salemarea were mustered into a company in theFourth Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers, and the members of the company elected Lincoln as their captain. When his month\n                  of service ended, Lincoln re-enlisted twice, for twenty and thirty days respectively,\n                  serving as a private both times. He was finally discharged on July 10, 1832.On September 28, 1850, theU.S. Congresspassed an act granting certain groups who had served in the United States military\n                  during theWar of 1812, any of “the Indian wars” since 1790, or theMexican Warparcels of public land. Per this act, the amount of land that veterans (or their\n                  legal heirs) were entitled to depended upon the length of their engagement and actual\n                  time served. Under this act, Lincoln was entitled to forty acres of public land for\n                  the time he served as captain of the Fourth Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers.\n                  Davies acted as Lincoln’s attorney at the land office in Dubuque, and on July 21,\n                  1854, he oversaw the  certification of Lincoln’s land warrant and applied to locate\n                  Lincoln’s bounty lands as described here. The warrant was then filed with theU.S. General Land OfficeinWashington, DC, and a patent for these forty acres  inTama County, Iowawas issued to Lincoln  on June 1, 1855.Lincoln eventually received another 120 acres of land for his service during the Black\n                  Hawk War after a federal law passed in 1855 declared that all who had served in any\n                  U.S. war since 1790 were entitled to 160 acres of land in total. The additional 120-acre\n                  parcel of bounty land that Lincoln patented on September 10, 1860 was located in Crawford\n                  County, Iowa, 144 miles west of his Tama County land. There is no evidence that Lincoln\n                  ever received any revenue from any of these bounty lands. After his assassination,\n                  since he did not leave a will, the forty acres of Tama County land passed in one-third\n                  equal divisions toMary Lincoln,Robert T. Lincoln, andThomas “Tad” Lincoln. The Crawford County land also passed to the remaining Lincoln family.Muster Roll of Abraham Lincoln’s Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Abraham Lincoln’s Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Captain Elijah Iles’ Company of Mounted Volunteers;Muster Roll of Captain Jacob M.
