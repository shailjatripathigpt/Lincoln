The newlawchanged the board from seven to just three commissioners, elected by the General\n                  Assembly, who would keep an office inSpringfield. The law required the previous commissioners to settle accounts and to deliver all\n                  property and records to the new Board headquartered in Springfield. It is possible\n                  that Lincoln and Strong provided legal work related to this effort. In the late 1830s,\n                  Lincoln generally charged from $5-10 for each case he handled. Therefore, the $50\n                  fee here likely represented a significant amount of legal work for him.An Act to Establish and Maintain a General System of Internal Improvements;An Act to Provide for the Settlement of Debts and Liabilities Incurred on Account\n                        of Internal Improvements in the State of Illinois; Martha L.
