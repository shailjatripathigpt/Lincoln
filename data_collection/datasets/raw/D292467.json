He talked bitterly— somewhat so—\n               against the papers inIlls— and said they were fools. I asked him this question— “Greely— do you want to see a 3d[3rd] party organized, or do you want Douglas to rise to power through the North, whichDouglas^he^has so much abused and betrayed?” and to which he replied “Let the future alone:\n               it will all come right– Douglas is a brave man.

Since I have landed in Boston I have seen much that was entertaining and interesting.\n               This morning I was introduced toGovrBanks. He and I had a conversation aboutRepublicanismand specially about Douglas. He asked me this question— “You will sustain Douglas\n               inIllinois— won’t you—” and to which I said, “no—never.” He affected to be much surprised and so the matter dropt and turned on Republicanism in general—Lincoln, Greely and those other sheets that laud Douglas—Harris— &C.[etc] want them sustained and willtryto do it.

        "text": "4Although Douglas later denied courting Republican support, he met with Greeley in\n                  person and hinted to other Republicans via correspondence that he was finished with\n                  the Democratic Party. Through theNew York Tribune, Greeley urged voters in Illinois to support Douglas’ reelection campaign. He also\n                  wrote  Republican leaders in Illinois to urge the same. Greeley was not alone—many\n                  Republicans in the eastern U.S. were excited by Douglas’ split with Buchanan andpro-LecomptonDemocrats, and similarly urged voters to reelect Douglas. Nathaniel P. Banks and\n                  William H. Seward lauded Douglas’ actions with regard to the Lecompton Constitution,\n                  and Seward was even rumored to have struck a bargain to back Douglas’ reelection to\n                  the Senate in 1858 in exchange for Seward’s elevation to  the presidency in1860(although Abraham Lincoln eventually concluded no such bargain had been made).Lincoln advised his fellow Republicans to stay out of the Democrats’ battle and remain\n                  loyal to the Republican Party in the impending election. Herndon aided Lincoln in\n                  this effort by gathering information and conferring with political allies.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:446-48; 452-54; Glyndon G.
