        "text": "2Grimshaw references the state elections inIllinois, which occurred on November 2, 1858.   Abraham Lincoln, the candidate of theRepublican Party, was challengingStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for seat in theU.S. Senate.   Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering\n                  speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat.  Lincoln and Douglas alsodebatedat seven Illinois towns  during the campaign.

Pro-Douglas\n                  Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly, however,  and Douglas\n                  ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however, and in\n                  particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained\n                  recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:556-57; Allen C.

        "text": "4Grimshaw lived in Pike County during the state and federal elections of 1858.  Voters\n                  in Pike County sent Democrats to the Illinois House and Senate, all of whom voted\n                  for Douglas in the U.S. Senate contest.   Voters gave Democratic candidates majorities\n                  of just over 500 votes.Pike County was part of the Illinois Fifth Congressional District. In the congressional\n                  election of 1858, Democrat incumbent Isaac N. Morris won reelection.  Pike County\n                  voters gave Morris a 480-vote majority over this Republican opponent.  In the district\n                  overall, Morris had a 1,881-majority.Douglas’s second wife,Adele, was aCatholic, and two of his sons were being educated at a Jesuit school inWashington, DC.  TheRepublican State Central Committeesought to exploit Douglas’s connection to Catholicism and the Democratic Party’s\n                  dependence on Irish Catholic votes to enhance Lincoln’s electoral chances.  Republican\n                  stump speakers raised the specter of a “Celtic invasion” of Illinois electoral districts,\n                  suggesting that Irish Americans building theIllinois Central Railroadwould commit voter fraud on Douglas’s behalf, to convince old Whigs to vote for Lincoln\n                  candidates to the General Assembly.  The Republicans also sought to divide Irish American\n                  and German Americans in hopes of getting votes  in the larger German American community.\n                  These tactics proved ineffective as Douglas was able to label Republicans as enemies\n                  of all immigrants and Catholics,  not just Irish American laborers.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 13 November 1858, 2:3;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 11 November 1858, 2:5; Illinois SenateJournal. 1859. 21st G.
