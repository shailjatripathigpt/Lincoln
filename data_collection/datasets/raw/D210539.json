However, it was most likely a letter of reference for Abraham Lincoln’s\n                  appointment as commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. In early June 1849, Lincoln sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting\n                  letters in support of his candidacy for commissioner.Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. In late May 1849, LincolnwroteThompson a letter on the topic of Butterfield winning the appointment.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B. Herrick;Abraham Lincoln to James M.
