Archibald Williams lived inAdams County,which was part of the Fifth Judicial Circuit which, as of 1847, includedPike,Fulton,Schuyler,Brown,Hancock,Henderson,Warren,Knox, andMcDonoughcounties.  At a Whig meeting held inPittsfieldon May 11, delegates chose Isaac Vandeventer to represent the Fifth Circuit in Philadelphia.\n                  They also passed a resolution instructing Vandeventer to use his influence to get\n                  Zachary Taylor nominated as the Whig candidate in thepresidential election of 1848.Illinois Journal(Springfield), 11 May 1848, 1:7; 8 June 1848, 2:1; 15 June 1848, 2:1, 4; “An Act\n                     Extending the Limits of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, and Fixing the Times for Holding\n                     Courts Therein,” 5 February 1847,Laws of Illinois(1847), 43."

        "text": "3Clay lost New York by 5,106, and that narrow loss cost him the election.   TheLiberty Partypolled 15,812 in New York; had Clay received only a third of those votes, he would\n                  have won.  Some Whigs attributed Clay’s loss  to the Liberty Party and the refusal\n                  of abolitionists to vote for Clay, though other Whigs blame Clay’s loss on his waffling\n                  on the annexation of Texas.Michael F.
