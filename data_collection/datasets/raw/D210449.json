        "text": "1Philo H. Thompson enclosed this copy in aletterto Abraham Lincoln dated May 3, 1849.  Lincoln enclosed the original petition in\n                  aletterto Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing.   The original petition is not extant.This petition and Thompson’sletterrepresented the culmination of sorts of an extended controversy over Turner R. King’s\n                  appointment--a controversy in which Lincoln became embroiled.   In December 1848,\n                  ThompsonwroteLincoln urging him to help King get a job at the General Land Office in Springfield.\n                  From December 1848 to February 1849, Lincoln received several letters urging him to\n                  help King secure a position.  On April 7, 1849, Lincoln wrote aletterto Secretary Ewing recommending King for the job of register.    On April 13, he\n                  wrote anotherletterreversing himself, recommending King for the job of receiver.On April 25, LincolnwroteThompson that a “tirade” has erupted over his support for King.Whigsin Springfield were upset that Lincoln had endorsed King for a plum patronage job\n                  instead of someone fromSangamon County.  Hoping to scuttle King’s appointment, opponents cast aspersions on King’s moral\n                  rectitude.  Lincoln bemoaned that his influence inWashingtonhad broken down and that King’s prospects for a job had diminished.  Lincoln urged\n                  Thompson to find out the truth about King, and, if the charges proved false, to take\n                  measures to sustain his endorsement of King.  In the meantime, LincolnwroteSecretary Ewing  attempting to head off any charges against King or his other recommendations\n                  for jobs in the Department of the Interior.Acting on Lincoln’s request,  Thompson crafted a petition denying the allegations\n                  leveled against King and secured the signatures of prominent Whigs andDemocratsin Tazewell County.  Between April 30 and May 7,Samuel R. Baker,Edward Jones,John W. Casey, andDavid Markwrote Lincoln attesting to King’s moral character and his fitness for public office.\n                  Lincoln penned anotherletterto Ewing on May 10, again recommending King for the job of register.  Lincoln enclosed\n                  these letters, Thompson’sletter, and the signed petition in hisletterto Ewing, urging Ewing to pay particular attention to the petition.  In late May,\n                  King received the appointment as register  and held the job until 1853.William B. Doolittle to Abraham Lincoln;Robert W. Briggs to Abraham Lincoln;Richard T.
