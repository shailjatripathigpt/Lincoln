In January\n                  1853, Bachop and Lamm agreed to arbitration to resolve an outstanding land dispute.\n                  Lamm agreed to relinquish a quitclaim deed on 360 acres of land in return for a $125\n                  promissory note from Bachop.  Bachop failed to pay the note, and in May 1853, Lamm\n                  sued Bachop in an action of assumpsit in theVermilion County Circuit Courtfor payment of the note.  Bachop retained Lincoln,Ward Hill Lamon, andOliver L. Davis; Lamm retainedJohn H. Murphy.  Lincoln, Lamon, and Davis pleaded that Bachop had made no written agreement with\n                  Lamm.  In October 1853, the court ruled for Bachop.Affidavit, Praecipe, Document ID: 59827; Narratio, Document ID: 59818; Order, Document\n                     ID: 59835, 59836,Lamm v. Bachop, Martha L.
