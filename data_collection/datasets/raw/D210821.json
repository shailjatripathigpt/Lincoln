        "text": "2If Lincoln replied to this letter, his response has not been located.Stephen A. Douglas was one of theDemocratic Party’s primary proponents of popular sovereignty—the concept that local voters had the\n                  right to determine whether or not to allow slavery. Douglas advocated on behalf of\n                  popular sovereignty with regard to both  the Kansas-Nebraska Act and theLecompton Constitution, the latter of which he asserted ran counter to popular sovereignty as it did not\n                  permit theKansas Territory’s voters to disallow slavery.Lincoln was running against Douglas in the1858 Federal Electionas theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. Although Lincoln had long supported protective tariffs, both he and Douglas agreed\n                  that slavery was a topic of far greater importance in the contests of 1858. During\n                  the campaign, Lincoln criticized theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Dred Scott case as aiding the nationalization of slavery.  For\n                  some of Lincoln’s views on popular sovereignty, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Lecompton\n                  Constitution, and the Dred Scott decision, see Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois.  See also the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and\n                  in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 110, 200-205, 207-9; First Debate with Stephen A.
