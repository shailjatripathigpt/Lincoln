        "text": "2In a July 31, 1850 letter to Lincoln that has not been located, John Addison intimated\n                  that he was being retaliated against in some way for his support of Lincoln. Addison\n                  was a clerk in theU.S. Department of the Interiorduring theGeneral Land Office Affair, a lengthy competition for the position of commissioner of theU.S. General Land Officein which Lincoln eventually participated. Ultimately, in June 1849, PresidentZachary Taylorawarded the position toJustin H. Butterfield.During the competition for the position, supporters of each candidate sent letters\n                  of reference and recommendation to both Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. Although the U.S. Department of the Interior oversaw the U.S. General Land Office,\n                  President Taylor was ultimately responsible for appointing the commissioner of the\n                  U.S. General Land Office. Following the appointment of Butterfield, LincolnwroteEwing June 22, 1849, requesting that all letters of recommendation and reference\n                  filed with the U.S. Department of the Interior pertaining to his candidacy for commissioner\n                  be returned to him. Ewing complied, returning all but three of the letters from Lincoln’s\n                  file. Lincoln suspected that  the letters written byRichard W. ThompsonandElisha Embreewere purposefully omitted by someone at the Department of the Interior in order to\n                  give Butterfield an advantage over him in the competition for the job. In the end,\n                  Lincoln chose not to make his suspicions public, explaining to Addison that his loyalty\n                  to both Taylor and “the greatwhigcause” induced him to remain silent. But he acknowledged Addison’s claims of being\n                  unfairly targeted  by someone, which, he wrote, “fills me with indignation.” The perpetrator\n                  could have been Butterfield but was most likely Ewing.On April 22, 1850, theDemocrat-controlledU.S. House of Representativesformed a committee underWilliam A. Richardsonto investigate Ewing’s role in and handling of patronage appointments as well as\n                  his management of pension payments and Department of the Interior accounts. On June\n                  8, 1850, theNew York Heraldreported that Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office was one patronage appointment that the Richardson Committee was investigating,\n                  particularly with regard to letters missing from the file on Lincoln that was shown\n                  to President Taylor prior to Taylor selecting the final appointee. However, when the\n                  committee filed its final reports on September 4-7, 1850, it made no finding regarding\n                  Butterfield’s appointment. The Whig-controlledU.S. Senatealso exonerated Ewing of all charges, although suspicions remained in some Whig circles\n                  that Ewing had indeed suppressed letters of recommendation from Lincoln’s  file.Abraham Lincoln to John Addison;John Addison to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to John Addison;Abraham Lincoln to John Addison;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851), 149; H.R.

This letter of recommendation was at least the third time Lincoln attempted\n                  to help Addison secure a federal appointment. Addison’s name appears in the official\n                  register of the officers and agents of the government for 1851 as a clerk in the Department\n                  of the Interior’s pension office. However, his name does not appear in the official\n                  register for 1853, so apparently, he did not receive another federal appointment following\n                  the pension office position.John Addison to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to John Addison;Abraham Lincoln to John Addison;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851, 149;Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853)."
