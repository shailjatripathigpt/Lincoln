At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  In local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but Pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal ElectionLincoln and Douglas engaged inseven debatesduring the campaign, and Lincoln’s speeches and accounts of the debates became sought\n                  after by publishers.  Reports of Lincoln’s speeches and the debates appeared in contemporary\n                  newspapers, from which Lincoln compiled a scrapbook that served as the source for the first publication of all the debates in 1860. \n                  Lincoln transmitted the scrapbook to the publisher on December 19, 1859.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-61, 476-77, 513-14,\n                     546-47; Allen C.
