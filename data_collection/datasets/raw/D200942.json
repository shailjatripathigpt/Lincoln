        "text": "3Lincoln had been on retainer with the Illinois Central Railroad since the autumn of\n                  1853 but was apparently uncertain of his current employment with the railroad due\n                  to their delinquency in paying him. In July 1856,  he had presented the railroad’s\n                  attorneys with a bill for his work on behalf of the Illinois Central in the case ofIllinois Central RR v. McLean County, Illinois & Parke. That case had been finally decided in January 1856 in theIllinois Supreme Court, which upheld the railroad’s charter as constitutional, and affirmed that under the\n                  charter counties could not tax the railroad. At the time of this letter, Lincoln was\n                  still awaiting payment from the railroad, and he ultimately instituted a suit against\n                  the Illinois Central inMcLean County Circuit Courtin April 1857 in order to collect his fees in the case. He claimed $6,000 in damages\n                  and was awarded $5,000 by a jury in June 1857. This amount was adjusted down to $4,800\n                  in consideration of a retainer Lincoln had earlier received from the railroad. He\n                  received payment from the railroad in this amount in August 1857.Receipt of Abraham Lincoln to Illinois Central Railroad Company;Abraham Lincoln to Ebenezer Lane;Illinois Central RR v.
