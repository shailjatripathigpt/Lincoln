        "text": "2Between 1821 and 1850, James M. Duncan acquired more than 570 acres of land in Fayette\n                  County. His brother, formerIllinoisGovernor Joseph Duncan, died in 1844. James M. Duncan became an executor of his brother’s\n                  will, but it is unclear if he inherited any of his brother’s land.In this letter, Lincoln advised Jacob Ritter to ensure that James M. Duncan possessed\n                  title to the forty acres of land in Fayette County that Ritter wished to purchase.\n                  Since it was  common for creditors to secure liens upon the property of their debtors,\n                  Lincoln also advised Ritter to check that Duncan had no liens upon the land from debts.\n                  (A lien is a charge or security interest attached to real or personal property to\n                  satisfy a debt.) No additional correspondence between Lincoln and Ritter has been\n                  located.Illinois Public Domain Land Tract Sales, Fayette County, 146:12, 57, 150:4, 10, Illinois State Archives, Springfield, IL;\n                     U.S. General Land Office Records, 1776-2015, Fayette County, IL, Certificate #8561;\n                     Certificate #10182 (Provo, UT: Ancestry,com, 2008);Illinois, U.S., Wills and Probate Records, 1772-1999, 18 January 1844, Morgan County\n                     (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com, 2015); “Lien,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
