        "text": "2The district in question was the Sixth Congressional District ofIllinois, which included bothSangamon CountyandMorgan County, home toJacksonville. The nascent IllinoisRepublican Partyconsidered several candidates to run for theU.S. House of Representativesagainst incumbentDemocratThomas L. Harris in the district in 1856.Richard Yates, who had lost his reelection bid for the seat to Harris in the1854 election, refused to run again. Lincoln and other Republican leaders met in July 1856 with\n                  the hope of persuadinganti-NebraskaDemocratJohn M. Palmerto be their party’s candidate for the seat, but he declined.By early September,Springfieldmerchant John Williams had been chosen to run instead, and was touted as a hardworking\n                  “honestClayWhig” who threatened to win the votes ofAmerican Partysupporters  and of anti-slavery Democrats. Harris defeated him handily, garnering\n                  54 percent of the vote to Williams’ 46 percent. At the end of Williams’ life, it was\n                  claimed that he outperformed a Democratic majority of 4,000 voters in losing by only\n                  about 2,100 votes. Yates, however, had lost the seat by only 200 votes in the previous\n                  election.James N.

        "text": "4Sturtevant’s praise of Lincoln may have been prompted by a  lengthyspeechLincoln had recently given at a rally in support ofJohn C. Fremontin Jacksonville on Saturday, September 6, 1856. From July 1856 onwards, Lincoln gave\n                  over fifty speeches across Illinois in support of Fremont’spresidential campaignand to rally the disparate elements of the emerging Republican Party. See the1856 Federal Election.It may have been this speech in Jacksonville that Sturtevant alluded to later in life\n                  when he recalled the first time he heard Lincoln speak on the subject of slavery,\n                  which was in an address to a crowd of 2,000 drawn from Morgan and surrounding counties\n                  at an unspecified date. In Sturtevant’s recollection, Lincoln’s speech not only argued\n                  against the extension of slavery to the territories, but also denounced slavery on\n                  the grounds of natural theology. As Sturtevant remembered, this speech was the moment\n                  he realized that Lincoln was a great man.Lincoln’s Jacksonville speech of September 6, 1856 seems to have made a strong impression\n                  in Sturtevant’s community. His formerIllinois CollegecolleagueJonathan B. Turnerhad attended and was himself moved by the occasion towriteto Lincoln. According to Turner, everyone he spoke to after the speech was eager\n                  to elect Lincoln to political office.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:425-33; J. M.
