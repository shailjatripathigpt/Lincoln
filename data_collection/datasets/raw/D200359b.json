    "full_text": "Summary of Proceedings of Public Meeting at Springfield regarding Philadelphia Riots,\n               12 June 18441 FEDERALWHIGS, ALIAS NATIVE AMERICANS. Mr.Lincolnon Wednesday evening of last week, at a meeting of the whigs convened for the purpose\n               of investigating the causes of thePhiladelphiariots, said that he had not yet seen an account of this affair which he could rely\n               upon astrue—(I should like to know howheis to judge of the correctness of any report.) But if he is really without information\n               on this subject, I refer him to a letter in theNew York Tribune, (a leading whig paper) of May 15, ’44[1844], “from the pen of aprotestant, on the spot, and whose love of truth and fairness is vouched for by the editors\n               of that Journal;”—and I would here most respectfully ask Mr. Lincoln to use his influence\n               with Mr.Francisto have that letter published for the purpose of correcting, what Imustcall, the slanderous misrepresentations of theSangamo Journal.  With the account given by the New York Tribune, I most cheerfully concur, as one\n               intimately acquainted with the characters and political principles of all the actors\n               therein named, and with the entirelocaleof the late disturbances.  And as it does show that theNative Whigscommenced the aggression, and as the writer’s character for “truth and fairness”\n               is endorsed byMr. Greely, Mr. Lincolncannotdoubt it.  Mr. Lincoln however was incorrect in stating that theCatholicsdemanded the exclusion of the Bible from the public schools: this theyneverasked for; all they wanted was the privilege, as it was undoubtedly their right,\n               of introducing and using their own translation Mr. Lincoln expressed the kindest, and most benevolent feelings towards foreigners;\n               they were, I doubt not, the sincere and honest sentiments ofhis heart; but they were not those ofhis party. Whiggery has never avowed them.  Mr. Lincoln also alleged that the whigs were as\n               much the friends of foreigners asdemocrats; but he failed to substantiate it in a manner satisfactory to the foreigners who\n               heard him. But if he will accept of my assistance, I will endeavor to show that they\n               have been remarkably friendly to foreigners—after a way of their own. The first great head of their party,George III, laid heavy restrictions upon the emigration of foreigners to these States.  In 1794\n               Mr.Rufus Kingopposed the admission ofAlbert Gallatinto his seat in theUnited States Senate, because he was a foreigner.  The same Rufus King, as I have observed before, five\n               years afterwards while minister at theCourt of St. Jamesprevented a large number of distinguished Irishmen from coming here because they\n               entertained republican principles.  In 1798 they enacted an Alien law for purposes\n               explained in my communication of last week.  In 1814 the whig Hartford convention recommended that the Constitution be so amended as to declare all foreigners\n               ineligible to a seat in the Senate orHouse of Representatives, or to hold any civil office under the authority of the United States.  In 1838 Mr.Matthew L. Davis(uncle to Mr.Geo. T. M. Davis, editor of theAlton Telegraph) in one of his letters said— “Had I the power I would erect a gallows upon every\n               wharf in the city ofNew Yorkand hang every d—d[damned] Irishman as fast as they came on shore.”  In the same year Mr.Aaron Clark, whig-native Mayor of New York, denied to foreigners admission within the corporate\n               limits of thatcity.  One of his coadjutors,Ald. Bruen, in a speech in the council room said— “if Irishmen assisted in obtaining our independence\n               they have been well paid for it,”—and he “thanked God that the power of adopted citizens\n               was at an end.—(Niles’ Register, vol. 54, p. 226.)  In 1838 in theSenate of New York,Gen. Rootspoke of foreigners as “paupers, strangers, sojourners, loafers and other cattle.”\n               In the same year again, the Hon.David Russell, M. C.[Member of Congress] from New York made a report on foreign paupers and naturalization laws; which a writer\n               in theExtra Globespeaks  of as being a “complete digest of all the brains and bile, hypochondriaism\n               and monomaniaism of the Native faction.  (Congressional Report 1838.)  Mr.Clayalso, in Jan.[January] 1838, voted for Mr.Merrick’s resolution which excluded foreigners from settling upon the public lands—thus proving\n               to the satisfaction of every reasonable man, that in hisprofessionsof friendship, six years before,  he was hollow-hearted, treacherous and unprincipled.\n               Who can doubt after all this that whigs are friends to foreigners?  But to make it\n               more clear to them let us view the conduct of a leading and distinguished democrat,\n               as contrasted with that of a (not very) distinguished whig on the floor of ourNational Legislatureon presenting a petition to reduce our foreign population to the condition of Russian\n               serfs; in vulgar parlance, praying for the repeal of the naturalization laws.  Some\n               weeks since, Mr.Buchananpresented to the Senate a petition for the repeal of the existing naturalization\n               laws.  This, as a representative, he was bound to do—but, at the same time, he positively\n               and solemnly declared to the Senate that he would oppose that petitition with all the energies with all the abilities, and with all the influence which he\n               possessed.  As I have not his remarks before me, I cannot quote his language, but\n               this wasspeakinglike a democrat, and he will be as good as his word. Now mark the contrast—on the 6th of February, 1840 the Hon.John T. Stuart, the whig representative in Congress of what was then the 3d Congressional district\n               inIllinoispresented a petition to the House of Representatives asking that “body to repeal\n               entirely the laws which now exist in regard to the naturalization of foreigners.”\n               Well, on presenting that petition, did Mr. Stuart express his dissent?  No; not he;\n               but by his silence he sanctioned it.  This wasactinglike a Whig. J. R. D.",
