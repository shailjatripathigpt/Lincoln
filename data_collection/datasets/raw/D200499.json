        "text": "3This is a reference to the competition over who would replaceRichard M. Youngas commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, and Cyrus Edwards were vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition\n                  after learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. Lincoln also\n                  received correspondence informing him that Edwards had withdrawn himself as a candidate\n                  so that Lincoln could enter the competition and defeat Butterfield. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Supporters of each candidate sent letters of reference and recommendation to both\n                  PresidentZachary Taylorand Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. Although theU.S. Department of the Interioroversaw the U.S. General Land Office, President Taylor was ultimately responsible\n                  for appointing the commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office. In alettertoJoseph Gillespiein July 1849, Lincoln wrote that he was aware Edwards wrote a letter in support of\n                  Butterfield and filed it with the Department of the Interior. Lincoln had additional\n                  correspondence with Ewing on the topic of letters sent to the Department of the Interior\n                  in support of his qualifications for the position.Josiah M.
