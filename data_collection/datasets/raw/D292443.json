Buchanan defeated Fremont to become fifteenth president of the United States. He\n                  captured Illinois with 44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont and 15.7\n                  for Fillmore. Voters in the four northern congressional districts sent Republicans\n                  to theU.S. House of Representatives. In southern Illinois, voters in the five congressional districts in that part of\n                  the state sent Democrats to the U.S. House. Illinoisans from southern Illinois also\n                  went overwhelmingly for Buchanan. Voters in the eighteen counties in the Ninth Illinois\n                  Congressional District, which encompassed most of southern Illinois, gave Buchanan\n                  71 percent of the votes to 25 percent for Fillmore and only 4 percent for Fremont.\n                  See the1856 Federal Election.Howard W.
