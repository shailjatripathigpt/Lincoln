        "text": "3Johnston wanted to sell both the land that he owned and the land that his mother,Sarah Lincoln, owned as part of her dower inherited after her husband,Thomas Lincoln, died. Dower was a form of estate that provided for a widow’s needs out of her husband's\n                  real and personal property, and such property was not subject to creditor’s demands.\n                  In antebellumIllinois, the widow of a man with children received one-third of the land that her husband\n                  owned at any time during their marriage for the rest of her life, unless she relinquished\n                  her dower rights in the prescribed manner. If her deceased husband had no children,\n                  the widow received outright ownership of one-half of the estate.In Sarah Lincoln’s case, since Abraham Lincoln was his father’s sole heir, she was\n                  due one-third of the land that Thomas Lincoln had owned during their marriage. In\n                  adeeddated August 12, 1851, Abraham andMary Lincolngifted Johnston the land which Lincoln had inherited from his father. However, Sarah\n                  Lincoln’s right of dower passed along with this transfer of property, meaning that\n                  the land Abraham  and Mary Lincoln gifted Johnston in the deed was still subject to\n                  her right of dower. She remained entitled to one-third of the land that Thomas Lincoln\n                  had owned during their marriage.Lincoln wrote Johnston anotherletteron this topic on November 25, 1851.Abraham Lincoln to John D.
