        "text": "1On March 3, 1837, the Illinois General Assembly had passedlegislationappointing Dr. Anson G. Henry one of four commissioners for the construction of the\n                  statehouse in the new capital of Springfield.\n                  \n                  At the same time, Henry was challenging James Adams for the post of Sangamon County\n                  Probate Justice of the Peace—a campaign that became increasingly contentious and eventually\n                  culminated in Adams’ win on August 7. TheIllinois Republican, a Democratic newspaper in Springfield, attacked Henry’s appointment as a partisan\n                  political appointment for an unqualified candidate. On June 24, Dr. Henry called for\n                  a public meeting to convene that day “for the purpose of enquiring into the truth\n                  or falsity of said charges.”Also appearing in theSangamo Journalon June 17 and 24, and later on July 8, 15, 22, and 29, were six letters signed\n                  “Sampson’s Ghost,” in which the author or authors condemned Adams for defrauding Mary\n                  Anderson out of her husband’s land. (“Sampson” was Andrew Sampson, who had leased\n                  property to Adams with the understanding that the latter would pay the property taxes\n                  and that Sampson would be allowed to reclaim the land if he compensated Adams for\n                  any improvements he might make to the land. Adams eventually claimed the tract for\n                  himself, though it clearly belonged to Sampson. The author conflated Sampson and Anderson.)\n                  The author or authors also accused Adams of writing and planting letters in the Democratic\n                  press to injure Anson G. Henry, his opponent in the election for probate justice of\n                  the peace.Given the details from the Anderson case and the contentious circumstances surrounding\n                  the election, these letters were possibly the work of Lincoln and his colleagues Stuart,\n                  Baker, and Logan. Charges that Lincoln made explicit in hishandbillandsubsequentrepliesto Adams’s rejoinders were more vague in the “Sampson’s Ghost” letters, but it is\n                  obvious that only the attorneys and their associates defending Mary and Richard Anderson\n                  would have been aware of the evidence upon which the author or authors made their\n                  accusations. Some contemporaries believed that the letters originated with Lincoln\n                  alone, and some modern scholars have also assigned Lincoln sole authorship, including\n                  the editors ofThe Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition, who included the “Sampson’s Ghost” letters as part of the case file forWright et al. v. Adams. Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, did not include them, believing that Lincoln scholars had been “somewhat precipitous\n                  in assigning Lincoln’s authorship.” In the instance of pseudonymous or anonymous articles\n                  published in newspapers, Basler and his editors excluded all but those which they\n                  could prove were “incontrovertibly Lincoln’s.” Adams believed the letters came from\n                  a group rather than one individual, and Basler could find no internal evidence within\n                  the letters to determine conclusively that they came from Lincoln’s pen. \n                  Subsequent to the publication of the handbill and Lincoln’s replies to Adams’s rejoinders,\n                  theSangamo Journalon September 30 and October 7, published letters from “An Old Settler” offering evidence\n                  of Adams’ dubious character and improper conduct in a land transaction with Elijah\n                  Iles. These missives may or may not have come from Lincoln, but incontrovertible evidence\n                  to his authorship could not be found, so Basler left them out of this edition. The\n                  editors of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln have largely followed Basler’s policy in\n                  regard to the “Sampson’s Ghost” letters and other pseudonymous or anonymous articles\n                  found in the press.Wright et al. v. Adamslanguished in the Sangamon County Circuit Court, the Schuyler County Circuit Court,\n                  and again in the Sangamon County Circuit Court until Adams died, whereupon the Sangamon\n                  County Circuit Court abated the case.Wright et al. v.
