He had pledged to serve only one term, but many Whigs in the district\n                  favored his renomination. Lincoln was not averse to running again, butStephen T. Loganreceived the nomination. In August 1848, Logan would lose toThomas L. Harrisin a close race. \n                  In the August election, Edward D. Baker had won election in the Sixth Congressional\n                  District.From December 1848 to February 1849, Lincoln received several letters urging him to\n                  help Turner R. King secure a job at the U.S. General Land Office.  On April 13, 1849,\n                  he wrote anotherletterreversing himself, recommending King for the job of receiver.  On May 10, Lincoln\n                  reversed himself again, penning aletterrecommending King for register. In late May, President Zachary Taylor removed Barrett\n                  and King received the appointment as register, holding the job until 1853.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:271; Howard W.
