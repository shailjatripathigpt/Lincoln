        "text": "2This relates to the caseDunlap v. Smith & Dunlap, a case which was brought before theIllinois Supreme Courton appeal of theSangamon County Circuit Court's ruling in the  caseSmith & Dunlap v. Dunlap.The original suit revolved around the issue of a debtJames Dunlapincurred to theBank of Illinois. In February 1843, James Dunlap gave the Bank of Illinois a promissory note for $131,480.52,\n                  to be paid in State ofIllinoisbonds in sixty days.  He defaulted on this debt in April 1843, and the bank went\n                  into bankruptcy.  In April 1845,David A. SmithandGeorge A. Dunlapreceived the promissory note in the form of a stock note, as assignees of the bank.\n                  They sued to collect on the note in December 1850, and, later that month, the Sangamon\n                  County Circuit Court ruled in their favor, awarding $38,361.93.  Unsatisfied with\n                  this amount, Smith, who was an attorney himself, and George Dunlap retained Lincoln\n                  andWilliam H. Herndon, who appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, also in December 1850.  Lincoln argued\n                  that the lower court erred in estimating the damages at $0.20 on the dollar, insisting\n                  that the court should have estimated the damages at $0.30 on the dollar.  In late\n                  December 1850, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected Lincoln's argument and affirmed\n                  the Sangamon County Circuit Court’s judgment.  JusticeSamuel H. Treatstated that James Dunlap was liable “only for [the notes’] real, not their nominal\n                  value,” and that the proper damages consisted of the “difference between the contract\n                  price and the market value of the article when the delivery ought to have been made.”Smith & Dunlap v.

As a result, in June 1851, James Dunlap appealed to the Illinois\n                  Supreme Court.This appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court constituted the caseDunlap v. Smith & Dunlap. Lincoln represented Smith and George Dunlap.Stephen T. Logan,John A. McClernand, andStephen A. Douglasserved as James Dunlap’s attorneys, and JusticesJohn D. Caton,Samuel H. Treat, andLyman Trumbullwere the presiding judges in the case. In the end, in June 1851, the Illinois Supreme\n                  Court reversed and remanded the Sangamon County Circuit Court’s decision to overrule\n                  James Dunlap's motion to allow his payment of $28,127.35 to satisfy the circuit court’s\n                  December 1850 judgment, although Justice Trumbull complained about the impact of an\n                  incomplete record on their decision, writing “It is to be regretted that, in so important\n                  a case as this, the parties have not thought proper to bring before the court the\n                  whole transaction out of which Dunlap's indebtedness arose.”Opinion, Document ID: 96949,Dunlap v.
