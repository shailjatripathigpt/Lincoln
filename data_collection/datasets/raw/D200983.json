        "text": "3Lincoln is referencing the conflict within the Democratic Party over theLecompton Constitution.  During the agitation over whether to admitKansasas a free or slave state, pro-slavery Kansans held a constitutional convention inLecomptonfrom September 7 to November 8, 1857, drafting a constitution guaranteeing slaveholders\n                  already in the territory their property rights and  leaving the decision whether to\n                  allow new slaves into the territory to voters in a referendum.  Voters could vote\n                  for the “constitution with slavery” or the “constitution without slavery,” but were\n                  not offered the opportunity to accept or reject the constitution as a whole.  On December\n                  21, 1857, Kansans voting in the referendum on the Lecompton Constitution--free state\n                  Kansans abstained from participating--cast 6,226 votes for Lecompton with slavery\n                  and 569 for it without slavery amid charges of voter fraud.   On January 4, 1858,\n                  however, Kansans voting in elections called by the anti-slavery legislature--pro-slavery\n                  Kansans abstained from participating-- overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution.\n                  Despite opposition in Kansas and considerable backlash from Republicans and the anti-slavery\n                  faction in the Democratic Party, PresidentJames Buchanansupported the Lecompton Constitution, urging that Kansas be admitted into the Union\n                  under the its terms.Stephen A. Douglasopposed it, however, bringing him into conflict with Buchanan.  Buchanan warned Douglas\n                  that he faced political reprisals if he opposed the administration, but Douglas defied\n                  the president, arguing in a speech before  theU.S. Senatethat the Lecompton Constitution did not reflect the will of the actual inhabitants\n                  of Kansas, citing the December 21, 1857 vote that allowed voters to vote for the constitution\n                  but not against it.  The Senate approved the Lecompton Constitution, but Republicans,\n                  Democratic allies of Douglas, and others, with Douglas as floor leader of the opposition,\n                  defeated it in theU.S. House of Representatives.
