Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B.

        "text": "4Lincoln’s response to this letter, if he wrote one, has not been located. Hall addressed\n                  Lincoln at Washington, DC, because Lincoln had decided to travel to the nation’s capital\n                  to personally lobby for appointment as commissioner.  He left Springfield on June\n                  10 and arrived in Washington on or before June 19.  Ultimately, neither Morrison,\n                  Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment; the job went to Butterfield instead.\n                  See theGeneral Land Office Affair.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 10 June 1849,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1849-06-10; 19 June 1849,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1849-06-19."
