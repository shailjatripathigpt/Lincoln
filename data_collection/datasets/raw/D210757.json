        "text": "2Hill's father has not been identified.In April 1850, Egbert O. Hill was accused of larceny after allegedly stealing a plough\n                  and clevis fromWilliam H. Hodge. He was indicted byIllinoisstate's attorneyDavid B. CampbellinMcLean County Circuit Court. However, Hill defaulted on his recognizance and the case was paused with the possibility\n                  for future reinstatement.On February 16, 1859, Leonard Swett pushed for an amendment to the criminal code in\n                  theIllinois House of Representatives. His proposal, stating that \"all indictments for larceny, where the property stolen\n                  does not exceed twenty dollars in value, shall be barred after seven years from the\n                  time of the finding of the indictment,\" passed. When the case was reinstated, Hill\n                  received a change of venue toMacon County Circuit Courtand retained both Lincoln and Swett as attorneys. Since it had been more than seven\n                  years since the initial accusation, Swett's approved amendment was applicable, and\n                  the court dropped the case in July 1859.JP Transcript, Document ID: 32192,People v.
