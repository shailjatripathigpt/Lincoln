        "text": "2John C. Bagby, aRepublican, was a candidate for theIllinois Senatein the Illinois Eleventh Senate District in the Illinois state elections of 1858.\n                  Lincoln was running as the Republican Party’s candidate againstStephen A. Douglas, the incumbentDemocrat, for theU.S. Senate.    Members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore,\n                  the outcome of Bagby’s election campaign and other the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand Illinois Senate were highly relevant to Lincoln’s candidacy for  U.S. Senate.\n                  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election. John P.Voters in the Illinois Eleventh Senate District, which includedHancock,Henderson, andSchuylercounties, electedJohn P. Richmond, Bagby’sDemocraticopponent, to the seat by a vote of 4,578 to 4,112 votes.In the local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in\n                  the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly.\n                  When the members of the General Assembly voted on who would represent Illinois in\n                  the U.S. Senate, Richmond cast his ballot for Douglas, who ultimately won reelection\n                  to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition and respect within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 556-57; Allen C.

Judd,  organized and financially supported Republican candidates in races at all levels\n                  across Illinois in 1858.  The committee, however, struggled with funding in 1858,\n                  running up huge debts that forced Judd to beg Lincoln and others for contributions\n                  to discharge the debt.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:552; Harry E.
