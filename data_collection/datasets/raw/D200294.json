Although the Temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty years, it is apparent\n               to all, that it is,just now, being crowned with a degree of success, hitherto unparalelled. The list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of hundreds,\n               and of thousands.  The cause itself seems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract\n               theory, to a living. breathing, active, and powerful chieftain, going forth “conquering and to conquer.”2The citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his\n               temples and his altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed,\n               and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made, are daily desecrated and\n               deserted.  The trump of the conqueror’s fame is sounding from hill to hill, from sea\n               to sea, and from land to land, and calling millions to his standard at a blast. For this new and splendid success, we heartily rejoice.  That that success is so much\n               greaternowthanheretofore, is doubtless owing to rational causes; and if we would have it to continue, we shall\n               do well to enquire what those causes are.  The warfare heretofore waged against the\n               demen of Intemperance, has, some how or other, been erroneous.    Either the champions\n               engaged, or the tactics they adopted, have not been the most proper.  These champions\n               for the most part, have been Preachers, Lawyers, and hired agents.—Between these and\n               the mass of mankind, there is a want ofapproachability, if the term be admissible, partially at least, fatal to their success. They are\n               supposed to have no sympathy of feeling or interest, with those very persons whom\n               it is their object to convince and persuade. And again, it is so easy and so common to ascribe motives to men of these classes,\n               other than those they profess to act upon.  Thepreacher, it is said, advocates temperance because he is a fanatic, and desires a union of\n               Church and State; thelawyer, from his pride and vanity of hearing himself speak; and thehired agent, for his salary.  But when one, who has long been known as a victim of intemperance,\n               bursts the fetters that have bound him, and appears before his neighbors “clothed, and in his right mind,”3a redeemed specimen of long lost humanity, and stands up with tears of joy trembling\n               in eyes, to tell of the miseriesonceendured,nowto be endured no more forever; of his once naked and starving children, now clad\n               and fed comfortably; of a wife, long weighed down with woe, weeping, and a broken\n               heart, now restored to health, happiness, and renewed affection; and how easily it\n               all is done, once it is resolved to be done; however simple his language, there is\n               a logic, and an eloquence in it, that few, with human feelings, can resist.  They\n               cannot say thathedesires a union of church and state, for he is not a church member; they can not\n               sayheis vain of hearing himself speak, for his whole demeanor shows, he would gladly avoid[speaking at all; they cannot sayhe]4speaks for pay for he receives none, and asks for none.  Nor can his sincerity in\n               any way be doubted; or his sympathy for those he would persuade to immitate his example, be denied. In my judgment, it is to the battles of this new class of champions that our late\n               success is greatly, perhaps chifly, owing.—But, had the old school champions themselves, been of the most wise selecting,\n               was theirsystemof tactics, the most judicious? It seems to me, it was not.  Too much denunciation\n               against dram sellers and dram-drinkers was indulged in.  This, I think, was both impolitic\n               and unjust.  It wasimpolitic, because, it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to any thing; still less\n               to be driven about that which is exclusively his own business; and least of all, where\n               such driving is to be submitted to, at the expense of pecuniary interest, or burning\n               appetite.  When the dram-seller and drinker, were incessantly told, not in the accents\n               of entreaty and persuasion, diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring brother;\n               but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation, with which the lordly Judge\n               often groups together all the crimes of the felon’s life, and thrusts them in his\n               face just ere he passes sentence of death upon him, thattheywere the authors of all the vice and misery and crime in the land; thattheywere the manufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers and murderers\n               that infested the earth; thattheirhouses were the workshops of the devil; and thattheir personsshould be shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral pestilences—I say, when\n               they were told all this, and in this way, it is not wonderful that they were slow,very slow, to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations, and to join the ranks of their denouncers,\n               in a hue and cry against themselves. To have expected them to do otherwise than as they did—to have expected them not to\n               meet denunciation with denunciation, crimination with crimination, and anathema with\n               anathema, was to expect a reversal of human nature, which is God’s decree, and never\n               can be reversed.  When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced,persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted.  It is an old and a true maxim,\n               that “a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”—So with men.  If\n               you would win a man to your cause,firstconvince him that your are his sincere friend.    Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which,\n               say what he will, is the great high road to his reason, and which, when once gained,\n               you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your\n               cause, if indeed that cause really be a just one.  On the contrary, assume to dictate\n               to his judgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned and\n               despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues to his head and\n               his heart; and tho’[though] your cause be naked truth itself, transformed to the heaviest lance, harder than\n               steel, and sharper than steel can be made, and tho’ you throw it with more than Herculean force and precision, you shall no more be able\n               to pierce him, than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw. Such is man, and somusthe be understood by those who would lead him, even to his own best interest. On this point, theWashingtoniansgreatly excel the temperance advocates of former times.  Those whomtheydesire to convince and persuade, are their old friends and companions.  They know\n               they are no demons, nor even the worst of men.Theyknow that generally, they are kind, generous and charitable, even beyond the example\n               of their more staid and sober neighbors.Theyare practical philanthropists; andtheyglow with a generous and brotherly zeal, that mere theorizers are incapable of feeling.—Benevolence\n               and charity possesstheirhearts entirely; and out of the abundance of their hearts, thelr tongues give utterance. “Love through all their actions run, and all their words are mild.”5In this spirit they speak and act, and in the same, they are heard and regarded.\n               And when such is the temper of the advocate, and such of the audience, no good cause\n               can be unsuccessful. But I have said that denunciations against dram-sellers and dram-drinkers, areunjustas well as impolitic.  Let us see. I have not enquired at what period of time the use of intoxicating drinks commenced;\n               nor is it important to know.  It is sufficient that to all of us who now inhabit the\n               world, the practice of drinking them, is just as old as the world itself,—that is,\n               we have seen the one, just as long as we have seen the other.  When all such of us,\n               as have now reached the years of maturity, first opened our eyes upon the stage of\n               existence, we found intoxicating liquor, recognized by every body, used by every body,\n               and repudiated by nobody.  It commonly entered into the first draught of the infant,\n               and the last draught of the dying man.  From the sideboard of the parson, down to\n               the ragged pocket of the houseless loafer, it was constantly found.  Physicians prescribed\n               it in this, that, and the other disease.  Government provided it for its soldiers\n               and sailors; and to have a rolling or raising, a husking or hoe-down, any where without\n               it, waspositively insufferable. So too, it was every where a respectable article of manufacture and of merchandize.  The making of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood; and he who could make\n               most, was the most enterprising and respectable.  Large and small manufactories of\n               it were every where erected, in which all the earthly goods of their owners were invested.\n               Wagons drew it from town to town—boats bore it from clime to clime, and the winds\n               wafted it from nation to nation; and merchants bought and sold it, by wholesale and\n               by retail, with pre[c]i[s]ely the same feelings, on the part of the seller, buyer, and by-stander, as are felt at the selling and buying of flour, beef, bacon, or any other of the\n               real necessaries of life.  Universal  public opinion not only tolerated, but recognized\n               and adopted its use. It is true, that eventhen, it was known and acknowledged, that many were greatly injured by it; but none seemed\n               to think the injury arose from theuseof abad thing, but from theabuseof avery good thing.—The victims to it were pitied, and compassionated, just as now are, the heirs of\n               consumptions, and other hereditary diseases.  Their failing was treated as amisfortune, and not as acrime, or even as adisgrace. If, then, what I have been saying be true, is it wonderful, thatsomeshould think and actnow, asallthought and actedtwenty years ago? And is itjustto assail, contemn, or despise them, for doing so? The universalsenseof mankind, on any subject, is an argument, or at least aninfluencenot easily overcome.[The success of the argu]ment6in favor of the existence of an overruling Providence, mainly depends upon that sense;\n               and men ought not, in justice, to be denonnced for yielding to it, in any case, or for giving it up slowly,especially, where they are backed by interest, fixed habits, or burning appetites. Another error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was, the position\n               that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and therefore, must be turned\n               adrift, and damned without remedy, in order that the grace of temperance might abound\n               to the temperatethen, and to all mankind some hundred yearsthereafter.—There is in this something so repugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded\n               and feelingless, that it never did, nor ever can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular\n               cause.  We could not love the man who taught it—we could not hear him with patience.\n               The heart could not throw open its portals to it.  The generous man could not adopt\n               it.  It could not mix with his blood.  It looked so fi[e]ndishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers overboard, to lighten the boat\n               for our secur[i]ty—that the noble minded shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing. And besides this, the benefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system, were\n               too remote in point of time, to warmly engage many in its behalf.  Few can be induced\n               to labor exclusively for posterity; and none will do it enthusiastically.  Posterity\n               has done nothing for us; and theorise on it as we may, practically we shall do very little for it, unless we are made to\n               think, we are, at the same time, doing something for ourselves.  What an ignorance\n               of human nature does it exhibit, to ask or expect a whole community to rise up and\n               labor for thetemporalhappiness ofothersafterthemselvesshall be consigned to the dust, a majority of which community take no pains whatever\n               to secure their own eternal w[e]lfare, at a no greater distant day? Great distance, in either time or space, has wonderful\n               power to lull and render quiescent the human mind.  Pleasures to be enjoynd, or pains to be endured,afterwe shall be dead and gone, are but little regarded, even in ourowncases, and much less in the cases of others. Still, in addition to this, there is something so ludicrous inpromisesof good, orthreatsof evil, a great way off, as to render the whole subject with which they are connected,\n               easily turned into ridicule.  “Better lay down that spade you’re stealing, Paddy,—if\n               you don’t you’ll pay for it at the day of judgment.”  “By the powers, if ye’ll credit\n               me so long, I’ll take another, jist.” By the Washingtonians, this system of consigning the habitual drunkard to hopeless\n               ruin, is repudiated.Theyadopt a more enlarged philanthropy.Theygo for present as well as future good.Theylabor for allnowliving, as well as allhereafterto live.—Theyteachhopeto all—dispairto none.  As applying totheircause,theydeny the doctrine of unpardonable sin.  As in christianity it is taught, so in thistheyteach, that “While the lamp holds out to burn, The vilest sinner may return.”7 And, what is matter of the most profound gratulation, they, by experiment upon experiment,\n               and example upon example, prove the maxim to be no less true in the one case than\n               in the other.  On every hand we behold those, who but yesterday, were the chief of\n               sinners, now the chief apostles of the cause.  Drunken devils are cast out by ones,\n               by sevens, and by legions; and their unfortunate victims, like the poor possessed,\n               who was redeemed from his long and lonely wanderings in the tombs, are publishing\n               to the ends of the earth, how great things have been done for them. To thesenew champions, and thisnewsystem of tactics, our late success is mainly owing; and tothemwe must chiefly look for the final consummation.  The ball is now rolling gloriously\n               on, and none are so able astheyto increase its speed, and its bulk—to add to its momentum, and its magnitude.—Even\n               though unlearned in letters, for this task, none others are so well educated.  To\n               fit them for this work, they have been taught in the true school.Theyhave been inthatgulf, from which they would teach others the means of escape.Theyhave passed that prison wall, which others have long declared impassable; and who\n               that has not, shall dare to weigh opinions withthem, as to the mode of passing. But  if it be true, as I have insisted, that those who have suffered by intemperancepersonally, and have reformed, are the most powerful and efficient instruments to push the reformation\n               to ultimate success, it does not follow, that those who have not suffered, have no\n               part left them to perform. Whether or not the world would be vastly benefitted by\n               a total and final banishment from it of all intoxicating drinks, seems to me notnowto be an open question.  Three-fourths of mankind confess the affirmative with theirtongues, and, I believe, all the rest acknowledge it in theirhearts. Oughtany, then, to refuse their aid in doing what the good of thewholedemands?—Shall he, who cannot domuch, be, for that reason, excused if he donothing?  “But,” says one, “what good can I do by signing the pledge? I never drink even\n               without signing.” This question has already been asked and answered more than millions\n               of times.  Let it be answered once more.  For the m[a]n to suddenly, or in any other way, to break off from the use of drams, who has indulged\n               in them for a long course of years, and until his appetite for them has become ten\n               or a hundred fold stronger, and more craving, than any natural appetite can be, requires\n               a most powerful moral effort.  In such an undertaking, he needs every moral support\n               and influence, that can possibly be brought to his aid, and thrown around him.  And\n               not only so; but every moral prop, should be takenfromwhatever argument might rise in his mind to lure him to his backsliding.  When he\n               casts his eyes around him, he should be able to see, all that he respects, all that\n               he admires, and all that loves, kindly and anxiously pointing him onward; and none\n               beckoning him back, to his former miserable “wallowing in the mire.”8 But it is said by some, that men willthinkandactfor themselves; that none will disuse spirits or any thing else, merely because his\n               neighbors do; and thatmoral influenceis not that powerful engine contended for.  Let us examine this.  Let me ask the\n               man who would maintain this position most stiffly, what compensation he will accept\n               to go to church some Sunday and sit during the sermon with his wife’s bonnet upon\n               his head?  Not a trifle, I’d venture.  And why not? There would be nothing irreligious\n               in it: nothing immoral, nothing uncomfortable.—Then why not? Is it not because there\n               would be something egregiously unfashionable in it?  Then it is the influence offashion; and what is the influence of fashion, but the influence thatotherpeople’s[actions have]. . .,9the strong inclination each of us feels to do as we see all our neighbors do? Nor\n               is the influence of fashion confined to any particular thing or class of things. \n               It is just as strong on one subject as another.  Let us make it as unfashionable to\n               withhold our names from the temperance pledge as for husbands to wear their wives\n               bonnets to church, and instanc[es]will be just as rare in one case as the other. “But,” say some, “we are no drunkards; and we shall not acknowledge ourselves such\n               by joining a reformed drunkard’s society, whatever our influence might be.” Surely\n               no christian will adhere to this objection.—If they believe, as they profess, that\n               Omnipotence condescended to take on himself the form of sinful man, and, as such,\n               to die an ignominious death for their sakes, surely they will not refuse submission\n               to the infinitely lesser condescension, for the temporal, and perhaps eternal salvation,\n               of a large, erring, and unfortunate class of their own fellow creatures.  Nor is the\n               condoscension very great. In my judgment, such of us as have never fallen victims, have been spared more from\n               the absence of appetite, than from any mental or moral superiority over those who\n               have.  Indeed, I believe, if we take habitual drunkards as a class, their heads and\n               their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class. \n               There seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant, and the warm-blooded,\n               to fall into this vice—The demon of intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking\n               the blood of genius and of generosity.  What one of us but can call to mind some dear\n               relative, more promising in youth than all his fellows, who has fallen a sacrifice\n               to his rapacity?  He ever seems to have gone forth, like the Egyptian angel of death,\n               commissioned to slay if not the first, the fairest born of every family[.]Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?  In that arrest, all can give\n               aid that will; and who shall be excused thatcan, and will not? Far around as human breath has ever blown, he keeps our fathers, our\n               brothers, our sons, and our friends, prostrate in the chains of moral death.  To all\n               the living every where, we cry, “come sound the moral resurrection trump, that these may rise and stand up, an exceeding\n                  great army”— “Come from the four winds, O breath! and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.”10 If the relative grandeur of revolutions shall be estimated by the great amount of\n               human misery they aileviate, and the small amount they inflict, then, indeed, will this be the grandest the world\n               shall ever have seen.—Of ourpolitical revolution of ‘76, we all are justly proud.  It has given us a degree of political freedom, far exceeding\n               that of any other of the nations of the earth.  In it th[e]world has found a solution of that long mooted problem, as to the capability of man\n               to govern himself.  In it was the germ which has vegetated, and still is to grow and\n               expand into the universal liberty of mankind. But with all these glorious results, past, present, and to come, it had its evils\n               too.—It breathed forth famine, swam in blood and rode on fire; and long, long after,\n               the orphan’s cry, and the widow’s wail, continued to break the sad silence that ensued.\n               These were the price, the inevitable price, paid for the blessings it bought. Turn now, to the temperance revolution.  Init, we shall find a stronger bondage broken; a viler slavery, manumitted; a greater\n               tyrant deposed.  Init, more of want supplied, more disease healed, more sorrow assuaged. Byitno orphans starving, no widows  weeping.  Byit, none wounded in feeling, none injured in interest.  Even the dram-maker, and dram\n               seller, will have glided into other occupationssogradually, as never to have felt the shock of change; and will stand ready to join\n               all others in the universal song of gladness. And what a noble ally this, to the cause of political freedom.  With such an aid,\n               its march cannot fail to be on and on, till every son of earth shall drink in rich\n               fruition, the sorrow quenching draughts of perfect liberty.  Happy day, when, all\n               appetites controled, all passions subdued, all matters subjected,mind, all conqueringmind, shall live and move the monarch of the world.  Glorious consummation! Hail fall\n               of Fury! Reign of Reason, all hail! And when the victory shall be complete—when there shall be neither a slave nor a drunkard\n               on the earth—how proud the title of thatLand, which may truly claim to be the birth-place and the cradle of both those revolutions,\n               that shall have ended in that victory.  How nobly distinguished that People, who shall\n               have planted, and nurtured to maturity, both the political and moral freedom of their\n               species. This is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birth-day ofWashington.—We are met to celebrate this day.  Washington is the migh[t]iest name of earth—long sincemightiest in the cause of civil liberty;stillmightiest in moral reformation.  On that name, an eulogy is expected.

      "AN ADDRESS,Delivered before theSpringfield Washington Temperance Society, on the 22d February, 1842—BYABRAHAM LINCOLN, ESQ.,And published by direction of the Society.",
      "Although the Temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty years, it is apparent\n               to all, that it is,just now, being crowned with a degree of success, hitherto unparalelled.",
      "The list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of hundreds,\n               and of thousands.  The cause itself seems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract\n               theory, to a living. breathing, active, and powerful chieftain, going forth “conquering and to conquer.”2The citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his\n               temples and his altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed,\n               and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made, are daily desecrated and\n               deserted.  The trump of the conqueror’s fame is sounding from hill to hill, from sea\n               to sea, and from land to land, and calling millions to his standard at a blast.",
      "For this new and splendid success, we heartily rejoice.  That that success is so much\n               greaternowthanheretofore, is doubtless owing to rational causes; and if we would have it to continue, we shall\n               do well to enquire what those causes are.  The warfare heretofore waged against the\n               demen of Intemperance, has, some how or other, been erroneous.    Either the champions\n               engaged, or the tactics they adopted, have not been the most proper.  These champions\n               for the most part, have been Preachers, Lawyers, and hired agents.—Between these and\n               the mass of mankind, there is a want ofapproachability, if the term be admissible, partially at least, fatal to their success. They are\n               supposed to have no sympathy of feeling or interest, with those very persons whom\n               it is their object to convince and persuade.",
      "And again, it is so easy and so common to ascribe motives to men of these classes,\n               other than those they profess to act upon.  Thepreacher, it is said, advocates temperance because he is a fanatic, and desires a union of\n               Church and State; thelawyer, from his pride and vanity of hearing himself speak; and thehired agent, for his salary.  But when one, who has long been known as a victim of intemperance,\n               bursts the fetters that have bound him, and appears before his neighbors “clothed, and in his right mind,”3a redeemed specimen of long lost humanity, and stands up with tears of joy trembling\n               in eyes, to tell of the miseriesonceendured,nowto be endured no more forever; of his once naked and starving children, now clad\n               and fed comfortably; of a wife, long weighed down with woe, weeping, and a broken\n               heart, now restored to health, happiness, and renewed affection; and how easily it\n               all is done, once it is resolved to be done; however simple his language, there is\n               a logic, and an eloquence in it, that few, with human feelings, can resist.  They\n               cannot say thathedesires a union of church and state, for he is not a church member; they can not\n               sayheis vain of hearing himself speak, for his whole demeanor shows, he would gladly avoid[speaking at all; they cannot sayhe]4speaks for pay for he receives none, and asks for none.  Nor can his sincerity in\n               any way be doubted; or his sympathy for those he would persuade to immitate his example, be denied.",
      "In my judgment, it is to the battles of this new class of champions that our late\n               success is greatly, perhaps chifly, owing.—But, had the old school champions themselves, been of the most wise selecting,\n               was theirsystemof tactics, the most judicious? It seems to me, it was not.  Too much denunciation\n               against dram sellers and dram-drinkers was indulged in.  This, I think, was both impolitic\n               and unjust.  It wasimpolitic, because, it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to any thing; still less\n               to be driven about that which is exclusively his own business; and least of all, where\n               such driving is to be submitted to, at the expense of pecuniary interest, or burning\n               appetite.  When the dram-seller and drinker, were incessantly told, not in the accents\n               of entreaty and persuasion, diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring brother;\n               but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation, with which the lordly Judge\n               often groups together all the crimes of the felon’s life, and thrusts them in his\n               face just ere he passes sentence of death upon him, thattheywere the authors of all the vice and misery and crime in the land; thattheywere the manufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers and murderers\n               that infested the earth; thattheirhouses were the workshops of the devil; and thattheir personsshould be shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral pestilences—I say, when\n               they were told all this, and in this way, it is not wonderful that they were slow,very slow, to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations, and to join the ranks of their denouncers,\n               in a hue and cry against themselves.",
      "To have expected them to do otherwise than as they did—to have expected them not to\n               meet denunciation with denunciation, crimination with crimination, and anathema with\n               anathema, was to expect a reversal of human nature, which is God’s decree, and never\n               can be reversed.  When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced,persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted.  It is an old and a true maxim,\n               that “a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”—So with men.  If\n               you would win a man to your cause,firstconvince him that your are his sincere friend.    Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which,\n               say what he will, is the great high road to his reason, and which, when once gained,\n               you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your\n               cause, if indeed that cause really be a just one.  On the contrary, assume to dictate\n               to his judgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned and\n               despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues to his head and\n               his heart; and tho’[though] your cause be naked truth itself, transformed to the heaviest lance, harder than\n               steel, and sharper than steel can be made, and tho’ you throw it with more than Herculean force and precision, you shall no more be able\n               to pierce him, than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw.",
      "Such is man, and somusthe be understood by those who would lead him, even to his own best interest.",
      "On this point, theWashingtoniansgreatly excel the temperance advocates of former times.  Those whomtheydesire to convince and persuade, are their old friends and companions.  They know\n               they are no demons, nor even the worst of men.Theyknow that generally, they are kind, generous and charitable, even beyond the example\n               of their more staid and sober neighbors.Theyare practical philanthropists; andtheyglow with a generous and brotherly zeal, that mere theorizers are incapable of feeling.—Benevolence\n               and charity possesstheirhearts entirely; and out of the abundance of their hearts, thelr tongues give utterance. “Love through all their actions run, and all their words are mild.”5In this spirit they speak and act, and in the same, they are heard and regarded.\n               And when such is the temper of the advocate, and such of the audience, no good cause\n               can be unsuccessful.",
      "But I have said that denunciations against dram-sellers and dram-drinkers, areunjustas well as impolitic.  Let us see.",
      "I have not enquired at what period of time the use of intoxicating drinks commenced;\n               nor is it important to know.  It is sufficient that to all of us who now inhabit the\n               world, the practice of drinking them, is just as old as the world itself,—that is,\n               we have seen the one, just as long as we have seen the other.  When all such of us,\n               as have now reached the years of maturity, first opened our eyes upon the stage of\n               existence, we found intoxicating liquor, recognized by every body, used by every body,\n               and repudiated by nobody.  It commonly entered into the first draught of the infant,\n               and the last draught of the dying man.  From the sideboard of the parson, down to\n               the ragged pocket of the houseless loafer, it was constantly found.  Physicians prescribed\n               it in this, that, and the other disease.  Government provided it for its soldiers\n               and sailors; and to have a rolling or raising, a husking or hoe-down, any where without\n               it, waspositively insufferable.",
      "So too, it was every where a respectable article of manufacture and of merchandize.  The making of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood; and he who could make\n               most, was the most enterprising and respectable.  Large and small manufactories of\n               it were every where erected, in which all the earthly goods of their owners were invested.\n               Wagons drew it from town to town—boats bore it from clime to clime, and the winds\n               wafted it from nation to nation; and merchants bought and sold it, by wholesale and\n               by retail, with pre[c]i[s]ely the same feelings, on the part of the seller, buyer, and by-stander, as are felt at the selling and buying of flour, beef, bacon, or any other of the\n               real necessaries of life.  Universal  public opinion not only tolerated, but recognized\n               and adopted its use.",
      "It is true, that eventhen, it was known and acknowledged, that many were greatly injured by it; but none seemed\n               to think the injury arose from theuseof abad thing, but from theabuseof avery good thing.—The victims to it were pitied, and compassionated, just as now are, the heirs of\n               consumptions, and other hereditary diseases.  Their failing was treated as amisfortune, and not as acrime, or even as adisgrace.",
      "If, then, what I have been saying be true, is it wonderful, thatsomeshould think and actnow, asallthought and actedtwenty years ago? And is itjustto assail, contemn, or despise them, for doing so? The universalsenseof mankind, on any subject, is an argument, or at least aninfluencenot easily overcome.[The success of the argu]ment6in favor of the existence of an overruling Providence, mainly depends upon that sense;\n               and men ought not, in justice, to be denonnced for yielding to it, in any case, or for giving it up slowly,especially, where they are backed by interest, fixed habits, or burning appetites.",
      "Another error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was, the position\n               that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and therefore, must be turned\n               adrift, and damned without remedy, in order that the grace of temperance might abound\n               to the temperatethen, and to all mankind some hundred yearsthereafter.—There is in this something so repugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded\n               and feelingless, that it never did, nor ever can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular\n               cause.  We could not love the man who taught it—we could not hear him with patience.\n               The heart could not throw open its portals to it.  The generous man could not adopt\n               it.  It could not mix with his blood.  It looked so fi[e]ndishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers overboard, to lighten the boat\n               for our secur[i]ty—that the noble minded shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing.",
      "And besides this, the benefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system, were\n               too remote in point of time, to warmly engage many in its behalf.  Few can be induced\n               to labor exclusively for posterity; and none will do it enthusiastically.  Posterity\n               has done nothing for us; and theorise on it as we may, practically we shall do very little for it, unless we are made to\n               think, we are, at the same time, doing something for ourselves.  What an ignorance\n               of human nature does it exhibit, to ask or expect a whole community to rise up and\n               labor for thetemporalhappiness ofothersafterthemselvesshall be consigned to the dust, a majority of which community take no pains whatever\n               to secure their own eternal w[e]lfare, at a no greater distant day? Great distance, in either time or space, has wonderful\n               power to lull and render quiescent the human mind.  Pleasures to be enjoynd, or pains to be endured,afterwe shall be dead and gone, are but little regarded, even in ourowncases, and much less in the cases of others.",
      "Still, in addition to this, there is something so ludicrous inpromisesof good, orthreatsof evil, a great way off, as to render the whole subject with which they are connected,\n               easily turned into ridicule.  “Better lay down that spade you’re stealing, Paddy,—if\n               you don’t you’ll pay for it at the day of judgment.”  “By the powers, if ye’ll credit\n               me so long, I’ll take another, jist.”",
      "By the Washingtonians, this system of consigning the habitual drunkard to hopeless\n               ruin, is repudiated.Theyadopt a more enlarged philanthropy.Theygo for present as well as future good.Theylabor for allnowliving, as well as allhereafterto live.—Theyteachhopeto all—dispairto none.  As applying totheircause,theydeny the doctrine of unpardonable sin.  As in christianity it is taught, so in thistheyteach, that",
      "“While the lamp holds out to burn,",
      "The vilest sinner may return.”7",
      "And, what is matter of the most profound gratulation, they, by experiment upon experiment,\n               and example upon example, prove the maxim to be no less true in the one case than\n               in the other.  On every hand we behold those, who but yesterday, were the chief of\n               sinners, now the chief apostles of the cause.  Drunken devils are cast out by ones,\n               by sevens, and by legions; and their unfortunate victims, like the poor possessed,\n               who was redeemed from his long and lonely wanderings in the tombs, are publishing\n               to the ends of the earth, how great things have been done for them.",
      "To thesenew champions, and thisnewsystem of tactics, our late success is mainly owing; and tothemwe must chiefly look for the final consummation.  The ball is now rolling gloriously\n               on, and none are so able astheyto increase its speed, and its bulk—to add to its momentum, and its magnitude.—Even\n               though unlearned in letters, for this task, none others are so well educated.  To\n               fit them for this work, they have been taught in the true school.Theyhave been inthatgulf, from which they would teach others the means of escape.Theyhave passed that prison wall, which others have long declared impassable; and who\n               that has not, shall dare to weigh opinions withthem, as to the mode of passing.",
      "But  if it be true, as I have insisted, that those who have suffered by intemperancepersonally, and have reformed, are the most powerful and efficient instruments to push the reformation\n               to ultimate success, it does not follow, that those who have not suffered, have no\n               part left them to perform. Whether or not the world would be vastly benefitted by\n               a total and final banishment from it of all intoxicating drinks, seems to me notnowto be an open question.  Three-fourths of mankind confess the affirmative with theirtongues, and, I believe, all the rest acknowledge it in theirhearts.",
      "Oughtany, then, to refuse their aid in doing what the good of thewholedemands?—Shall he, who cannot domuch, be, for that reason, excused if he donothing?  “But,” says one, “what good can I do by signing the pledge? I never drink even\n               without signing.” This question has already been asked and answered more than millions\n               of times.  Let it be answered once more.  For the m[a]n to suddenly, or in any other way, to break off from the use of drams, who has indulged\n               in them for a long course of years, and until his appetite for them has become ten\n               or a hundred fold stronger, and more craving, than any natural appetite can be, requires\n               a most powerful moral effort.  In such an undertaking, he needs every moral support\n               and influence, that can possibly be brought to his aid, and thrown around him.  And\n               not only so; but every moral prop, should be takenfromwhatever argument might rise in his mind to lure him to his backsliding.  When he\n               casts his eyes around him, he should be able to see, all that he respects, all that\n               he admires, and all that loves, kindly and anxiously pointing him onward; and none\n               beckoning him back, to his former miserable “wallowing in the mire.”8",
      "But it is said by some, that men willthinkandactfor themselves; that none will disuse spirits or any thing else, merely because his\n               neighbors do; and thatmoral influenceis not that powerful engine contended for.  Let us examine this.  Let me ask the\n               man who would maintain this position most stiffly, what compensation he will accept\n               to go to church some Sunday and sit during the sermon with his wife’s bonnet upon\n               his head?  Not a trifle, I’d venture.  And why not? There would be nothing irreligious\n               in it: nothing immoral, nothing uncomfortable.—Then why not? Is it not because there\n               would be something egregiously unfashionable in it?  Then it is the influence offashion; and what is the influence of fashion, but the influence thatotherpeople’s[actions have]. . .,9the strong inclination each of us feels to do as we see all our neighbors do? Nor\n               is the influence of fashion confined to any particular thing or class of things. \n               It is just as strong on one subject as another.  Let us make it as unfashionable to\n               withhold our names from the temperance pledge as for husbands to wear their wives\n               bonnets to church, and instanc[es]will be just as rare in one case as the other.",
      "“But,” say some, “we are no drunkards; and we shall not acknowledge ourselves such\n               by joining a reformed drunkard’s society, whatever our influence might be.” Surely\n               no christian will adhere to this objection.—If they believe, as they profess, that\n               Omnipotence condescended to take on himself the form of sinful man, and, as such,\n               to die an ignominious death for their sakes, surely they will not refuse submission\n               to the infinitely lesser condescension, for the temporal, and perhaps eternal salvation,\n               of a large, erring, and unfortunate class of their own fellow creatures.  Nor is the\n               condoscension very great.",
      "In my judgment, such of us as have never fallen victims, have been spared more from\n               the absence of appetite, than from any mental or moral superiority over those who\n               have.  Indeed, I believe, if we take habitual drunkards as a class, their heads and\n               their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class. \n               There seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant, and the warm-blooded,\n               to fall into this vice—The demon of intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking\n               the blood of genius and of generosity.  What one of us but can call to mind some dear\n               relative, more promising in youth than all his fellows, who has fallen a sacrifice\n               to his rapacity?  He ever seems to have gone forth, like the Egyptian angel of death,\n               commissioned to slay if not the first, the fairest born of every family[.]Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?  In that arrest, all can give\n               aid that will; and who shall be excused thatcan, and will not? Far around as human breath has ever blown, he keeps our fathers, our\n               brothers, our sons, and our friends, prostrate in the chains of moral death.  To all\n               the living every where, we cry, “come sound the moral resurrection trump, that these may rise and stand up, an exceeding\n                  great army”— “Come from the four winds, O breath! and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.”10",
      "If the relative grandeur of revolutions shall be estimated by the great amount of\n               human misery they aileviate, and the small amount they inflict, then, indeed, will this be the grandest the world\n               shall ever have seen.—Of ourpolitical revolution of ‘76, we all are justly proud.  It has given us a degree of political freedom, far exceeding\n               that of any other of the nations of the earth.  In it th[e]world has found a solution of that long mooted problem, as to the capability of man\n               to govern himself.  In it was the germ which has vegetated, and still is to grow and\n               expand into the universal liberty of mankind.",
      "But with all these glorious results, past, present, and to come, it had its evils\n               too.—It breathed forth famine, swam in blood and rode on fire; and long, long after,\n               the orphan’s cry, and the widow’s wail, continued to break the sad silence that ensued.\n               These were the price, the inevitable price, paid for the blessings it bought.",
      "Turn now, to the temperance revolution.  Init, we shall find a stronger bondage broken; a viler slavery, manumitted; a greater\n               tyrant deposed.  Init, more of want supplied, more disease healed, more sorrow assuaged. Byitno orphans starving, no widows  weeping.  Byit, none wounded in feeling, none injured in interest.  Even the dram-maker, and dram\n               seller, will have glided into other occupationssogradually, as never to have felt the shock of change; and will stand ready to join\n               all others in the universal song of gladness.",
      "And what a noble ally this, to the cause of political freedom.  With such an aid,\n               its march cannot fail to be on and on, till every son of earth shall drink in rich\n               fruition, the sorrow quenching draughts of perfect liberty.  Happy day, when, all\n               appetites controled, all passions subdued, all matters subjected,mind, all conqueringmind, shall live and move the monarch of the world.  Glorious consummation! Hail fall\n               of Fury! Reign of Reason, all hail!",
      "And when the victory shall be complete—when there shall be neither a slave nor a drunkard\n               on the earth—how proud the title of thatLand, which may truly claim to be the birth-place and the cradle of both those revolutions,\n               that shall have ended in that victory.  How nobly distinguished that People, who shall\n               have planted, and nurtured to maturity, both the political and moral freedom of their\n               species.",
      "This is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birth-day ofWashington.—We are met to celebrate this day.  Washington is the migh[t]iest name of earth—long sincemightiest in the cause of civil liberty;stillmightiest in moral reformation.  On that name, an eulogy is expected.  It cannot\n               be.  To add brightness to the sun, or glory to the name of Washington, is alike impossible.\n               Let none attempt it.  In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked deathless\n               splendor, leave it shining on."

The warfare heretofore waged against the\n               demen of Intemperance, has, some how or other, been erroneous.    Either the champions\n               engaged, or the tactics they adopted, have not been the most proper.  These champions\n               for the most part, have been Preachers, Lawyers, and hired agents.—Between these and\n               the mass of mankind, there is a want ofapproachability, if the term be admissible, partially at least, fatal to their success.

But when one, who has long been known as a victim of intemperance,\n               bursts the fetters that have bound him, and appears before his neighbors “clothed, and in his right mind,”3a redeemed specimen of long lost humanity, and stands up with tears of joy trembling\n               in eyes, to tell of the miseriesonceendured,nowto be endured no more forever; of his once naked and starving children, now clad\n               and fed comfortably; of a wife, long weighed down with woe, weeping, and a broken\n               heart, now restored to health, happiness, and renewed affection; and how easily it\n               all is done, once it is resolved to be done; however simple his language, there is\n               a logic, and an eloquence in it, that few, with human feelings, can resist.

It seems to me, it was not.  Too much denunciation\n               against dram sellers and dram-drinkers was indulged in.  This, I think, was both impolitic\n               and unjust.  It wasimpolitic, because, it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to any thing; still less\n               to be driven about that which is exclusively his own business; and least of all, where\n               such driving is to be submitted to, at the expense of pecuniary interest, or burning\n               appetite.  When the dram-seller and drinker, were incessantly told, not in the accents\n               of entreaty and persuasion, diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring brother;\n               but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation, with which the lordly Judge\n               often groups together all the crimes of the felon’s life, and thrusts them in his\n               face just ere he passes sentence of death upon him, thattheywere the authors of all the vice and misery and crime in the land; thattheywere the manufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers and murderers\n               that infested the earth; thattheirhouses were the workshops of the devil; and thattheir personsshould be shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral pestilences—I say, when\n               they were told all this, and in this way, it is not wonderful that they were slow,very slow, to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations, and to join the ranks of their denouncers,\n               in a hue and cry against themselves."

Whether or not the world would be vastly benefitted by\n               a total and final banishment from it of all intoxicating drinks, seems to me notnowto be an open question.  Three-fourths of mankind confess the affirmative with theirtongues, and, I believe, all the rest acknowledge it in theirhearts."
