Both Lincoln and Douglas were highly attuned to the state legislative races in 1858\n                  because members of the Illinois General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore the outcome of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the U.S. Senate race.

In December 1857, Douglas publicly condemned the constitution, causing a major schism\n                  in the Democratic Party. Many Republicans admired Douglas’s repudiation of the Lecompton\n                  Constitution, and of PresidentJames Buchananfor supporting the constitution. For a time, Douglas attempted to take advantage\n                  of this admiration by courting political support from Republicans.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:445-48."

He won 57.7 percent of\n                  the vote, compared to pro-Douglas Democratic candidate George W. Armstrong’s 38.8 percent, and pro-Buchanan Democratic candidate David Le Roy’s 3.4 percent.In the local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in\n                  the state. Iroquois County and Kankakee County were both in the Sixth Illinois Senate\n                  District and Forty-Fifth Illinois House District. Incumbent RepublicanGavion D. A.

Hood to the Illinois House. Parks, Norton, Mack, and Hood each cast their\n                  ballots for Lincoln in the contest for the U.S. Senate. Nevertheless, because  pro-Douglas\n                  Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly, Douglas won reelection\n                  to the U.S. Senate.
