        "text": "2Lincoln references lawsuits againstJames A. Barret,Joseph Klein, Sr., andJohn M. Burkhardton behalf of the directors of the  Alton and Sangamon Railroad Company, which had\n                  retainedLincoln & Herndonto collect balances due on shares of capital stock purchased by stockholders.TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in February 1847 to construct and operate a railroad betweenAlton, Illinois, viaNew Berlin, andSpringfield, Illinois.  Section two  of the company’s charter allowed the incorporators to issue $500,000\n                  in stock at $100 per share, and section six required subscribers to purchase stock\n                  by paying $5 on each share subscribed at the time of subscribing and the balance in\n                  installments called for by a board of directors. The incorporators opened subscription\n                  for stock in May 1847.  Many stock subscribers owned property near the proposed route.\n                  On January 29, 1851, however, the General Assembly altered the charter to allow the\n                  company to construct the road on a more direct route, bypassing the property of several\n                  stockholders.  Believing that the change in route voided their subscription agreements,\n                  several investors refused to pay their remaining installments, and the company  hired\n                  Lincoln & Herndon to collect the full subscriptions.  Barret, Klein, Burkhardt, and\n                  several of the delinquent subscribers were fromSangamon County, Illinois, and thirty-seven were fromMadison County, Illinois.  William Martin was among the incorporators. Lincoln wrote three letters to Martin\n                  prior to this letter, each regarding these suits.Lincoln originally planned to also bring suit againstThomas J.  Kirkpatrick, but in aletterto  Martin on February 19, Lincoln wrote that Kirkpatrick had paid his installments,\n                  and the railroad dismissed its case against him.  Lincoln continued to work on the\n                  three other lawsuits.  In addition to the letter on February 19, Lincoln wrote two\n                  other letters to Martin prior to this letter to Isaac Gibson,oneon February 21 andoneon February 24.  In his letters of February 19 and 21, Lincoln requested the name\n                  of either the clerk or secretary of the railroad.  Martin responded on the February\n                  21.  Martin’s letter has not been located, and its contents remain unknown, but he\n                  probably provided Lincoln with the name of Isaac Gibson, the secretary.Abraham Lincoln to William Martin;Abraham Lincoln to William Martin;Abraham Lincoln to William Martin; \"An Act to Construct a Railroad from Alton, in Madison County, to Springfield, in\n                     Sangamon County,\" 27 February 1847,Private and Special Laws of Illinois(1847), 144-49;Alton & Sangamon Railroad Stock Subscription Book; List of Stock Subscriptions, Document ID: 93972,Alton & Sangamon RR v.
