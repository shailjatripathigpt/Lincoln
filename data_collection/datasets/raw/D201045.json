No manuscript\n                  version of this toast in Lincoln’s hand has been located.On Saturday, July 3, 1858, Lincoln and several hundred Springfield residents, including\n                  the Pioneer Fire Company of Springfield, had traveled by train to Jacksonville to\n                  participate in that city’s Fourth of July celebrations. The residents of Springfield\n                  had attempted to plan their own festivities for the day, but arrangements failed to\n                  coalesce. Instead, the citizens of Springfield organized a parade and speeches to\n                  be held on Monday, July 5, with the Union Fire Company of Jacksonville among the groups\n                  invited to march in the parade. Following the parade and festivities, the Pioneer\n                  Fire Company hosted this dinner for the Union Fire Company in response to the hospitality\n                  they had received in Jacksonville two days earlier.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 3 July 1858, 2:1, 3:1; 6 July 1858, 2:1-4; 21 July 1858, 2:4;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 3 July 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-03."
