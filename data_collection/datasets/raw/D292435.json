        "text": "4TheDemocraticDewitt Couriersimilarly described  this August 19, 1856DeWitt CountyRepublican convention at the courthouse in Clinton as “composed of discordant elements\n                  that had no affinity for each other.” This partisan newspaper account of the proceedings\n                  reported disagreement over whether to support Fremont orMillard Fillmorefor president, as well as widely divergent views on slavery amongst attendees. Although\n                  the convention participants successfully nominated candidates for local office, the\n                  article ended with the observation that “Judging from the way things worked in the\n                  Fusion convention, we may safely count upon this county going Democratic by a very\n                  decent majority” in the upcomingelection.  In thepresidential election of 1856, DeWitt County went Democrat, givingJames Buchanan, the Democratic candidate, 40.4 percent of the vote to 37.1 percent for Fremont and\n                  22.5 percent for Fillmore, theAmerican Partycandidate.Dewitt Courier(Clinton, IL), 22 August 1853, 2:3; Franklin William Scott,Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, vol. 6 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1910), 151; Howard W.
