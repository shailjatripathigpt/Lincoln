        "text": "4Hoyt references support for Lincoln’s candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first).  As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S.\n                  Senate seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, including Hoyt, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his\n                  prospects.Alexander C. GibsonwroteLincoln on November 30, discussing the views of the Kane County delegation to Lincoln’s\n                  candidacy.In late-November 1854, Lincolndeclinedto serve in the Illinois General Assembly in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately,\n                  however, he  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the General Assembly selected\n                  anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Adams cast seven ballots for Lincoln before switching his vote to Trumbull.\n                  Hackney shifted his allegiance back and forth from Lincoln toMartin P. SweetandJ. Young Scammonuntil deciding on Trumbull in the ninth ballot.  Patten cast his ballot forWilliam B. Ogden, Sweet, and Trumbull before finally committing to Trumbull in the seventh ballot.\n                  See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73, 185; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.
