        "text": "1This document is entirely inAbraham Lincoln’s handwriting.On December 21, 1848,Daniel Gottintroduced in the House of Representatives a resolution which read as follows: “Whereas\n                  the traffic now prosecuted in this metropolis of the Republic in human beings, as\n                  chattels, is contrary to natural justice and the fundamental principles of our political\n                  system, and is notoriously a reproach to our country throughout Christendom, and a\n                  serious hindrance to the progress of republican liberty among the nations of the earth:\n                  Therefore, Resolved, That the Committee for the District of Columbia be instructed\n                  to report a bill, as soon as practicable, prohibiting the slave trade in said District.”\n                  The House refused to table the resolution by a vote of 81 yeas to 85 nays, with Lincoln\n                  voting yea. The House adopted the resolution by a vote of 98 yeas to 87 or 88 nays,\n                  with Lincoln voting nay (theHouse Journaland theCongressional Globediffer on the nay vote).Charles E. Stuartmoved that the House reconsider this vote, and the House debated this motion continually\n                  over the next few weeks.  On January 10, 1849,John Wentworthmoved to table Stuart’s motion to reconsider.  Lincoln requested that Wentworth withdraw\n                  his motion so he could introduce an amendment to the resolution should the House vote\n                  to reconsider.  Wentworth relented, and Lincoln introduced  this proposed amendment.Cong. Globe, 30th Cong., 2nd Sess., 83-84, 212 (1849); U.S. HouseJournal. 1849. 30th Cong., 2nd sess., 132-33, 134-35."

        "text": "4The House took no action on Lincoln’s amendment.  The House rejected Wentworth’s motion\n                  to table Stuart’s motion to reconsider by a vote of 80 yeas to 120 nays, with Lincoln\n                  voting nay.  The House then agreed to Stuart’s motion to reconsider by a vote of 119\n                  yeas to 81 nays, with Lincoln yea.  On January 13, Lincoln gave notice of his intention\n                  to introduce a bill to abolish slavery in the District, with the consent of the free\n                  white population, and with compensation to the owners.  Lincoln did not introduce\n                  his bill, and the House took no further action on Gott’s resolution, but on January\n                  31, the Committee for the District of Columbia reported abillprohibiting the introduction of slaves into the District.  The House refused to table\n                  the bill by a vote of 72 yeas to 117 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House read\n                  the bill twice and left it on the speaker’s table.The language used in the HouseJournalto describe Lincoln’s bill suggests that Lincoln made this copy of his amendment\n                  turned bill in order to present it in the House.    In 1861, Lincoln gave his reasons\n                  for not introducing the bill, explaining that upon “finding that I was abandoned by\n                  my former backers and having little personal influence, I dropped the matter knowing\n                  that it was useless to prosecute the business at that time.''Cong.
