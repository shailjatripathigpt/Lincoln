        "text": "2In February 1842, the State Bank of Illinois had collapsed in the wake of the aftermath\n                  of thePanic of 1837and the state’s fiscal crisis associated with exorbitant  spending on theinternal improvement system.  In January 1843, theIllinois General Assemblyenacted legislation calling for the appointment of a bank commissioner to oversee\n                  the bank’s liquidation.  The act gave the bank four years to conclude its affairs.\n                  Although the act stipulated that the bank was to go into immediate liquidation, it\n                  merely commenced what would become a lengthy period of delays and false dawns.  As\n                  March 4, 1847--the date set for the end of the bank--approached, the institution was\n                  far from ready to wind up its business, forcing the General Assembly to pass an act\n                  extending the life of the bank until November 1, 1848.  To avoid any unnecessary delays\n                  or procrastination, the governor appointed three trustees to wrap up the business,\n                  and the legislation included several provisions to ensure a speedy settlement.  By\n                  November 1848, affairs of the bank remained far from settled, so GovernorAugustus C. FrenchappointedNicholas Ridgley,Uri Manley, andJohn Calhountrustees to settle its business.  Settlement of the bank’s affairs dragged on through\n                  the late 1840s and 1850s, finally concluding in 1862.Charles H.
