        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Adams of December 5, 1854 has not been located but it\n                  was likely similar to others that Lincoln wrote in November and December of 1854 soliciting\n                  the support of newly-elected members of theIllinois General Assemblyfor his potential candidacy forU.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of the Missouri Compromise had reawakened Lincoln’s passion\n                  for politics, and he threw himself into the congressional election campaign in the\n                  fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates. He even allowed himself to become\n                  a candidate for the Illinois General Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the\n                  election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible\n                  nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats. Lincoln won election to the Illinois\n                  House of Representatives in the 1854 election, but declined the seat in late November\n                  in order to run for U.S. Senate.

        "text": "3The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855 to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate. In the first round of voting, Lincoln received forty-five of\n                  the ninety-nine votes cast, but as no candidate received a majority of votes, several\n                  more rounds of balloting ensued. Adams voted for Lincoln in the first seven rounds\n                  of voting, then switched his support to anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbull. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes declining, Lincoln dropped out of\n                  contention and urged his remaining supporters to vote for Trumbull to ensure that\n                  an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Adams continued his support of Trumbull\n                  through the tenth and final vote when Trumbull earned a majority of votes and was\n                  elected Illinois’s next U.S. Senator.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
