    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on Printing of Governor's Message, 26 November 1840 TheGovernor’smessage, was announced, and read from theclerk’s table. Mr.Loganmoved the printing of 500 copies. MrMurphymoved 5,000. Mr.Learymoved 10,000. The question, on Mr.Leary’s motion being taken, it was lost—ayes 35—noes 40. Mr.Cavalrymoved 8,000; which was carried—ayes 45—noes 38.1 Mr.Lincolndemanded the ayes and noes which was seconded by Mr.Henderson. Mr.Hardin, inquired if 5,000 were not the usual number. He though it was; but as theStatewas very rich andout of debt, it couldnowafford to print double the number. Mr. Henderson said, he had always regarded the printing of so many copies of the Governor’s\n               message, a useless waster of the public money.—The message would be printed in all\n               the newspapers of both political parties, and there read by all who desire to read\n               it.  When we reflect, said Mr. H. that for the last eight years the State has not\n               had a dollar it could call its own,—that our printing last year cost us $23,000, and\n               that in our present condition retrenchment is absolutely necessary, is it not high\n               time that we should practice Economy, as well as preach it?2 Mr.Pecksaid that when thepartyof which thegentleman, (Mr. Henderson) was a member, was in the majority, we had heard nothing of extravagance\n               in the public printing—the additional cost of printing 8, instead of 5 thousand, would\n               only be 30 or 40 dollars.  The people were every where looking for the Message with\n               anxiety, and it should be extensively circulated. Mr. Henderson begged leave to inform thegentlemanthat thepartyof which he was a member, had never been in a majority at a time when they could\n               control the public printing. Messrs.[Messieurs]KitchellandTurneywere in favor of printing 8000—it was no economy to withhold light from the people.\n               Their constituents all desired to see the Message, and they would pledge themselves\n               that every one which should fall to their lot, should be distributed. Mr.Lincolnsaid he had moved for the ayes and noes on this motion to print 8000 copies, from\n               a higher consideration than the saving of 30 0r 40 dollars, which thememberfromCookhad said would be theonlyadditional expense. He would grant that 30 0r  40 dollars were not worth quarelling about.  But when we reflected, that if we now quarrel about 40 dollars, and it is\n               nevertheless allowed, would not the presumption be very strong, that hereafter, many\n               such sums, will be allowed without a quarrel, and without objection. Some experience in this matter had convinced him that it was altogether useless to\n               print so much as we had even been in the habit of doing.  He would appeal to the experience\n               of every member who had served in theLegislatureif one half of them were ever distributed.  No sir; from the time they are printed,\n               until the end of the session, they can be found every where in places nameable and\n               unnameable—in short, every where, but amongst the people. Mr. Logan said he remembered on going home last session to have found in one post-office\n               as many as would lie on theclerk’s table, which he had sent to his constituents and which were never taken out.  He\n               would go for the lowest number. The ayes and noes were then taken on the motion to print 8000, and the motion lost—Ayes\n               42, Noes 46.3 Mr.Parsonsmoved six thousand; which was lost—Ayes 43, Noes 45. The motion to print 5000, was then put and carried.",
