After theWhig National ConventionnominatedWilliam Henry Harrisonfor president, Lincoln took charge of Harrison’s campaign inIllinois, canvassing the state to promote theWhig Partyand its ticket.  In March, Lincoln began campaigning as he rode the Eighth Judicial\n                  Circuit.  Lincoln commenced this debate at noon after the close of theTazewell County Circuit Court.

        "text": "3During the campaign of 1840, Whigs sought to counter the Democratic claim that Harrison\n                  was anabolitionistby repeating an accusation, originally made in the1836 election, that Van Buren endorsed enfranchisement for free blacks during the 1821 New York\n                  Constitutional Convention.  Van Buren voted in favor of giving blacks the right to\n                  vote, but later in the convention voted that they be excluded unless they possessed\n                  property valued at $250.“Janus-faced” refers to Van Buren’s supposed duplicitous, two-faced behavior during\n                  theWar of 1812.   Van Buren’s opponents after the war regularly condemned him for his reluctance\n                  to join the fighting--he turned down the offer of a military commission--and for not\n                  doing enough in theNew York Senateto support the war effort.  In point of fact, Van Buren was a War Hawk who crafted\n                  and shepherded through many pieces of war legislation, including the raising of troops.\n                  In September 1814, he authored a radical measure allowing the governor to conscript\n                  12,000 men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five to defend the state. The New\n                  York Legislature passed the bill, but the war ended before it could become operational.Nathaniel H. Carter, William L. Stone, and Marcus T. C.
