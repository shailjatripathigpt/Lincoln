        "text": "2Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office.  Abraham Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored\n                  over Morrison and Edwards. As competition for the job intensified, Henderson and Josiah\n                  M. Lucas urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s capital to personally lobby for the\n                  position.  On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;Josiah M.
