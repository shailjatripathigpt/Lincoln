        "text": "3Dummerrepliedto this letter after a brief delay.The fee Lincoln requests was related to the caseSprague v. Illinois River RR et al. In August 1857, Charles Sprague, a resident ofCass County, Illinois, retained Lincoln and Dummer and sued for an injunction to prevent the county from\n                  paying theIllinois River Railroad Company$50,000 in stock subscriptions approved by the voters. TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in 1853 to build a road fromJacksonville, Illinois, through Cass County toLa Salle, Illinois.  In 1854, however, the General Assembly amended the charter to allow the railroad\n                  to build a road fromVirginia, IllinoistoPekin, Illinois. The railroad also held the option of extending the route north from Pekin to La\n                  Salle. Sprague, who also was president of the Rock Island and Alton Railroad Company,\n                  claimed that he had consulted engineers who stated that part of the railroad’s route\n                  was an “absurd proposition” due to rough terrain and the presence of three other railroads.\n                  Sprague also believed that the alteration of the railroad’s charter constituted a\n                  breach of contract and voided the county stock subscription.  The Cass County Circuit\n                  Court disagreed, and dismissed the injunction.  Sprague appealed to theIllinois Supreme Court, which, in January 1858, affirmed the lower court’s ruling.  Chief JusticeJohn D. Catondeclared that the Illinois General Assembly’s 1854 amendment of the railroad’s charter\n                  was “in the highest degree promotive of the interests of the company” and not a major\n                  deviation from the charter's original intent.Lincoln and Dummer exchanged at least three more letters related to this case.Newton Bateman and Paul Selby, eds.,Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of Cass County, ed. by Charles Æ.

        "text": "4Dummer provided Lincoln political advice and information in hisreply. At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running againstDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglasas theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. At the time,  members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, so elections\n                  to theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere important for Lincoln's campaign.In the local elections of 1858, Beardstown and Cass County voters elected Democratic\n                  incumbentSamuel W. Fullerto the Illinois Senate and DemocratWilliam Engleto the Illinois House. In the election as a whole, Republicans won a majority of\n                  all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the General\n                  Assembly, and Douglas won reelection, with both Fuller and Engle voting for him. Through\n                  the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.The Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 November 1858, 2:4; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 556-57; Allen C.
