        "text": "1This summary is excerpted from a longer, unsigned article in theBloomington Pantagraphdescribing severalAmerican Party, Democratic and Republican meetings held inBloomingtonaround this time. No other account of this speech byAbraham Lincolnhas been located.Lincoln was in Bloomington by September 9, 1856 to attend theMcLean County Circuit Court. In addition to this speech, he spoke again at Major’s Hall in the city on the evening\n                  of September 16, 1856, responding critically to speeches given at a Bloomington Democratic\n                  meeting earlier that day. Lincoln had left Bloomington by September 17, when he gave\n                  a speech inUrbana.From July 1856 onwards, Lincoln gave over fifty speeches acrossIllinoisin support of Republican presidential candidateJohn C. Fremontand to rally the disparate elements of the emerging Republican Party.

        "text": "2In addition to speaking critically about American Party presidential candidateMillard Fillmore, Lincoln was around this time sending  form letters to Fillmore supporters arguing\n                  that Fillmore had little chance of winning the 1856 election and urging them to join\n                  in support of Fremont in order to defeat Democratic candidateJames Buchanan.The great political question upon which Fillmore maintained relative neutrality in\n                  the 1856 election was the expansion of slavery to the territories. Fillmore instead\n                  focused on the preservation of the union, denouncing Democrats for reawakening sectionalism\n                  by introducing theKansas-Nebraska Actand Republicans for inflaming the issue.Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Hull;Abraham Lincoln to Edward Lawrence;Abraham Lincoln to Harrison Maltby;Abraham Lincoln to William Ryan; Michael F.

        "text": "3The platform adopted by the1856 Democratic National ConventioninCincinnatiincluded an endorsement of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the principle of popular sovereignty.\n                  WhileStephen A. Douglashad invited southern support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act by the offer of popular sovereignty\n                  as a potential means for undoing the limitations on slavery imposed by theMissouri Compromise, he was one such northern Democrat who argued that under popular sovereignty territories\n                  were actually more likely to choose to be free states. In the 1856 election, Republicans\n                  sought to exploit the disillusion of northern voters  with this failed promise of\n                  northern Democrats by highlighting the events ofBleeding Kansas.Following this account of Lincoln’s speech, theWeekly Pantagraphstates thatT. Lyle Dickeyalso gave brief remarks at the Republican meeting.Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore in thepresidential election of 1856.  Buchanan captured Illinois with 44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont\n                  and 15.7 for Fillmore.  InMcLean County, of which Bloomington was the county seat, Fremont garnered 48.2 percent of the vote\n                  to 37.7 percent for Buchanan and  14.1 percent for Fillmore.Official Proceedings of the National Democratic Convention, Held in Cincinnati.
