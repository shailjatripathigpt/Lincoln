Pekin Ills4 The petition of Citizens ofTazewell county, Illinoispraying protection for the emigrants to California–5 Refer to Com. on Teritories– Your Memorialists, citizens of the valley of theMississippi, would respectfully state to Your Hon. Body; that in consequence of the discoveries\n               during the past year of the extraordinary mineral wealth inCalifornia, which, on various occasions, have been communicated to Your Hon. Body;  and of their\n               great and increasing extent, as appears from the latest dates which have been received\n               from the scene of the discoveries; not only a large body of citizens of the United\n               States from the  East, the valley of the Mississippi, and fromOregon, have already emigrated to California; but great additional numbers are expected\n               to move for that country from the valley of the Mississippi during the ensuing spring\n               and summer, by the route of the  Grand Prairies and theRocky Mountains, carrying with them not alone the goods and property peculiar to emigrating parties,\n               but merchandize, and money, to exchange for gold:2 2d. And, in consequence of the extraordinary riches already developed in these mines;\n               their apparent durability; their wide extent of Territory embraced; their great facility\n               of operation on the surface, by the poorer classes; without the expensive agency of\n               machinery; for these reasons, Your Memorialists are of opinion, that the emigration\n               to California will probably increase by this route, from the valley of the Mississippi,\n               for years to come; until the production of these mines, already wonderful; shall become\n               immense. 3d. Your Memorialists would, accordingly, suggest to Your Hon. Body, the wisdom of\n               establishing an early, safe, and regular commercial communication by this route between\n               California and the valley of the Mississippi: whereby the  great number of citizen\n               miners; of the poorer classes (who, from the bosom of the nation are destined to employment\n               in these mines,) may be accommodated with a safe, cheap, and direct transmission of\n               their mineral products to their friends in the older portions of the Union, at stated\n               periods; and receive also, merchandize and money in return—at stated periods: and whereby, the riches of the mines, thus\n               diverted in a great degree from foreign countries, may be made to flow directly into\n               the centre of the Union. 4th. And, Your Memorialists would respectfully state to Your Hon. Body, as the result\n               of their opinion after a careful examination of the subject; that this safe commercial\n               communication betweenMissouriand California should be speedily established; as a large emigrating party will leave\n               early in the ensuing spring for California: that it should be guarded by about 600\n               to 800 men, one half mounted Riflemen, and the other half Dragoons; that the whole\n               convoy force should be divided into four divisions, or reliefs, each of 150 to 200\n               men; that two of these divisions should always winter in California, and the other\n               two atFort Leavenworth. 5th. And Your Memorialists would respectfully state, that the season of operation\n               for the convoys being the spring and summer; one of the two reliefs stationed in California,\n               and one of the two reliefs stationed at Fort Leavenworth, would start in the spring,\n               simultaneously (about the middle of April) the former, for Missouri, as the convoy\n               for the mineral products; the latter for California, as the convoy for the emigrating\n               party, merchandize, and money. And these, called the spring convoys, arriving at their several places\n               of destination at Ft.[Fort] Leavenworth and California about the middle of July, would be immediately relieved\n               by the summer convoys, there waiting. Which last, starting from Ft. Leavenworth and California simultaneously (about the middle of July) would arrive\n               at their several places of destination about the 1st Nov.[November]; thus completing the whole trip from Missouri to California and back; and from California\n               to Missouri and back; in six months: and thus affording to each miner in California\n               a direct and safe transmission of the mineral wealth to the Mississippi valley, twice\n               a year, viz: 1st. by the spring convoy in April; and 2d. by the summer convoy in July;\n               and securing also, in like manner, corresponding returns twice a year from the valley\n               of the Mississippi. Wherein Your Hon. Body will perceive, that as each convoy makes\n               but half the trip in one year; or is on  travel but three months in one year; the\n               annual duties of the convoys would not only be possible, but easy, and practicable\n               to the troops; and might, in consequence, be continued even for years, by the same\n               convoy force: and when after a few years it became necessary to relieve this force\n               by replacing another of equal strength; the two regiments of Dragoons and the mounted\n               Rifle regiment now in service would always afford the means of relief without additional\n               expense to the Government. 6th. Your Memorialists would, accordingly, respectfully ask of Your Hon. Body the\n               early passage of an appropriation for establishing a fort, or permanent post at some\n               point in California convenient to the gold region, to serve for the point of departure\n               of the convoys; for the assembling of the caravans; and for the collection and security\n               of the mineral wealth, preparatory to its transmission East, under the protection\n               of the convoys. And, Your Memorialists would further, respectfully state, that as\n               one of the convoys would always be present at this post during the spring and summer;\n               and two of them during the remaining six months of the year; there would, in consequence,\n               be no additional expense incurred on account of the force necessary to garrison this\n               fort. 7th. And, in cases of the transmission of gold by the convoys from California, or\n               in the remission of specie by the same from the  Valley of the Mississippi, wherein\n               no agent or owner be present in charge of the same; cases which, as may appear to\n               Your Hon. Body, may be of frequent occurrence from the multitude of small miners employed\n               in these mines; in such, your Memorialists would respectfully suggest, that Your Hon.\n               Body would cause such Regulations to be established concerning the reception of said\n               gold and specie, by the Commander of the convoy, or other officer: concerning its\n               safe keeping in transit, and at the points of arrival and departure: and concerning\n               its delivery and charges by the U.S., at the points of arrival of the convoys; as\n               in your wisdom may appear to suit these new and pressing emergencies of commerce. 8th. Your Memorialists would, in conclusion, beg leave most respectfully to submit\n               to Your Hon. Body, the great necessity of a speedy and prompt action in the matters\n               herein, which, we have the honor to submit to Your Hon. Body; in order that, the necessary\n               arrangements may be completed by the Executive for the organization and location at\n               Ft. Leavenworth by the 1st April next, of the convoy force destined for this service;\n               which force, of itself, Your Hon. Body will perceive can occasion no additional expense\n               to the Government; the troops being already in service, partly in this country, partly\n               in California; and the service (protection against Indians) being in conformity to\n               the original object or law of their organization: so that, Your Hon. Body will perceive\n               that, there are no existing reasons which might prevent the immediate action of the\n               Government as regards the organization and location of the convoy force by the 1st\n               April; and the early publication of the same throughout the valley of the Mississippi\n               for the information of the people, preparatory to the departure of a large emigrating\n               party in the spring. And Your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. &c.[etc. etc.]3",

And these, called the spring convoys, arriving at their several places\n               of destination at Ft.[Fort] Leavenworth and California about the middle of July, would be immediately relieved\n               by the summer convoys, there waiting. Which last, starting from Ft. Leavenworth and California simultaneously (about the middle of July) would arrive\n               at their several places of destination about the 1st Nov.[November]; thus completing the whole trip from Missouri to California and back; and from California\n               to Missouri and back; in six months: and thus affording to each miner in California\n               a direct and safe transmission of the mineral wealth to the Mississippi valley, twice\n               a year, viz: 1st. by the spring convoy in April; and 2d. by the summer convoy in July;\n               and securing also, in like manner, corresponding returns twice a year from the valley\n               of the Mississippi.
