        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln might not have been entirely ingenuous in his reasons for introducing\n                  theresolution. In January 1835, theGeneral Assemblypassed anactdefining the duties of and the method for selecting the public printer.   Section\n                  one stipulated that the House of Representatives andSenatewould select the public printer by joint ballot at the beginning of each session.\n                  As party divisions solidified and hardened, partisanship came to the fore in these\n                  elections, enabling the majority party, which was theDemocratic Partyduring most of this period, to hold sway in these contests.  During Lincoln’s time\n                  in the House, the public printers wereJohn Y. Sawyer(1835-36), founder, editor, and publisher of the solidlyDemocratic-RepublicanIllinois Advocate; andWilliam Walters(1837-1841), editor and publisher of theIllinois State Register, successor of the Advocate and also  stronglyDemocratic.  Lincoln voted for other candidates in each of the four elections in which he cast\n                  a ballot.  He had  particular animus toward Walters and clamored to replace him, as\n                  evidenced by his impassionedlettertoAndrew McCormickin January 1839, in which he castigated McCormick for voting for Walters.  Lincoln\n                  proposed this resolution in part to embarrass Walters and help his friendSimeon Francis, editor of theWhig-leaningSangamo Journal, in the upcoming election for public printer.Franklin W. Scott, \"Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879\" (PhD diss.,\n                     University of Illinois, 1910), 167, 322, 341, 342; Illinois HouseJournal. 1835. 9th G.

        "text": "5The House appointed Lincoln,Lyman Trumbull, and Ormsbee a select committee to investigate expenditures for public printing.\n                  Lincoln was chairman, but the Democrats held a two to one majority.  On January 16,\n                  1841, Ormsbee, not Lincoln, presented the committee’s report.   The House Journal\n                  does not record the report's contents, but both theSangamo Journaland theIllinois State Registeropined that the report found nothing untoward in the expenditure for public printing\n                  and exonerated Walters of any wrong-doing.   TheIllinois State Registerrevelled in the report, but theSangamo Journallabelled it a “white-washing affair altogether.”  Lincoln did not issue a minority\n                  report, a fact explained in part by his poor health.  Lincoln was absent from the\n                  House from January 13 to 19 suffering from what he termed “hypochondriaism” presumably\n                  brought on by his reputed breaking of his engagement toMary Toddon, as Lincoln described it later to his friendJoshua F. Speed, the “fatal first of Jany[January] 41[1841].” Lincoln spent several hours each of\n                  those days receiving treatment fromAnson G. Henry.  His condition was common knowledge among his colleagues, as indicated in a letter\n                  fromMartinette McKeetoJohn J. Hardin, written on January 22: “We have been very much distressed, on Mr. Lincoln’s account;\n                  hearing that he had two Cat fits and a Duck fit since we left.” TheSangamo Journalclaimed that “Mr. Lincoln’s health did not permit him to examine the Report,  and\n                  he did not read it until several days after it made its appearance before the House.”\n                  TheState Registercountered on January 29 that “Mr. Lincoln has recovered from his indisposition, and\n                  has attended the House for more than a week past during which time he made no minority\n                  report; although he attended every meeting of the committee of Investigation.”Along with its report, the select committee introduced two bills,HB 120andHB 121.HB 120amended the 1835actwhich defined the duties of the public printer, fixed the time and manner of performing\n                  printing for the state, and set prices for various publications.  The House and Senate\n                  passedHB 120on February 11 and 18, respectively, and theactbecame law on February 23.HB 121proposed election of a public printer.  The House passed the bill on February 10,\n                  but the Senate postponed further consideration on February 26.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G.
