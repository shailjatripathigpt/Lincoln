Scott argued that “threats of hostilities” on the U.S. frontier as well as the recent\n                  acquisition of territory fromMexiconecessitated this increase in U.S. military forces. PresidentZachary Taylorendorsed Scott’s recommendations during his annual address to the U.S. Congress,\n                  which he delivered on December 24, 1849.On June 17, 1850, Congress passed an act to increase the rank and file of the U.S.\n                  Army and encourage enlistments. The act specifically empowered the president of the\n                  United States to increase the number of privates serving on the western frontier as\n                  well as at “remote and distant stations.” The act made no mention of an accompanying\n                  increase in the number of U.S. Army officers, however.H.R.
