In the1858 Federal Election, he was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to supplantDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senate.  See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.The $50.00 fee Dummer references was Lincoln’s legal fee for work on the caseSprague v. Illinois River RR et al. In August 1857, Charles Sprague, a resident ofCass County, Illinois, retained Lincoln and Dummer and sued for an injunction to prevent the county from\n                  paying theIllinois River Railroad Company$50,000 in stock subscriptions approved by the voters. TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in 1853 to build a road fromJacksonville, Illinois, through Cass County toLa Salle, Illinois.  In 1854, however, the General Assembly amended the charter to allow the railroad\n                  to build a road fromVirginia, IllinoistoPekin, Illinois. The railroad also held the option of extending the route north from Pekin to La\n                  Salle. Sprague, who also was president of the Rock Island and Alton Railroad Company,\n                  claimed that he had consulted engineers who stated that part of the railroad’s route\n                  was an “absurd proposition” due to rough terrain and the presence of three other railroads.\n                  Sprague also believed that the alteration of the railroad’s charter constituted a\n                  breach of contract and voided the county stock subscription.  The Cass County Circuit\n                  Court disagreed, and dismissed the injunction.  Sprague appealed to theIllinois Supreme Court, which, in January 1858, affirmed the lower court’s ruling.  Chief JusticeJohn D. Catondeclared that the Illinois General Assembly’s 1854 amendment of the railroad’s charter\n                  was “in the highest degree promotive of the interests of the company” and not a major\n                  deviation from the charter's original intent.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 12 August 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-12;Report of Speech at Beardstown, Illinois;Summary of Speech at Beardstown, Illinois; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Newton Bateman and\n                     Paul Selby, eds.,Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of Cass County, ed. by Charles Æ.

One resolution came close to what Dummer advised\n                  regarding the extension of slavery into U.S. territories: it declared that theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in theDred Scott casewas “political heresy” and maintained that—despite the ruling that the U.S. Constitution\n                  permits slavery in U.S. territories—the U.S. Congress “possesses sovereign power over\n                  the territories. . . [and] it is the duty of the general government to protect the\n                  territories from the curse of slavery.”In hisreply, Lincoln denied that the party was committed to preventing the admission of additional\n                  slave states.The false claim that the Republican Party’s platform declared that it “was pledged\n                  never to admit another slave State into the Union” was one that Douglas later repeated\n                  during theLincoln-Douglas Debates.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:5; Sixth Debate with Stephen A.

The plot began, Lincoln\n                  argued, with Douglas’Kansas-Nebraska bill, which PresidentFranklin Piercesupported, then was advanced by both the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Dred\n                  Scott case—handed down by Chief JusticeRoger B. Taney—and by PresidentJames Buchanan’s call to support the court’s decision. Lincoln warned that if Douglas were not defeated\n                  and the slave power not overthrown, another Supreme Court ruling could build upon\n                  the Dred Scott decision and proclaim that the U.S. Constitution prohibited states\n                  from excluding slavery within their own borders.Lincoln repeated his arguments about Douglas being part of a plot to nationalize slavery\n                  throughout the 1858 campaign—both in speeches and during the Lincoln-Douglas Debates.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:459-61, 492-540; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 206-9."
