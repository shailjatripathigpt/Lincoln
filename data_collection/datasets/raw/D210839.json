He and Douglas also canvassed thestatethroughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for\n                  theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the state’s race for the U.S. Senate seat.\n                  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Douglas spoke in Mattoon on July 30. Like Tremble, theDaily Illinois State Journalreported that the Mattoon audience gave three cheers for Lincoln at the conclusion\n                  of Douglas’ speech.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

        "text": "3Throughout thecampaign of 1858, Douglas attacked Lincoln and other Republicans’ criticism of theU.S. Supreme Court’s decision inScott v. Sandford, arguing that any criticism of the court’s decision was tantamount to resistance\n                  of the U.S. government as a whole and was also evidence of a desire for the “amalgamation”\n                  of the races. Lincoln countered these attacks repeatedly throughout the campaign,\n                  asserting that although he believed that the Declaration of Independence applied to\n                  all men—not just white men—he did not favor full social and political equality between\n                  the races. He also pointed to Douglas’ hypocrisy in arguing that Lincoln and his fellow\n                  Republicans’ criticism of the Dred Scott decision was disloyal, pointing to Douglas’\n                  previous praise of PresidentAndrew Jacksonfor defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the 1819 caseMcCulloch v. Maryland, when the court declared that theU.S. Congresshad the power to create a national bank.

He also passed through Mattoon\n                  again on September 17, before proceeding toCharlestonon September 18 for one of his seven debates with Douglas.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly, and Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, however,\n                  and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln\n                  gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 8 September 1858, 1:2; 21 September 1858, 1:1; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:556-57."
