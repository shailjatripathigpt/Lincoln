After serious consideration of the offer, Lincoln  declined this position, at least\n                  in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:307;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250."

        "text": "4Prior to offering Lincoln appointment as governor of the Oregon Territory, the Taylor\n                  administration had also offered Lincoln appointment as secretary of the Oregon Territory.\n                  He  also declined this appointment, recommending Simeon Francis for the position instead.\n                  The administration offered Lincoln these positions in Oregon after Taylor appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both  Taylor and Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln a political\n                  appointment in the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and\n                  prevent additional attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment.In the end, Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory. Francis’ name does not appear in the official\n                  registers of the officers and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,\n                  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did not receive any other appointment during this\n                  period. The 1861 official register shows Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army.  In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Appointment of Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Territory of Oregon;Abraham Lincoln to John M.
