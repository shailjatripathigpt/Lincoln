        "text": "2Davis is discussing Leonard Swett’s efforts to gauge support among members of theIllinois General Assemblyfor Abraham Lincoln’s candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S.\n                  Senate seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. He\n                  likely wrote Davis such a letter, although no correspondence between Lincoln and Davis\n                  in the whole of 1854 prior to this letter has been located.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.Davis incorrectly identifies “Stewart” as “the member from Kendall;” it wasAlanson K. Wheeler. In 1854, the voters of Kendall County elected Wheeler to theIllinois House of Representatives.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

        "text": "7In Illinois’ Seventh Congressional District,DemocratJames C. Allennarrowly won an intensely competitive race againstRepublicanWilliam B. Archer. The contest came down to a single vote: Allen received 8,452 votes\n                  to Archer’s 8,451. Allen received the certificate of election, but Archer contested\n                  the outcome.Congressnullified the results and left the seat vacant until a new election could be held.\n                  In August 1856, Allen defeated Archer in a special election.Davis and Swett each wrote Lincoln several letters related to Lincoln’s candidacy\n                  for the U.S. Senate after this letter.Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General\n                  Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Both John Strunk and Gavion D. A. Parks cast their votes for Lincoln for\n                  six ballots, then Strunk switched his vote toJoel A. Matteson.   Parks switched his vote to Trumbull on the eighth ballot. Wheeler voted for Lincoln\n                  for eight ballots, then switched his vote to Trumbull. Both Day and Strawn cast their\n                  initial votes for Lincoln, but then each switched to other candidates—Day voted forMartin P. Sweettwice before switching to Trumbull, and Strawn voted for Trumbull and thenWilliam B. Ogdenbefore switching back to Trumbull. See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.Howard W.
