He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first).

        "text": "4The platform that Lincoln is likely referring to isabolitionism. Although his campaign focused on refuting the Kansas-Nebraska Act and emphasizing\n                  the necessity of halting the spread of slavery in the United States, Lincoln did not\n                  go so far as to support abolishing slavery. HewroteIchabod Codding, also on November 27, “I suppose my opposition to the principle of slavery is as\n                  strong as that of any member of theRepublican party; but I had also supposed that theextentto which I feel authorized to carry that opposition, practically; was not at all\n                  satisfactory to that party.” Ultimately, Lincoln did not win election to the U.S.\n                  Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
