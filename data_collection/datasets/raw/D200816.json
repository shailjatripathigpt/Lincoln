He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, in late-November 1854,declinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln did not win election\n                  to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.

Lamaster\n                  added that while he had not seen William Kellogg or Amos C. Babcock, Kellogg had previously\n                  expressed his support for Lincoln, and newly-elected Whig representative Babcock was\n                  politically inexperienced but would soon learn his duty.When the Illinois General Assembly met on February 8, 1855, to vote on the state’s\n                  next U.S. Senator, William Kellogg was himself nominated as a candidate in the first\n                  round of voting. The sole vote he received was from Babcock and he did not appear\n                  as a candidate in subsequent rounds of voting. Babcock switched his vote to Lincoln\n                  for votes two through five, supportedOrville H.
