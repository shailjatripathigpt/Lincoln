        "text": "1This summary, which  appeared in theAltonWeekly Courier, is the only contemporary account of the Abraham Lincoln’s so-called “Lost Speech”\n                  delivered at the1856 Illinois Anti-Nebraska Convention.  A text of Lincoln’s remarks in his hand is not extant.  In 1896, Henry C. Whitney\n                  reconstructed Lincoln’s speech from his notes, and he published this lengthy reconstruction\n                  inMcClure’s Magazinein September 1896.  Some collections of Lincoln’s writings and speeches include Whitney’s\n                  version, but Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, did not include it, dismissing it as “not...worthy of serious consideration.”  The\n                  editors have followed Basler in only including the summary from theAlton Weekly Courier.On May 24, 1856, aSpringfieldconvention, attended by citizens “who are opposed to the repeal of theMissouri Compromise, and who are opposed to the present administration,” elected Lincoln as a delegate\n                  to the Illinois Anti-Nebraska Convention to be held May 29 inBloomington. Lincoln started for the convention on May 27 and arrived the next day to make an\n                  impromptuspeechthat evening.  The day of the convention, May 29, Lincoln made this speech at the\n                  end of the event.Roy P. Basler, ed.,The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 2:341; H. C.

        "text": "5The Black Democracy was a term sometimes used for pro-slaveryDemocrats.National Whigs was a short-lived attempt to revive the Whig Party after the1854 Federal Elections.  The movement originated inNew York, where the Silver Grays, conservatives opposed toWilliam H. SewardandThurlow Weed, held a convention in January 1855 to re-constitute the Whig Party based on opposition\n                  to theKansas-Nebraska Act, support forCompromise Measures of 1850, and opposition to fusing with other groups to form a sectional party.At the conclusion of Lincoln’s speech, “the audience sprang to their feet, and cheer\n                  after cheer told how deeply their hearts had been touched, and their souls warmed\n                  up to a generous enthusiasm.” TheIllinois State Journaldescribed it: “For an hour and a half he [Lincoln] held the assemblage spell-bound\n                  by the power of his argument, the intense irony of his invective and the deep earnestness\n                  and fervid brilliancy of his eloquence.”Hinton Rowan Helper,Compendium of the Impending Crisis of the South(New York: A.
