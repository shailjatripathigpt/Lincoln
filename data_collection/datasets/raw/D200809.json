He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first).  As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats.In hisreplyto Lincoln on November 20, Hoyt provided Lincoln with the names ofKane County’s representatives in the Illinois General Assembly and his opinion whether they would\n                  vote for Lincoln in the Senate election.Augustus AdamsandBenjamin Hackneyrepresented Kane County in theIllinois SenateandHouse of Representatives, respectfully, during the Nineteenth General Assembly.Hoyt later wrote at least two more letters to Lincoln on the topic of Lincoln’s candidacy\n                  for the U.S. Senate.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, in late-November 1854,\n                  declined to serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln  did not\n                  win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
