        "text": "5O’Connor almost certainly invited Lincoln to attend a Republican Party meeting in\n                  Iowa and deliver an address. Lincoln was in high demand as a speaker for the Republican\n                  Party during the1856 Federal Electioncampaign. He delivered more than fifty speeches throughout Illinois as he stumped\n                  on behalf ofJohn C. Fremont, the Republican candidate for president, and other Republican candidates.Norman B. Judd,Ebenezer Peck, andJames W. Grimeshad each also invited Lincoln to speak in Iowa.  In a July 12letterto Grimes, Lincoln outlined different reasons for refusing their invitations than\n                  the reasons he gives O’Connor in this letter.Lincoln delivered one politicalspeechoutside Illinois during the 1856 campaign season—inKalamazoo, Michiganon August 27.  Lincolnspokeat a rally inVandalia, Illinoison September 23, the day O’Connor wanted him to speak in Iowa.Lincoln’s belief that Iowa was safe for the Republicans proved accurate: Fremont carried\n                  Iowa with 48.8 percent of the vote to 40.7 percent forDemocraticcandidateJames Buchananand 10.5 forAmerican PartycandidateMillard Fillmore.  Lincoln also had a reason to be worried about Illinois: Buchanan carried Illinois\n                  with 44.1 percent of the vote to Fremont’s 40.2 percent and Fillmore’s 15.7 percent.\n                  In the nation-wide tally, Buchanan won 45.3 percent of the popular vote to 33.1 percent\n                  for Fremont and 21.5 percent for Fillmore.  Buchanan won theElectoral Collegewith 174 votes to 114 for Fremont and 8 for Fillmore.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:425;Norman B.
