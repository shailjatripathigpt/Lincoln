        "text": "3At a Whig convention inPekinin May 1843, an agreement was made between Lincoln,Edward D. Baker, and John J. Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective\n                  Whig congressmen. Hardin and Baker having each served one term, Lincoln believed that\n                  the 1846 nomination should have been his. While Lincoln set out to solidify his support\n                  in the district, Hardin proposed that the convention system for the nomination be\n                  thrown out in favor of a primary election. LincolnrejectedHardin’s proposal on January 19, 1846, and Hardin subsequently declined the nomination\n                  entirely.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 2:218, 231;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 26 February 1846, 2:1-2."
