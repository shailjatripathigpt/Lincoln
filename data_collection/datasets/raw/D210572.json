Yates\n                  was seeking reelection to theU.S. House of Representativesas Illinois’  Sixth Congressional District representative. The Democrats nominatedThomas L. Harrisas his opponent.

        "text": "5Lincoln’s reply, if he wrote one, has not been located. He delivered aspeechin Chicago against the Kansas-Nebraska Act on October 27, 1854, which White covered\n                  in positive terms in his newspaper, theChicago Journal.As White references above, the members of the Illinois General Assembly were responsible\n                  for electing the state’s  U.S. senators; therefore, the composition of the state legislature\n                  was critical to the outcome of the senatorial race. Three days after the election,\n                  but before the outcome was known, Lincoln began quietly seeking support for a seat\n                  in the U.S. Senate, writing confidentially to political allies and friends.In Illinois’ Second Congressional District,  which included Chicago and other parts\n                  of Northern Illinois,James H. Woodworth, aFree-SoilDemocrat running as aRepublican, won the seat, defeating Democrat John B. Turner, WhigRobert S. Blackwell, and anti-Nebraska DemocratEdward L. Mayowith 53.1 percent of the vote. This was a shift from theelection of 1852, in which DemocratJohn Wentworthwon the Second Congressional District with 46.7 percent of the total vote, compared\n                  to WhigCyrus Aldrich’s 39.9 percent and Free Soil candidateJames H. Collins’ 13.3 percent. In the state as a whole in 1854, Republicans won 52 percent of the\n                  vote compared to Democratic candidates’ 43 percent. Illinois voters  sent an anti-Nebraska\n                  majority to the Illinois General Assembly.Lincoln had allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first).   As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee to supplant Shields as U.S. Senator.\n                  Lincoln won a seat in the General Assembly, but in late-November 1854, Lincoln declined\n                  to serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln\n                  did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska\n                  DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no politically-oriented speeches\n                  or public statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies\n                  in his law practice.Abraham Lincoln to Hugh Lamaster;Abraham Lincoln to Joseph Gillespie;Abraham Lincoln to Horace W.
