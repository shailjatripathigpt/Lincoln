    "full_text": "Report of Legislative Proceeding regarding the Admission of Wisconsin into the Union,\n               11 May 1848 Mr.LINCOLNmoved to reconsider the vote by which thebillwas passed.1 He stated to theHousethat he had made this motion for the purpose of obtaining an opportunity to say a\n               few words in relation to a point raised in the course of the debate on thisbill, which he would now proceed to make, if in order. The point in the case to which\n               he referred arose on the amendment that was submitted by the gentleman fromVermont(Mr.Collamer) in Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, and which was afterwards renewed\n               in the House, in relation to the question whether the reserved sections, which, by\n               some bills heretofore passed, by which an appropriation of land had been made toWisconsin, had been enhanced in value, should be reduced to the minimum price of the public\n               lands. The question of the reduction in value of those sections was to him, at this\n               time, a matter very nearly of indifference. He was inclined to desire that Wisconsin\n               should be obliged by having it reduced. But the gentleman fromIndiana, (Mr.C. B.Smith,) the chairman of the Committee on the Territories, yesterday associated that question\n               with the general question, which is now to some extent agitated in Congress, of making\n               appropriations of alternate sections of land to aid the States in making internal\n               improvements, and enhancing the price of the sections reserved; and thegentleman from Indianatook ground against that policy. He did not make any special argument in favor of\n               Wisconsin; but he took ground generally against the policy of giving alternate sections\n               of land, and enhancing the price of the reserved sections. Now he (Mr. L.) did not,\n               at this time, take the floor for the purpose of attempting to make an argument on\n               the general subject. He rose simply to protest against the doctrine which the gentleman\n               from Indiana had avowed in the course of what he (Mr. L.) could not but consider an\n               unsound argument.2 It might, however, be true, for anything he knew, that the gentleman from Indiana\n               might convince him that his argument was sound; but he (Mr. L.) feared that gentleman\n               would not be able to convince a majority in Congress that it was sound. It was true,\n               the question appeared in a different aspect to persons in consequence of a difference\n               in the point from which they looked at it. It did not look to persons residing east\n               of the mountains as it did to those who lived among the public lands. But, for his\n               part, he would state that if Congress would make a donation of alternate sections\n               of public land for the purpose of internal improvements in hisState, and forbid the reserved sections being sold at $1[.]25, he should be glad to see the appropriation made; though he should prefer it if\n               the reserved sections were not enhanced in price. He repeated, he should be glad to\n               have such appropriations made, even though the reserved sections should be enhanced\n               in price. He did not wish to be understood as concurring in any intimation that they\n               would refuse to receive such an appropriation of alternate sections of land because\n               a condition enhancing the price of the reserved sections should be attached thereto.\n               He believed his position would now be understood; if not, he feared he should not\n               be able to make himself understood. But before he took his seat he would remark that theSenate, during the present session, had passed a bill making appropriations of land on that\n               principle for the benefit of the State in which he resided—the State ofIllinois. The alternate sections were to be given for the purpose of constructing roads, and\n               the reserved sections were to be enhanced in value  in consequence. When that bill\n               came here for the action of this House—it had been received and was now before the\n               Committee on Public Lands—he desired much to see it passed as it was, if it could\n               be put in no more favorable form for the  State of Illinois. When it should be before\n               this House, if any member from a section of the Union in which these lands did not\n               lie, whose interest might be less than that which he felt, should propose a reduction\n               of the price of the reserved sections to $1[.]25, he should be much obliged; but he did not think it would be well for those who\n               came from the section of the Union in which the lands lay to do so. He wished it,\n               then, to be understood that he did not join in the warfare against the principle which\n               had engaged the minds of some members of Congress who were favorable to improvements\n               in the western country.3 There was a good deal of force, he admitted, in what fell from the chairman of the\n               Committee on Territories. It might be that there was no precise justice in raising\n               the price of the reserved sections to $2[.]50 per acre. It might be proper that the price should be enhanced to some extent,\n               though not to double the usual price; but he should be glad to have such an appropriation\n               with the reserved sections at $2[.]50; he should be better pleased to have the price of those sections at something less;\n               and he should be still better pleased to have them without any enhancement at all. There was one portion of the argument of the gentleman from Indiana, the chairman\n               of the Committee on Territories, (Mr.Smith,) which he wished to take occasion to say that he did not view as unsound. He alluded\n               to the statement that the General Government  was interested in these internal improvements\n               being made, inasmuch as they increased the value of the lands that were unsold, and\n               they enabled the Government to sell lands which  could not be sold without them. Thus,\n               then, the Government gained by internal improvements, as well as by the general good\n               which the people derived from them, and it might be, therefore, that the lands should\n               not be sold for more than $1[.]50 instead of the price being doubled. He, however, merely mentioned this in passing,\n               for he only rose to state, as the principle of giving these lands for the purposes\n               which he had mentioned had been laid hold of and considered favorably, and as there\n               were some gentlemen who had constitutional scruples about giving money for these purposes,\n               who would not hesitate to give land, that he was not willing to have it understood\n               that he was one of those who made war against that principle. This was all he desired\n               to say, and having accomplished the object with which he rose, he withdrew his motion\n               to reconsider.4",

But, for his\n               part, he would state that if Congress would make a donation of alternate sections\n               of public land for the purpose of internal improvements in hisState, and forbid the reserved sections being sold at $1[.]25, he should be glad to see the appropriation made; though he should prefer it if\n               the reserved sections were not enhanced in price. He repeated, he should be glad to\n               have such appropriations made, even though the reserved sections should be enhanced\n               in price. He did not wish to be understood as concurring in any intimation that they\n               would refuse to receive such an appropriation of alternate sections of land because\n               a condition enhancing the price of the reserved sections should be attached thereto.\n               He believed his position would now be understood; if not, he feared he should not\n               be able to make himself understood."

The alternate sections were to be given for the purpose of constructing roads, and\n               the reserved sections were to be enhanced in value  in consequence. When that bill\n               came here for the action of this House—it had been received and was now before the\n               Committee on Public Lands—he desired much to see it passed as it was, if it could\n               be put in no more favorable form for the  State of Illinois. When it should be before\n               this House, if any member from a section of the Union in which these lands did not\n               lie, whose interest might be less than that which he felt, should propose a reduction\n               of the price of the reserved sections to $1[.]25, he should be much obliged; but he did not think it would be well for those who\n               came from the section of the Union in which the lands lay to do so. He wished it,\n               then, to be understood that he did not join in the warfare against the principle which\n               had engaged the minds of some members of Congress who were favorable to improvements\n               in the western country.3"

        "text": "There was one portion of the argument of the gentleman from Indiana, the chairman\n               of the Committee on Territories, (Mr.Smith,) which he wished to take occasion to say that he did not view as unsound. He alluded\n               to the statement that the General Government  was interested in these internal improvements\n               being made, inasmuch as they increased the value of the lands that were unsold, and\n               they enabled the Government to sell lands which  could not be sold without them. Thus,\n               then, the Government gained by internal improvements, as well as by the general good\n               which the people derived from them, and it might be, therefore, that the lands should\n               not be sold for more than $1[.]50 instead of the price being doubled. He, however, merely mentioned this in passing,\n               for he only rose to state, as the principle of giving these lands for the purposes\n               which he had mentioned had been laid hold of and considered favorably, and as there\n               were some gentlemen who had constitutional scruples about giving money for these purposes,\n               who would not hesitate to give land, that he was not willing to have it understood\n               that he was one of those who made war against that principle. This was all he desired\n               to say, and having accomplished the object with which he rose, he withdrew his motion\n               to reconsider.4"
