        "text": "2Bullock omitted a year of composition for this letter, but it almost certainly dates\n                  to  the period between 1855 and 1860 when Abraham Lincoln  acted as agent in relation\n                  to the sale of Springfield property belonging to Bullock, who wasMary Lincoln’s aunt.Bullock’s request here that friends direct their letters for her through her nephew,\n                  Levi T. Rodes, suggests that this was written  sometime after Rodes’ father  William\n                  Rodes died in July 1856 and the younger Rodes rose in seniority in the household.\n                  In November 1856, Lincoln also began collecting payment on some of the promissory\n                  notes that were used to purchase Bullock’s land. On November 13, 1856, Lincoln deposited\n                  into his account atSpringfield Marine & Fire Insurance$970 he had collected for Bullock on some such notes and on December 16, 1856, he\n                  remitted these funds to her. The timing of these transactions could correlate to this\n                  November correspondence on how Lincoln should handle Bullock’s assets.The editors, however,  are currently supplying a year of 1857  for this letter based\n                  on Bullock’s references to a “distraction in monied matters” and to the possibility\n                  of bank suspensions, which seems to correlate with the financialPanic of 1857, one of the first major suspensions of which was that of theNew Yorkoffice of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company in August 1857. This was followed\n                  by the suspension of banks along the east coast throughout September, and specie payments\n                  were stopped in much of the country by mid-October. The situation soon eased, however,\n                  and by December 1857 banks in New York andNew Englandhad resumed specie payments, with other cities following suit. By the following summer\n                  the situation had improved throughout the United States.Further support for a date of 1857 for this letter comes from the fact that by late\n                  in 1858, another nephew,Charles D. Carrof Kentucky, had taken over corresponding with Lincoln on behalf of an ailing Bullock,\n                  and no further letters from Bullock herself to Lincoln after that time have been located.Lincoln sold land as agent for Bullock, Martha L.
