    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on Bill for Relief of William Dormody, 21 December 1840 Mr.MurphyofCook, from the select committee to which was referred the petition of Mr.Dormandyfor remuneration for the destruction of certain notes, of theState Bank, reported aBillfor his relief—authorising the auditor to issue his warrant in favor of Mr.  Dormandy in the proportion to $600\n               that the amount of stock owned by the Bank, is to the whole stock.1 Mr.Gridleymoved to refer the Bill to the Judiciary Committee. Mr. G. doubted the propriety of Legislation upon this case.  Thepetitionerhad his remedy at law, and the courts were his proper resort.  It was ruinous policy\n               for theLegislatureto interfere in matters belonging to the judicial tribunals of the country—the precedent\n               was a bad one. Mr.Murphyof Cook objected to the reference.  This was a notorious case throughout theState.  The facts were simply these, that the petitioner by the misfortune of a fire in\n               his dwelling house got these Bank notes destroyed, there being only enough of them\n               left to establish their identity as notes of the State Bank.  He had presented these\n               at the Bank and demanded payment, which was fraudulently and ungratefully refused.\n               He had since twice resorted to the courts of law; but by the chicanery of the law\n               and lawyers, he had been defeated. He had other notes destroyed at the same time,\n               on theIndianaandKentucky Bank, which had been promptly paid.  He comes now to demand that justice at the hands\n               of the State, who is the principal stock-holder, which the Bank and the Courts have\n               fraudulently witheld. Mr.Webbinquired how thegentlemanfromCookcame in possession of those facts? Had witnesses been examined under oath? Mr.Murphyanswered—no witnesses had been examined; the facts were notorious. Mr.Lincolnsaid, as  wholesale charges of fraud had been dealt out by the gentleman from Cook,\n               which involved many of his constituents, he felt it his duty to say something in regard\n               to this case.2 It was not true, as thegentlemanhad stated, that the petitioner had been defrauded through the chicanery of the law,\n               or of the courts.  He would inform theHousethat since this Legislature had met, the naked question of fact, of the actual destruction\n               of these notes, accompanied by any question of law, had been submitted to a jury,\n               of the petitioner’s own choice, and that a majority of this jury had solemnly decided\n               that it was an attempt on the part of Dormady to impose upon the Bank.  Under such\n               circumstances, was it not assuming too much for the gentleman from Cook to get up\n               here and tell us, without examination on his part, that the facts were as he had stated\n               them, and that there was fraud and perjury on the part of the Bank, thecourt, and the jury? Mr.Murphy, in reply, said, it was somewhat strange thegentlemanshould impute fraud to one of his own constituents.  He supposed Mr. Dormady was\n               aloco, and did not vote for the gentleman, (Mr. Lincoln) which accounted for his offering\n               the petition.  He did not charge the jury with perjury—it was nothing unusual for\n               a jury to disagree about a just claim, especially where they had the instructions\n               of a judge to help them, against right.  It might be that  Mr. Dormady was unable\n               to procure such testimony as was necessary in a court of law.  Mr. M. recapitulated\n               the circumstances of the case which he contended were sufficient to justify the House\n               in passing the bill. Mr.Lincolnsaid, he did not know whether Mr. D. voted for him or not—he presumed he did not.\n               If there were those in this House who thought this fact would have any influence on\n               his conduct in regard to this bill, he should not stop to enlighten them as to his\n               motives; he was careless of the opinion of such.  The gentleman from Cook persisted\n               in reciting what he termed thefactsof this case. He would say to the House that the trial, to which he had before alluded,\n               was presided over byJudge Breese, whom the gentleman would not charge with partiality to the Bank—that this jury was\n               composed in part by Mr. D.’s own political friends—that he had able counsel to assist\n               him, and that upon the naked question, as to whether these notes were burnt or not,\n               a majority of that jury had determined, after hearing under oath all the testimony,\n               and the arguments of counsel, that these notes were not burnt.3—And yet the gentleman, without investigation, assumed that for granted, which the\n               jury found otherwise, and upon this assumption charged fraud and dishonesty upon the\n               Bank, and all who had any thing to do with the case.  He thought it better  that one\n               man should rest under the imputation of fraud than one hundred. Mr.Kitchellsupported thebill.  He was one of the committee to which the petition had been referred, and was satisfied\n               of Mr. Dormady’s right. Mr.Minshallremarked that the question here presented was a serious one.  It was whether the\n               Legislature was to interfere with the judicial tribunal, and give relief, where they\n               would not.  The precedent was a bad one—every disappointed suitor would be at our\n               doors in a few years, if this was countenanced. Mr.Gridleysaid we should not set the precedent of allowing claims, which the courts refused\n               to allow.  If it were true that by any technical or legal hindrance, this petitioner\n               had been unable to recover upon the merits of his case, then there would be some propriety\n               for legislative interference.  But he had every opportunity for presenting his case\n               upon its merits, and had failed to make out an equitable claim. Messrs.[Messieurs]DoughertyandCavarlywere in favor of the reference. The bill was then referred to the judiciary.4",
