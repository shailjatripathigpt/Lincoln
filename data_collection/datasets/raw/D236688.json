        "text": "1Tarrant A. Perkins wrote and signed this letter and wrote the postscript.The actual date of this letter is unknown, but there is strong evidence that Perkins\n                  wrote it during the intense competition for patronage that dominated the first nine\n                  months of the presidency ofZachary Taylor.  On May 4, 1849, Perkins firstwroteAbraham Lincoln regarding John Lowry, andEdward D. BakerwroteLincoln on June 8 regarding Perkins’ advocacy for Lowry, admitting that he could\n                  not “at the present moment ask anything” of President  Taylor and his administration\n                  and suggesting that Lincoln might be more fortunate.  Lincoln endorsed Perkins’ letter,\n                  and apparently sent it and other letters to Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing.\n                  Lincoln’s endorsement is undated, but docketing on the letter indicates that theU.S. Department of the Interiorreceived the letter on or before June 23.  Lincoln received no further correspondence\n                  on Lowry, and if he wrote another letter of recommendation, it is not extant.  Perkins’\n                  reference to Baker and “house proceedings” suggests that theU.S. House of Representatives, of which Baker was a member, was either already in session  or preparing to begin\n                  its session.  Lincoln’s correspondence indicates that the scramble for patronage receded\n                  as the opening ofCongressapproached, and the Thirty-First Congress convened on December 3, 1849, so editors\n                  believe that Perkins wrote the letter between May 5 and December 3, 1849.Michael F.
