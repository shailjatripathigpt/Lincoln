        "text": "2Lincoln omitted the day of composition of this letter. Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln,  assigned this letter a date of circa August 17, 1857. Basler may have calculated\n                  this date based on Lincoln’s dating this letter in August, and the approximate travel\n                  time of James W. Grimes’s letter of the 14th, which Lincoln mentions below as having\n                  received and which was presumably sent from Grimes’s home in Iowa. Lincoln fails to\n                  mention what month Grimes’s letter of the 14th was composed, but it seems likely to\n                  have been written in August, as Lincoln is apparently here writing after the August\n                  3, 1857 referendum vote on the 1857 Iowa state constitution.  As it is unknown when\n                  Lincoln received Grimes’s letter, the only certainty is that this letter was composed\n                  by Lincoln some time after Grimes  wrote his letter on 14 August.Roy P.

        "text": "4On August 3, 1857, the voters of Iowa had voted to approve a new state constitution\n                  which reduced the term of the governor from four years to two and added the position\n                  of lieutenant governor. The first election to be held under the new constitution was\n                  scheduled for October 13, 1857. Grimes was the current Republican governor of Iowa,\n                  having run for the office in 1854 as a member of theWhig Party, then joining the newly-organized Republican Party during his term. As governor,\n                  the new constitution had been one of his priorities, and he was influential in its\n                  drafting. In the October 1857 election Iowans ultimately elected RepublicansRalph P. Loweas  governor and Oran Faville as the state’s first lieutenant governor, and returned\n                  a Republican majority to theIowa General Assembly. Grimes was credited with turning Iowa firmly Republican.Grimes outlined his anxieties before the election in a circular letter dated September\n                  3, 1857. He argued that a Democratic victory at the polls would be a blow to the causes\n                  of free soil and free labor, and would ensure thatKansaswas admitted as a slave state. Grimes was also concerned by the declaration of Iowa\n                  Democrats that they intended to amend the new constitution to prohibit African Americans\n                  from being able to testify in court. The new constitution was also written with an\n                  eye to expanding and strengthening banking in Iowa, and Grimes posited that the election\n                  of anti-bank Democrats to the  governorship and to a majority of seats in the Iowa\n                  General Assembly  would prevent any such expansion from being enacted. He further\n                  pointed out that party control of the Iowa General Assembly was important as that\n                  body would soon chose Iowa’s next U.S. Senator. Grimes himself ultimately won Iowa’sU.S. Senateseat in 1858.Joseph Frazier Wall, “Grimes, James Wilson,”American National Biography, ed. by John A. Garraty and Mark C.

In April 1856 the Rock Island Bridge Company completed construction of a railroad\n                  bridge across theMississippi RiverconnectingRock Island, Illinois, with Davenport, Iowa. On May 6, 1856 the steamboatEffie Aftonstruck the bridge and was destroyed along with its cargo. The owners of the steamboat\n                  sued  the Rock Island Bridge Co. in October 1856 in an action of trespass on the case\n                  for damages to recover the value of their lost property.John M. Douglass,Norman B. Judd, andJoseph Knoxwere retained as defense attorneys, and Lincoln was added as an additional attorney\n                  in July 1857. The trial commenced in U.S. Circuit Court for the Northern District\n                  of Illinois in Chicago on September 8, 1857 and ran until September 24. The plaintiffs\n                  argued that the bridge was a hazard since the piers were not parallel to the current\n                  of the river. Lincoln and the defense countered that fewer than one percent of boats\n                  that traveled under the bridge had accidents and that operator error was to blame.\n                  The trial resulted in a hung jury on September 24, 1857, and while the plaintiffs\n                  later attempted unsuccessfully to retainStephen A. Douglasto pursue the matter further, no evidence has been located that the court heard the\n                  case again.Hurd et al. v. Rock Island Bridge Co., Martha L.

In addition to the changes to state offices described above, the\n                  new constitution included provisions for an elected judiciary. The previous Iowa constitution\n                  of 1846 had prohibited the creation of any corporations with the power to circulate\n                  money or with banking privileges; the new constitution of 1857 included provisions\n                  to allow for the creation and regulation of corporations with banking powers. The\n                  delegates to the constitutional convention also debated the civil rights of African\n                  Americans in Iowa, and the August 3, 1857 referendum in which Iowans voted whether\n                  to accept the new constitution also included a question on whether the word “white”\n                  should be struck from the constitution clause on suffrage. The constitution was approved\n                  by a vote of 40,311 to 38,681, but only 8,207 votes were cast in favor of enshrining\n                  suffrage without reference to race, so the constitution as enacted in 1857 restricted\n                  voting to white citizens.Contemporary newspapers were split over the extent to which the adoption of the 1857\n                  Iowa constitution followed party lines. In the reporting of election results newspapers\n                  pointed out examples of counties where Republican candidates lost, but the constitution\n                  claimed a majority of votes. The editors of theDavenport Daily Gazette, however, indignantly claimed the adoption of the constitution as a Republican victory,\n                  arguing  that Republican newspaper editors across the state had campaigned vigorously\n                  in support of it.Iowa Const. of 1846, art.
