        "text": "2Lincoln received $40 for his legal services in representing David M. Irwin and heirs\n                  of Thomas Payne in lawsuits against Henry H. Hall. In 1830, Payne purchased eighty\n                  acres of public land southwest of what would becomeVirginia, Illinois, and in 1834, he would purchase an additional eighty acres. Knowing that he was dying,\n                  Payne made his will on September 4, 1835.  The will provided for the division of 160\n                  acres of land among Payne's five children and stipulated that any land sale had to\n                  yield at least $8 per acre.  Payne named no executor in the will, however, and he\n                  died shortly thereafter.  On September 9, the court appointed Benjamin H. Gatton administrator\n                  of Payne's estate.  Gatton sold the land to Hall, who owned the land east, west, and\n                  north of it, for $1,400, or $120 more than $8 per acre.  In October 1843, however,\n                  Payne's heirs sued Hall inCass County Circuit Courtto eject him from the land.  In May  1844, Irwin and Payne's heirs succeeded in getting\n                  the case transferred to the Sangamon County Circuit Court.Stephen T. Logan, representing Payne’s heirs, argued that Gatton, as the administrator, had no power\n                  to sell the land because only an executor could perform the sale.  The court refused\n                  Hall's offer of Gatton's deed as evidence of ownership.  In July, the jury found for\n                  Payne's heirs, and the court ordered Hall to convey the land to them.  In December\n                  1844, Hall appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court on the grounds that the lower court\n                  erred in refusing to admit the deed as evidence, and Payne's heirs retained Lincoln.\n                  The parties agreed that the Supreme Court should consider only the question regarding\n                  an administrator's power to sell and convey land.  The Supreme Court affirmed the\n                  judgment, with JusticesRichard M. YoungandWalter B. Scatesdissenting.  Writing the court's opinion, based primarily on English sources and\n                  a strict construction of the Illinois statute of wills, JusticeGustavus P. Koerneragreed with Lincoln that an executor, but not an administrator, had the power to\n                  sell the land.  In dissenting, Young and Scates emphasized the need to interpret properly\n                  the state's statute of wills rather than English law or the laws of sister states.\n                  In July 1846, Hall sued the heirs in Sangamon County Circuit Court for an injunction\n                  blocking their taking possession of the property until they paid him approximately\n                  $4,000 for his improvements.  Lincoln continued to represent Irwin and the heirs of\n                  Payne. In November 1850, the court granted the injunction but later ruled for Payne's\n                  heirs and dismissed the case.For documents related to these three cases, seeIrwin et al. v.
