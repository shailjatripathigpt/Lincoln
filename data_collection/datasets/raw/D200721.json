        "text": "2The writ that Lincoln references was not enclosed in this letter, and its whereabouts\n                  is unknown.Lincoln was in Bloomington to attend theMcLean County Circuit Court, which opened on September 27, 1852.The “little trouble” Lincoln references was a lawsuit involvingWilliam de Fleurville, James Allin, Asahel Gridley, and the heirs of David Prickett.  Allin, Gridley, and\n                  Prickett laid off an addition to Bloomington.  Prickett agreed to give de Fleurville,\n                  an African American barber in Springfield, four lots in exchange for shaving him during\n                  his lifetime.  De Fleurville failed to record his deed and lost it.  De Fleurville\n                  retained Lincoln and sued Allin, Gridley, and Prickett's heirs in theMcLean County Circuit Courtto enforce conveyance of the deed.  Charles R. Wells was the administrator of Prickett’s\n                  estate.  Allin and others failed to appear, and the court ordered the defendants to\n                  convey the deed.  Lincoln paid the costs in the suit, except the Sangamon County sheriff's\n                  fees, for de Fleurville.  De Fleurville’s widow sold the lots some years after his\n                  death for $2,500.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 27 September 1852,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1852-09-27; for documents related to this case, seeFlorville v.
