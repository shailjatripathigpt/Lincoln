        "text": "3Lucas references the battle over who would replaceRichard M. Youngas commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office.  Justin H. Butterfield, James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere all vying to succeed Young.  As Lucas hoped, Abraham Lincoln would  eventually\n                  become a candidate for the job.  Neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the\n                  appointment, the job going to  Butterfield instead. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Young had appointed Lucas as a temporary clerk in the Land Office in March 1849, but\n                  Lucas was worried about his tenure with rumors swirling that Young was to be replaced.\n                  Lucas held onto his job through the spring, and he sent Lincoln a steady stream of\n                  letters informing Lincoln on the contest for commissioner and on appointments to land\n                  offices throughout Illinois.  Lucas’ name does not appear in the official register\n                  of the officers and agents of the government employed as of September 30, 1849, so\n                  he must have lost his position.  His name also does not appear in the official register\n                  for 1851, but he is listed in the official register for 1853 as a clerk in the U.S.\n                  General Land Office.Abraham Lincoln to George W.
