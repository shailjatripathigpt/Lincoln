    "full_text": "Report of Legislative Debate on Bill to Complete the Illinois and Michigan Canal,\n               26 February 18411 Thebillfor the early completion of theIllinois and Michigan canalwas taken up. Mr.Lincolnoffered an amendment, allowing theStateto pay in Bonds at par for all work hereafter done, and to issue therefor $3,000,000\n               bonds. Mr.Bissellmoved to strike out 3 and insert $1,500,000. Mr.Lincolnaccepted the amendment. Messrs.[Messieurs] Lincoln andDodgesupported the bill, and Mr.OrmsbeeandKitchellopposed it. Mr.Kitchellwas surprised at the course of the gentleman fromSangamon(Mr.Lincoln.)—We were already prostrated by debt, and that gentlemen thought it would be for\n               the interest of the State to go still deeper. Mr. K. said it reminded him of an anecdote,\n               which he would relate.  A drunkard inArkansastook so much of thecretur, that he lost his reason and remained for some time in a state of insensibility.\n               His wife tried every experiment to cure him; but it was of no avail, until a neighbor\n               came to the house and recommended somebrandy toddy. The insensible man rose at the wordtoddy, and said “that is the stuff.”  It was so with the gentleman from Sangamon—more debt\n               would be for the better. Mr.Lincolnreplied.  He begged leave to tell an anecdote.  The gentleman’s course the past winter\n               reminded him of an eccentric old bachelor who lived in theHoosier State.  Like the gentlemon fromMontgomery,  he was very famous for seeingbig bugaboosin every thing.  He lived with an older brother, and one day he went out hunting.\n               His brother heard him firing back of the field, and went out to see what was the matter.\n               He found him loading and firing as fast as possible in the top of a tree. Not being able to discover any thing in the tree, he asked him what he was firing\n               at.  He repled[replied] a squirrel—and kept on firing.  His brother believing there was some humbug about\n               the matter, examined his person, and found on one of his eye lashes abig lousecrawling about.  It was so with the gentleman from Montgomery.  He imagined he could\n               see squirrels every day, when they were nothing butlice. (TheHousewas convulsed with laughter.) The [question?] was taken on agreeing to the amendments of Mr. Lincoln, and decided in the negative—yeas\n               41, nays 32. The bill was then ordered to a third reading.",
