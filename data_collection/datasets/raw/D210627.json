        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’sletterto Gillespie of December 1, 1854 requested that as a member of theIllinois General Assembly, which would select Illinois’ next U.S. Senator, Gillespie would consider supporting\n                  Lincoln’s candidacy for the seat provided he did not intend to run for the office\n                  himself. Lincoln also inquired as to whether anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullintended to run, and speculated that if so, the General Assembly members fromMadisonandSt. Claircounties would be likely to support him. Lincoln wrote numerous similar letters to\n                  other members of the Illinois General Assembly in November and December of 1854 soliciting\n                  support.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates. He even allowed himself to become\n                  a candidate for the Illinois General Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the\n                  election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible\n                  nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.

        "text": "3The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate. Gillespie was correct that Madison County RepresentativeHenry S. Bakerfavored an anti-Nebraska Democrat, and that fellow Madison County RepresentativeGeorge T. Allenwould vote similarly to Baker. Both men supported the ultimate victor, Lyman Trumbull,\n                  through all ten rounds of balloting. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes\n                  declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his remaining supporters to\n                  vote for Trumbull to ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Trumbull\n                  won the election on the tenth vote. See the1854 Federal Election.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G. A., 242-55; Victor B.
