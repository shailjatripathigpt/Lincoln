        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote and signed this letter.  The original letter, which was owned\n                  by Edward D. McCulloch of Peoria, Illinois, as of 1953, has not been located. Edward\n                  McCulloch found the letter while going through the papers of his father, David McCulloch,\n                  who had been an associate in the law firm of brothersAmos L. andHalsey O. Merriman.  Edward McCulloch did not know to which brother Lincoln addressed the letter, but\n                  noted that an endorsement--which is not included in the copy received by the Abraham\n                  Lincoln Association--was in Amos’s handwriting.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln,  was unable to identify to which brother Lincoln sent this letter.  A search in\n                  the    passport records at the National Archives, however, lead to the discovery of\n                  aletterfrom Halsey to Lincoln dated January 28, 1848, which confirms that Lincoln addressed\n                  this letter to him.Ernest E. East to Benjamin Thomas, 7 January 1938, Abraham Lincoln Association Copy\n                     Files, Lincoln Collection, Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum,  Springfield,\n                     IL; Roy P.
