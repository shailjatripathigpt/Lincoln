Remainder of enclosure\n                  is in Lincoln’s hand.McRoberts’s and Walker’s Addition to Danville was located southeast of the public\n                  square and northeast of the Vermilion River. The necessity of determining ownership\n                  of these two lots was likely related to the revival in 1853 of the effort by theGreat Western Railroadto complete construction of the line between Danville andDecatur. By 1856, this line was extended from Danville to theIndianastate line as the Toledo, Wabash, and Western Railroad Company, the tracks  of which\n                  passed through lots seven and eight in block eight of McRoberts’s and Walker’s Addition.Joseph Patterson purchased lots seven and eight from Samuel McRoberts, Mary F. McRoberts,\n                  Isaac P. Walker, and Margaret Walker on November 9, 1836. Patterson died intestate\n                  late in 1838 and his wife Docia Patterson was named administrator of his estate. By\n                  July 1840, Docia Patterson had also died, and administration of the estate passed\n                  to Alexander Bailey. Within five years, Oliver L. Davis had taken over administration\n                  of Joseph Patterson’s estate following Bailey’s death.An Illustrated Historical Atlas Map of Vermilion County, Ill.([Edwardsville, IL?]: W. R.
