    "full_text": "Summary of Legislative Debate on Resolution to Adjourn, 27 January 18411 The adjournment resolution introduced by Mr.Hardinon yesterday, to adjournsine dieon the 22d of February, was taken up.2 The question was on the amendment of Mr.Olds—“provided, the necessary business had been transacted.” The amendment was lost—ayes 39—noes 46.3 Mr.Wheeleroffered an amendment, striking out the resolution and inserting a preamble and resolutions,\n               reciting that theLegislaturehad been convened to do the peoples’ business, and that the Legislature could not\n               adjourn until it had been completed, when the members should return home, then and\n               there to give an account to their constituents. Mr.Gillespiesaid some of us might find ourselves in rather an unpleasant situation by the passage\n               of this resolution.—There might be some old bachelor members on this floor who were\n               not so high in the affections of the fair six at home as thegentlemanfromPike(Mr. Wheeler,) and who might prefer to cut out in some different direction.  As for\n               himself, he had no such notion at present, but there were others on this floor for\n               whom he could not speak so positively. Mr.Minshallsaid he was opposed to that part of the resolution, making it obligatory on all members\n               to go home after the adjournment, whether their business called them home or not. It might be that some of us might desire to “cut” forTexas; and whether it was desirable or not, he thought it high time that some of us were\n               leaving for that region. Mr.Wheelerwithdrew the preamble of his resolution. Peckspoke against fixing an early day for adjournment.  There was much important business\n               yet to be transacted.  He thought these resolutions were gotten up for other purposes\n               than to save the peoples’ money,—they were for display abroad.  He was for taking\n               time and doing the business deliberately, he was opposed to hurried Legislation. Mr.Hardinsaid, in the whole course of his life he had never seen a man, so much opposed to\n               haste as thegentlemanfromCook, (Mr. Peck.)  On every occasion he was deprecating haste and hurry.  We had been\n               in session now more than two months, and still he has not had time to prepare the\n               only important measure which was before the finance committee.4There was no haste in adjourning at the time fixed in this resolution.  We shall\n               have then been in session three months—as long a session as was ever held; long enough\n               to have enabled us to have done double the business we will do, and too long by far\n               for the means of the people. Two months in session and when it is proposed to add another and then adjourn, the\n               cry of thegentlemanis still for more time.  When will he agree that we shall adjourn? Will it be next\n               summer? The business never could be done until a day of adjournment was fixed; we should then\n               go to work in earnest and do business. He hoped the resolution as reported from the Judiciary Committee would be adopted. Mr.Pecksaid theHouseneed not expect to drive the Finance committee into action by the passage of this\n               resolution.  There was another way in which they might be called upon to report. Mr.Hardinreplied that we had tried that “other way” long enough.  That committee had repeatedly\n               been called upon to report, but as yet, we had heard nothing. Mr.McClernandopposed the original resolution.  He was opposed to adjourning until the business\n               of the people was transacted.  ThegentlemanfromMorgan, and hisparty, were constantly throwing obstructions in the way of the business of this Legislature,\n               and yet complained that we did not fix an early day for adjournment.  He had no objection\n               to the amendment of the gentleman from Pike, (Mr. Wheeler) except to that part compelling\n               us to go home after adjournment.  We might not all be so fortunate, as he doubted\n               not the gentleman from Pike was, as to have languishing “sweet hearts,” to welcome\n               our return. He would move, therefore, to strike out that part of his amendment. Mr.Hendersonsaid, if the preamble was withdrawn, and the latter part stricken out of the amendment,\n               he saw nothing left, which amounted to any thing; in fact, there was nothing at first\n               either in the beginning, middle, or end, worth voting on, he should, therefore, move\n               to lay the whole amendment on the table. The motion to lay on the table carried. Mr.Bissellmoved to lay the resolution on the table, lost—ayes 42, noes 45.5 Messrs.[Messieurs]CavarlyandParsonsspoke against the resolution, and Messrs. Hardin andLincoln, supported it. Mr.BrownofVermillion, said he did not often trouble the House, by inflicting speeches upon it; but he\n               could not tamely sit by and hear such aspersions and charges reiterated time and again\n               in this House, against thepartywith which he acted, without, at least, entering his solemn protest against it. What\n               had he, or hispartydone to merit such indignity as was constantly heaped upon them in this House? Why\n               was the charge repeated day after day, and upon every occasion, that theWhig partywere retarding the business of this House? Could it be possible that the majority\n               of this House could expect to blind the people by such a miserable subterfuge? It\n               was preposterous to suppose that the Whigs—that Spartan band—that powerless minority\n               with which it was his pride and glory to act, could check and defeat the will of the\n               powerful and overshadowing majority of this body.  When, and upon what measure was\n               it, calculated to advance the interests of the people, that the Whigs were recreant\n               to their duty, and endeavoring to thwart and retard it? When the interest bill was\n               before the House, we used every means in our power to have some permanent provision,\n               connected with it, by which such miserable expedients might be avoided hereafter. It was our conviction, said Mr. B., that if such a provision was not then provided,\n               none whatever would be made, and the subsequent conduct of this House, has but strengthened\n               that conviction.  Was it for this, that we were charged with being false to our oaths,\n               as “Bank bought slaves,” obstructing measures calculated to benefit the people? He\n               had the proud satisfaction of knowing that the Whig party here had used the little\n               power they possessed, in accordance with their honest convictions of right—knowing\n               the motives which had governed them, it was with pride he owned himself a member of\n               thatparty, and only desired, that if the sinking ship of State must go to the bottom, the privilege\n               of clinging to a Whig plank, (Mr. B. was here called to order.) Mr. B. continued—he\n               hoped the resolution fixing the day of adjournment, would be adopted.  He received,\n               almost daily, instructions from his constituents, beseeching him to make this a paramount\n               consideration. The resolution would give a three months session, as long as was ever held in the\n               palmy days of our history, and still, gentlemen complained of hurry and precipitation.\n               It might be that the time was too short to bring to perfection all the mad schemes\n               of a party intoxicated with power, but it was too long for the State of our finances,\n               and the patience of the people. Mr.Peckreplied, at some length, to Mr. Brown.   It was very true the Whigs were in a minority\n               in this House; but by somehocus pocusor arts oflegerdemain, they always contrived to get enough ofdemocratswith them to retard the action and views of the body of the democratic party.  He\n               thought the minority in this House were peculiarly hostile to him, on account of his\n               ultra democratic notions.  As chairman of the Finance committee, the duties devolving\n               upon him were very arduous, and because he had not yet reported a revenue bill, was\n               on account of the great difficulty of agreeing upon its details, and getting the committee\n               to sit upon it.  He thought it impossible that the diversified acts which it  was\n               necessary for us to pass, before we adjourned, could be properly matured and acted\n               upon by the time fixed in the resolution.6 Mr.Webbsaid he could give the gentleman  from Cook, (Mr. Peck) a reason for the Whigs sometimes\n               being in a majority here without ascribing it to “hocus pocus” or “legerdemain.” It\n               was in the language of thegentlemanfromLa Salle, (Mr.Dodge) because some of the democratic members were like young backslidingMethodists—they would not obey theMinister.    Mr. W. thought it absolutely necessary that some day of adjournment should be\n               fixed, and believed this resolution allowed ample time.  By reference to the Journals\n               ofCongress, it would be seen that more business was done during the short session, than the\n               long one.  The Legislature would not apply itself to business until the adjournment\n               was fixed. Mr.Carpentermoved to strike out the 22d of February, and insert the 1st of March. After several unsuccessful motions to amend—several calls of theHouse, and several motions to adjourn—theHousefinally adjourned until 2 o’clock, without taking the question.",

Other members wereWickliffe Kitchell, Alfred W. Cavarly,Albert G. Leary, Edwin B. Webb,Lyman Trumbull,John Dougherty,Stephen G. Hicks, andThomas Drummond.GovernorThomas Carlinhad called for the opening of the Twelfth General Assembly on November 23, 1840,\n                  two weeks before the constitutionally-mandated date for the regular session, in order\n                  to deal with the state debt crisis. Particularly vexing was that the state had no\n                  funds in the treasury to satisfy the interest payment on the debt due January 1, 1841.The Democrats and Whigs in the House of Representatives already had an ugly confrontation\n                  over attempts to adjournsine dieduring this special session.  In December 1839, the state’s debt crisis forced theState Bank of Illinoisto suspend specie payments for a second time.  The bank’sincorporation actand anact supplementarygave the bank sixty days to resume specie payments or forfeit its charter.  On January\n                  31, 1840, theGeneral Assemblypassed anactsuspending stipulations on specie payments until the end of the next legislative\n                  session. On December 5, 1840,  the Whigs, hoping to protect the bank against Democrat\n                  demands that it resume specie payments by the end of the special session or forfeit\n                  its charter, boycotted the General Assembly, thereby preventing the necessary two-thirds\n                  quorum for adjournmentsine die.  When the situation became acute, Abraham Lincoln, Joseph Gillespie, andAsahel Gridley, occupying their seats  as a token representation of Whigs for procedural votes,\n                  exited the House chamber through windows to prevent a quorum and frustrate plans of\n                  the Democrats.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G.
