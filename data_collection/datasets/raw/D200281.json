Davidsonas acting lieutenant governor and acting president of the Senate. He served as such\n                  from December 1836 to December 1838. In 1838, state voters electedStinson H. Andersonover Davidson for lieutenant governor. By November 1841, Davidson had declined the\n                  Whig nomination for governor; soon after, he moved toLouisville, KY, where he became a wealthy banker.
