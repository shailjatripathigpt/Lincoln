In February, Lincoln received similar letters fromJoseph T. Eccles, Marshall, andDavid Woodson.   In March, EddywroteLincoln again to ask about McCallen’s chances and to inquire if Lincoln had placed\n                  him andJohn W. Nortonbefore the proper department head--in this case, Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing--as applicants for the offices of register and receiver, respectively.Eddy did not get the appointment; Lincoln andEdward D. Bakerinstead endorsed McCallen for the position of register.  McCallen received the appointment\n                  and held the job from June 1849 to May 1853.    Norton received the appointment as\n                  receiver, holding that position from June 1849 to 1853.Joseph T. Eccles to Abraham Lincoln;Samuel D. Marshall to Abraham Lincoln;David M.
