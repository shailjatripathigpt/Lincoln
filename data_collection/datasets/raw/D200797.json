    "full_text": "Summary of Speech at Springfield, Illinois, 9 September 18541 The meeting on Saturday Night.— There was a large audience at the court house to hear the discussion of theNebraska question.2 Mr.Calhoun’s remarks were fully equal to his best efforts of the past.3He presented the question in a light that none could misunderstand, and for cogent\n               reasoning, sound argument, and fair dealing with facts involved in the question, we\n               have never heard the question better elucidated.  At the close of his remarks he spoke\n               of theKnow Nothingorganization; their designs, and their tendency towhigery, which could not fail to have convinced his hearers of thepartycharacter of this secret organization. Mr.Lincolnreplied to Mr.C., and, with his usual ability, made the best of a bad position.  We have never heard\n               him when more at fault in covering up the heresies which he habitually takes to. \n               The whole tenor of his discussion was to satisfy thewhigportion of his audience that affiliation withabolitionismwas the only salvation of their party, and (Heaven save the mark!) of the country!\n               He knew nothing of the secret institution of which Mr. Calhoun spoke, and, like theJournal, even “doubted its existence.4Of course he did.  He “Knows Nothing” about it. The result of the debate, we are satisfied, was to convince the audience of the fallacy\n               of the present abolition outcry, and the correctness of the policy of leaving to the\n               people of the territories the adjustment of their own domestic affairs; a privilege\n               which we, asIllinoisans, claim for ourselves, and which we cannot, in justice, deny to others of our fellow\n               countrymen.5",
