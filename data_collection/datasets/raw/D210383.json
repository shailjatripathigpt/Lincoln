William H. Stickney, an independent\n                  Democrat who won election to theIllinois House of Representatives, accused Sloo, in a letter to Charles H. Lanphier dated August 5, of using the editorial\n                  pages of theShawneetown Gazetteto slander him and target him for defeat.  On August 11, the regular Democrats held\n                  a mass meeting and passed several resolutions opposing President Polk and his Oregon\n                  policy.  The independent Democrats staged a mass meeting of their own, lauding the\n                  president and censuring Sloo and Parrish for trying to lead the party into  condemning\n                  Polk.  The meeting also passed a resolution accusing Sloo and Parrish of bringing\n                  the power of government patronage to bear against Stickney and other independent Democrat\n                  candidates.Illinois State Register(Springfield), 21 August 1846, 1:5-6, 7; 3:2."
