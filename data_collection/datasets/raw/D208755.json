        "text": "3Trumbull is referencing the conflict within the Democratic Party over theLecompton Constitution. During the agitation over whether to admitKansasas a free or slave state, pro-slavery Kansans held a constitutional convention inLecomptonfrom September 7 to November 8, 1857, drafting a constitution guaranteeing slaveholders\n                  already in the territory their property rights and leaving the decision whether to\n                  allow new slaves into the territory to voters in a referendum. Voters could vote for\n                  the “constitution with slavery” or the “constitution without slavery,” but were not\n                  offered the opportunity to accept or reject the constitution as a whole. On December\n                  21, 1857, Kansans voting in the referendum on the Lecompton Constitution—free state\n                  Kansans abstained from participating—cast 6,226 votes for Lecompton with slavery and\n                  569 for it without slavery amid charges of voter fraud.  Despite opposition in Kansas\n                  and considerable backlash from Republicans and the anti-slavery faction in the Democratic\n                  Party, PresidentJames Buchanansupported the Lecompton Constitution, urging that Kansas be admitted into the Union\n                  under its terms. Stephen A. Douglas, however, opposed it,  bringing him into conflict\n                  with Buchanan. Buchanan warned Douglas that he faced political reprisals if he opposed\n                  the administration, but Douglas defied the president.   TheU.S. Senateapproved the Lecompton Constitution, but Republicans, Democratic allies of Douglas,\n                  and others, with Douglas as floor leader of the opposition, defeated it in theU.S. House of Representatives.

Douglas\n                  had argued that the Lecompton Convention had no right to form a constitution at all,\n                  or to do any more than present a petition toCongress. Douglas then noted that Buchanan’s pro-Lecompton Constitution stance was subversive\n                  to the entire principle of the Nebraska bill, which was popular sovereignty, or the\n                  right of a states’ voters to determine whether or not that state would allow slavery.\n                  Douglas argued that the Lecompton Constitution did not reflect the will of the actual\n                  inhabitants of Kansas, citing the December 21, 1857 vote that allowed Kansans to vote\n                  for the constitution but not against it.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 19 December 1857, 2:3;Cong.
