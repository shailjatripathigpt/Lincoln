Whitlockalsowroteto Lincoln, asking him if he would visit Clark County. A response from Lincoln has\n                  not been found.Lincoln was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to, DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.
