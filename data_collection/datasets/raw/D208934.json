        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’sletterto Henderson requested that as a member of theIllinois General Assembly, which would selectIllinois’ next U.S. Senator, Henderson would consider supporting Lincoln’s candidacy for the\n                  seat. Lincoln wrote numerous similar letters to other newly-elected members of the\n                  Illinois General Assembly in November and December of 1854 soliciting  support.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.

        "text": "3The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate. Lincoln and Archibald Williams were both nominated for the senatorship.\n                  Of the ninety-nine votes cast in the first vote, Lincoln received forty-five and Williams,\n                  none. Because no candidate received a majority of votes, several more rounds of voting\n                  occurred. Williams received two votes in the second and third ballots, and a single\n                  vote in the fourth, ninth, and tenth ballots. Henderson voted for Lincoln through\n                  nine rounds of balloting. At this point in the proceedings, with his share of votes\n                  declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his supporters to vote for\n                  anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. Henderson cast\n                  his ballot for Trumbull in the tenth and final round of voting, at which point Trumbull\n                  was declared the victor.
