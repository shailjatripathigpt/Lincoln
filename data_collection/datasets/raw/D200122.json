Edwards, but it seems unlikely, because as a member of the10th General Assembly, Edwards could have answered Bennett’s question himself.  Another possibility was\n                  Thomas Edwards, a farmer from nearNew Salem.  This seems more plausible, as on August 3, Lincoln had attended a dinner inAthenshonoring theSangamon Countymembers of the General Assembly.Roy P.
