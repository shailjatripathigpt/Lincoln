        "text": "2The Pekin paper Lincoln references has not been identified.Lincoln was mistaken on this point. Benjamin F. James’ own newspaper, theTazewell Whig, proclaimed John J. Hardin for governor in at least three November issues. On November\n                  15, theAlton Telegraph and Democratic Reviewnoted that theTremontpaper had put forth Hardin’s name for governor. It implied first-hand knowledge that\n                  Hardin would not run for governor, and posited that while no  Whig could win statewide\n                  office, the congressional race would be an opportunity with a greater chance of success.\n                  Lincoln realized his error before writing back to James.The Tazewell Whig(Tremont, IL), 1 November 1845, 2:1; 8 November 1845, 2:1; 15 November 1845, 2:1;Abraham Lincoln to Benjamin F.

        "text": "3At a Whig convention in Pekin in May 1843, an agreement was made between Lincoln,\n                  Edward D. Baker, and Hardin that seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective\n                  Whig congressmen. Hardin and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed that the\n                  1846 nomination should have been his. In  September 1845, Lincoln inquired of Hardin’s\n                  plans, but Hardin would not answer definitively one way or the other.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 2:218, 231;Abraham Lincoln to Henry E.
