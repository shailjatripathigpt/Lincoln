    "full_text": "Summary of Speeches in Virginia, Illinois, 22 February 18441 THE LATECASS COUNTYMEETING . I wish briefly to notice through the columns of your paper two articles that appeared\n               in theState Registerof the 15th instant from the pens ofCass Countyscribblers, affecting to give the proceedings of thewhigmeeting held inVirginia, on the 22d ult.2Were it not the case that they have left truth entirely out of view, their virulent\n               misrepresentations might be suffered to pass.  But truth is powerful and must ultimately\n               prevail though left for a season to grope in the dark shade of mystecism, that may be thrown around it.—It is a conceded point that truth shines the brighter,\n               and is more powerful when its opposite is set in array.  I shall, therefore, consider\n               these articles fully answered, when I shall set forth the ungarbled truth, not considering\n               the low vulgarities that characterise said articles, worthy of notice, (more particularly theonesigned “AVan BurenSentinel.”) Suffer me, then, in a brief manner, to give the outlines of the meeting\n               here on the 22d ult. Pursuant to notice, a large concourse of people (principally whigs,) assembled at\n               the Court House.  Learning that the self-styleddemocracydesired an opportunity to discuss the principles of the two parties, theClay Clubaddressed a letter to them, inviting them to a fair discussion.  They took the proposition\n               under advisement, and after a long consultation, “it was considered and adjudged,”\n               that they would not accede to the proposition.—Finding that they were unwilling to\n               enter into a fair discussion, the meeting was called to order by the President of\n               the Clay Club.T. M.Killpatrick, Esq.[Esquire] being called on for a speech, commenced by alluding to the day we had met to celebrate,\n               and passed a eulogy onGeorge Washington, “who died childless, that his country might call him father.”3Mr. K. then called on thelocosto come out and discuss their principles.JudgePearsonbeing present, was prevailed on by some of his party to come forward, but he would\n               not agree to have any thing said about Mr.Van Buren.  He proposed to discuss some abstract questions.  He, however, finally agreed that\n               Mr. Killpatrick might go on and make his speech, and he would answer him.  Mr. K.\n               accordingly went forward, and made a most excellent speech, in an illustration and\n               defence of the principles of the whig party, and of the merits ofHenry Clay, in contra-distinction to Mr. Van Buren and his principles.  His time having expired,\n               Judge Pearson followed in a labored harrangue of an hour’s length, attempting to answer the unanswerable arguments of Mr. Killpatrick.\n               TheJudgelabored hard to prove the unconstitutionality of aUnited States Bank, denouncing all Banks and bank paper; but being asked by Mr.Lincolnif he was in favor of an exclusive metallic currency, (after evading the question\n               as long as he could,) answered that he was not. The gist of Judge Pearson’s argument on the Bank question, amounted to a condemnation\n               ofWashington, for signing the old United States Bank charter, andMadisonfor approving the late United  States Bank bill.  He saidWashingtonapproved the Bank charter against the dictates of his better judgment, being over-persuaded\n               by FederalHamiltonand others.  Thus making out “the Father of his county,” who was sworn to preserve,\n               protect and defend the constitution, (and who, perhaps, understood it at least, as\n               well as theHon. Judge—God forgive him for his imputations upon the memory and character of Washington,)\n               either as a perjured man, a knave, or a fool!  Who will admit either to be true?—This\n               kind of argument may go down with the self-styled democracy; but never will be received\n               by any true whig, holding the same principles, and breathing the same spirit as the\n               whigs of ‘76[1776].4 Judge Pearson labered arduously to make the impression—boldly asserting—that the Bank of the United States, was a federal measure; that it was chartered\n               by thefederal party, only a fewrepublicansvoting with them.  He must have known better, for the reverse is the fact; but if\n               he did it ignorantly, I suppose we will have to excuse him. He was followed by A.Lincoln,Esq. in an able and eloquent speech, characterised by his well known ability.  He made\n               a clean shucking of theJudge, pointing out the fallacy of his arguments and disproving most of his statements.\n               Mr. L. made a most able and conclusive argument on the Bank question, proving that\n               it was no new fangled scheme, but one advocated and carried out by the fathers of\n               the Republican school. His speech was received by repeated and rapturous applause. Judge Pearson feeling himself used up, and having no surgeon at hand, wished to bind\n               up his wounds in the best manner he could.  He attempted to harrangue the assembly with his unmeaning bombast, but the people having grown weary, and being\n               disgusted with his former effort, dispersed (at least the most part, whigs and locos.)\n               The greater portion of those that remained to hear the Judge were whigs; or, as the\n               “Democrat” correspondent would term them, “decent whigs.” We had a meeting at night, and on the morning of the 23d, addresses were received\n               from Mr. Killpatrick and Mr. Lincoln.  They portrayed the absurdities of loco focoism,\n               and the soundness of whig principles, with great success.  We had some fine songs,\n               and then adjourned with nine cheers forHenry Clay. We aresanguineof success.5",
