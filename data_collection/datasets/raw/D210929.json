Douglas in theelection of 1858. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both campaigned extensively\n                  and focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Allen C.

        "text": "3During a visit to New York City in July 1858, Douglas reportedly met with supporters\n                  of his from the Tammany Society. In September, theChicago Tribunealleged that Douglas had recently sent an emissary to the Tammany Society to plead\n                  for assistance with his reelection campaign, and had received a promise of $50,000\n                  to help fund his campaign. The following month it was reported that New York politician\n                  Fernando Wood, a longtime Tammany supporter who was in the process of organizing rival New York\n                  Democratic organization Mozart Hall,  had given Douglas $52,000 for his campaign,\n                  backed by mortgages on the latter’sChicagoproperty. Wood hoped that the Democratic Party would nominate a southerner for president\n                  in theelection of 1860, and he offered support in 1858 to both Douglas and rival presidential aspirantDaniel S. Dickinson, apparently with the goal that a deadlocked Democratic National Convention in 1860 that would result in such a nomination. Douglas reputedly received a total\n                  of $100,000 in loans from New York allies in the lead up to the election of 1858.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 7 July 1858, 2:3; 10 September 1858, 1:2; 15 September 1858, 2:1;The Belvidere Standard(IL), 19 October 1858, 2:5; Jerome Mushkat,Fernando Wood: A Political Biography(Kent, OH: The Kent State University Press, 1990), 83-87; Robert W.

The final\n                  vote tally gave Democrats a majority of forty to thirty-five in the Illinois House\n                  of Representatives and a majority of fourteen to eleven in the Illinois Senate. Thus,\n                  when the General Assembly voted in January, 1859, Douglas defeated Lincoln and won\n                  reelection to the U.S. Senate.

Richard Barretin the First Congressional District ofMissouriin an election held August 2, 1858. The initial tally of votes found 7,057 votes\n                  for Barret and 6,631 voted for Blair. Stories of voting irregularities and voter intimidation\n                  circulated in the press. Blair contested the election, alleging that fraud had occurred,\n                  and the revised vote was found in his favor. Barret held the seat from March 4, 1859\n                  through June 8, 1860. On the latter date, the U.S. House of Representatives concluded\n                  their investigation into the disputed election and narrowly voted to seat Blair in\n                  Barret’s place. Blair took the seat, but resigned on June 25 and announced his intention\n                  to take his case to the voters of his district. Thus on  August 6, 1860, Blair and\n                  Barret ran against each other in two races: a special election to fill the vacant\n                  seat in the Thirty-Sixth Congress for the remainder of the term, and the regular election\n                  to represent the First Congressional District in the Thirty-Seventh Congress. Barret\n                  won the special election by a margin of 144 votes and finished out the term, serving\n                  from December 3, 1860 through March 3, 1861, but Blair won the full term in the Thirty-seventh\n                  Congress.Daily Missouri Democrat(St. Louis), 1 August 1858, 2:1;Sunday Morning Republican(St. Louis), 1 August 1858, 2:1; Michael J.
