In December 1854,Josiah M. Lucashad alsowarnedLincoln about rumors of a similar plan by members of theKnow Nothing Party.Lincoln was following the election of Illinois’ senator closely after passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened his passion for politics. He threw himself into theelection campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates.  He even allowed himself to become\n                  a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, his name\n                  began to circulate as a possible candidate for U.S. Senator. Although he won election\n                  to theIllinois House of Representatives, on November 25, 1854 he officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for theU.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

William C. Kinney, Albrecht\n                  H. Trapp, and Uri Osgood were all members of the General Assembly; therefore, their\n                  preferences for a U.S. senator were part of Lincoln’s political calculations.On January 6, 1855, LincolnwroteElihu B. Washburne outlining some of his views on the political composition of the\n                  Nineteenth Illinois General Assembly as well as the number of committals he believed\n                  he had at that point in support of him for U.S. senator.Kinney was absent from the Illinois House of Representatives until January 16, when\n                  he presented his credentials, took the oath of office, and claimed  his seat.David Davis to Abraham Lincoln;Jesse O.

No one nominated either Bissell or Yates, and they did not receive any votes\n                  in ten rounds of voting. Kinney and Trapp both voted for Koerner until the seventh\n                  ballot, when Trapp switched to Matteson. Kinney switched from Koerner to Matteson\n                  on the ninth ballot. Kinney’s and Trapp’s votes were the only votes that Koerner received.\n                  Osgood voted for Shields for six ballots, then switched his vote to Matteson.A week after the election, Lincolnwrotethat “It was GovrMatteson’s manoevering that forced upon me and my friends the necessity of surrendering to Trumbull.” See\n                  the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:401-2; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
