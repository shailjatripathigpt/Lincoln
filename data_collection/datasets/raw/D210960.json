Contemporary\n                  newspaper reports of Lincoln’s speech make no mention of Lincoln alluding to Wilcox’s\n                  actions at the Whig National Convention.Lincoln delivered the speech in Rushville in the context of the election to theU.S. Senate.  Lincoln, the candidate of theRepublican Party, was challengingStephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, for the seat.   Both men canvassed the state throughout the summer and\n                  fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time; therefore the outcome\n                  of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to the race for the Senate seat.  See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Lincoln and Douglas both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhig Partystronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Former members of the Whig andAmericanparties were an important source of votes for both Democrats and Republicans in the\n                  state and federal elections of 1858, and both sides worked to garner their support.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 486-87; Allen C.

        "text": "6As part of their respective campaigns, Lincoln and Douglas battled over who best represented\n                  the legacy of Clay. In his speeches and theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Douglas repeatedly invoked the name of Clay in his arguments regarding sectionalism,\n                  slavery, and his purported desire for national unity,  hoped to link Clay to the doctrine\n                  of popular sovereignty as a way to convince former Whigs that he and Clay shared a\n                  common interest in keeping slavery out of national politics.Lincoln greatly admired Clay, whom he referred to during the debates as “my beau ideal\n                  of a statesman, the man for whom I fought all my humble life.” He quoted Clay’s thoughts\n                  on slavery during the debates, emphasizing his agreement with Clay’s view of it as\n                  “a great evil” and an unfortunate inheritance from the nation’s forefathers that its\n                  citizens must contend with as best they could. He also accused Douglas of representing\n                  that class of men whom Clay referred to as determined to “repress all tendencies to\n                  liberty and ultimate emancipation” by snuffing out “the moral lights around us.”Former Whigs turned Douglas supporters condemned Lincoln for abandoning Clay’s principles.\n                  Perhaps more damning, some charged that Lincoln had betrayed Clay in 1847 and 1848\n                  by backing Taylor for president.  James W. Singleton, a former Whig who attended a\n                  meeting of Whig leaders in August 1847 to discuss thepresidential election, claimed in September 1858 in a speech inJacksonvillethat Lincoln went so far as to try and keep him from attending the national convention\n                  knowing that Singleton was backing Clay.  T. Lyle Dickey and other former Whigs took\n                  up this refrain, and Douglas repeated Singleton’s charges in the seventh and final\n                  debate inAltonon October 15.  Douglas also made it the subject of his speech inSpringfieldon October 20.        Lincoln defended himself and his actions in a speech inLincoln, Illinois, on October 16 and again at Rushville.In the state’s local elections as a whole in 1858, Republicans won a majority of all\n                  votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly and Douglas ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through\n                  the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas\n                  Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican\n                  Party.Allen C.
