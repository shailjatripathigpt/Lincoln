The Whigs sought to capitalize\n                  on this accusation to help Taylor in the presidential election, and theDemocratsworked to refute Stewart’s charges.Tazewell County gave Taylor 61.4 percent of its vote, Cass 33.2 percent, andMartin Van Buren, candidate of theFree Soil Party, 5.4 percent.Andrew Stewart,Gen.
