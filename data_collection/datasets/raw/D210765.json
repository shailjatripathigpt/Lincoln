When David expressed outrage at the\n                  actions of the rich man, Nathan used this phrase to point out that David had committed\n                  a similar crime by killing Bathsheba’s husband so that he could marry her himself.2 Samuel 12:1-10."

Herndonresponded to Grigsby on behalf of Lincoln & Herndon on July 29, 1858, stating that\n                  the office was full, but that Grigsby would be welcome as a student if a position\n                  opened. Grigsbywrotea reply to Lincoln & Herndon on August 3, 1858, renewing his application, to which\n                  no direct response has been located. Abraham Lincoln simultaneouslywrotehis own personal response to Grigsby on August 3, 1858, stating that Herndon handled\n                  such applications for the firm, but advising Grigsby that he would become a lawyer\n                  more quickly studying on his own. In an 1861 letter to Lincoln, Grigsby mentioned that he came to Springfield in the autumn of 1858 hoping to speak with either Lincoln\n                  or Herndon, but that neither was in town. Herndon wrote Grigsby a further letter on\n                  April 23, 1859, in response to another unlocated letter from the hopeful student,\n                  in which he reiterated that the office was full and had no room for an additional\n                  law student. The  two letters to Grigsby in Herndon’s hand on behalf of Lincoln &\n                  Herndon are docketed by Grigsby at head of text with notes that appear to be addressed\n                  to Lincoln and which narrate the history of his correspondence with the firm. This\n                  suggests that Grigsby may have at some time enclosed or intended to enclose Herndon’s\n                  correspondence in a letter to Lincoln, but no such covering letter has been identified.Letter, Document ID: 124908; Letter, Document ID: 131067,Lincoln & Herndon declined Grigsby as legal apprentice, Martha L.
