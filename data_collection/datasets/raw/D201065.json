        "text": "4Lincoln predicted Douglas’s response exactly. In the Freeport debate on August 27,\n                  Lincoln asked Douglas, “Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful\n                  way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its\n                  limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution?” Douglas responded by establishing\n                  what became called his “Freeport Doctrine.” The central belief he espoused stated\n                  that slavery could not exist without “friendly legislation” to  protect it. Therefore,\n                  Douglas argued, the people of a territory, prior to establishing a state constitution,\n                  could determine their slave status by either passing legislation to protect it or\n                  by passing legislation “unfriendly” to slavery.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:513-14; Second Debate with Stephen A.
