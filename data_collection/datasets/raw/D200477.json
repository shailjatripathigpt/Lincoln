Some regular Whigs condemned the movement\n                  for Taylor, a southern slaveholder who had no previous political affiliation, as an\n                  abandonment of Whig principles.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:275-76; Holman Hamilton,Zachary Taylor: Soldier in the White House(Hamden, CT: Archon, 1966), 63-64; Michael F.
