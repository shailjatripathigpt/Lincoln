        "text": "2A quo warranto is a writ issued to halt the exercise of an unlawfully-held office.\n                  The phrase translates literally as “by what authority”, and such a writ orders a sheriff\n                  to summon the individual  before the court to demonstrate under what authority their\n                  occupation of an office is legitimate.The quo warranto case in Sangamon County Circuit Court that Lincoln refers to wasPeople ex rel. Koerner et al. v. Ridgely et al.In 1848, GovernorAugustus C. Frenchhad appointedNicholas H. Ridgely,Uri Manley, andJohn Calhounas trustees of the remaining assets of the liquidatedState Bank of Illinois. GovernorWilliam H. Bissellsubsequently removed the men from the position of trustees in 1857 and appointed\n                  Koerner,George T. Brown, andRichard Yatesin their stead. Ridgely, Manley, and Calhoun, however, refused to relinquish their\n                  positions, and the State of Illinois, in the interest of Bissell’s appointees, retained\n                  Lincoln andWilliam H. Herndonto sue in an action of quo warranto to remove them. Stephen T. Logan was serving\n                  as one of the defense attorneys on the case, which  had initially been  called in\n                  Sangamon County Circuit Court on August 11, 1857, and continued.

It was ultimately\n                  decided in that court on November 15, 1858, in favor of the defendants. The case \n                  was  then appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court where it was heard on January 24,\n                  1859. The Supreme Court upheld the lower court’s decision, with JusticeSidney Breeseruling that the trusteeships were not technically offices and thus could not be subject\n                  to a quo warranto action.People ex rel.
