But seeing these to mind againThe lost and absent brings– The friends I left that parting day–How changed, as time has sped! Young child hood grown, strong manhood grey,And half of all are dead– I hear the lone survivors tellHow nought from death could save, Till every sound appears a knellAnd every spot a grave– I range the fields with pensive tread,I pace the hollow rooms; And feel (companion of the dead)I’m living in the tombs– A here’s an object more of dread,Than ought the grave contains– A human-form, with reason fled,While wretched life remains–3 PoorMatthew! once of genius bright,–A fortune-favored child– Now locked for aye, in mental night,A haggard mad-man wild– Poor Matthew! I have ne’er forgotWhen first with maddened will, Yourself you maimed, your father fought,And mother strove to kill; And terror spread, and neighbours ran,Your dang’rous strength to bind; And soon a howling crazy man,Your limbs were fast confined– How then you writhed and shrieked aloud,Your bones and sinnews bared; And fiendish on the gaping crowd,With burning eye-balls glared– And begged, and swore, and wept, and prayed,With maniac laughter joined– How fearful are the signs displayed,By pangs that kill the mind! And when at length, tho’ drear and long,Time soothed your fiercer woes– How plaintively your mournful song,Upon the still night rose– I’ve heard it oft, as if I dreamed,Far-distant, sweet and lone; The funeral dirge it ever seemedOf reason dead and gone– To drink it’s strains I’ve stole away,All silently and still, Ere yet the rising god of dayHad streaked the Eastern hill– Air held his breath; the trees all stillSeemed sorr’wing angels round: Their swelling tears in dew-drops fellUpon the list’ning ground– But this is past, and nought remainsThat raised you o’er the brute– Your mad’ning shrieks and soothing strainsAre like forever mute– Now fare thee well: more thou the causeThan subject now of woe. All mental pangs, by time’s kind laws,Hast lost the power to know– And now away to seek some sceneLess painful than the last– With less of horror mingled inThe present and the past– The very spot where grew the bread,That formed my bones, I see. How strange, old field, on thee to tread,And feel I’m part of thee!",

The editors have dated it the day following hislettertoAndrew Johnstonon February 24, in which Lincoln stated that his poem consisting of four cantos was\n                  “almost done.” The first ten stanzas here were sent to Johnston enclosed in aletterdated April 18, 1846. This manuscript likely represents the first two cantos of the\n                  four Lincoln mentions in the letter. On September 6, 1846, Lincoln sent a slightly\n                  differentversionof the last fourteen stanzas to Johnston. A later poem, mentioned in theletterto Johnston on September 6, 1846, and titled “The Bear Hunt,” may represent a third canto of this piece. The fourth canto is unknown. The first\n                  two cantos werepublishedanonymously in the May 5, 1847Quincy Whigunder the title “The Return.”"
