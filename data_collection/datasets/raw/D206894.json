Carley reportedly never qualified\n                  for that office following his election.Our Constitution(Urbana, IL), 7 November 1857, 2:1-3;Urbana Union(IL), 21 January 1858, 3:1; Don McCue, ed.,Treasures of the Lincoln Memorial Shrine(Redlands, CA: Watchorn Lincoln Memorial Association, 2008) 6-7; Milton W.
