Herndonon December 13, Lincoln noted that Herndon and others wanted him to “distinguish”\n                  himself, so Lincoln decided to  distinguish  himself from his peers by wading into\n                  the dispute over President James K. Polk’s justification for theMexican War. Lincoln followed up these “Spot Resolutions” with aspeechon January 12, 1848, attacking Polk’s justification for the war.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:264-65."
