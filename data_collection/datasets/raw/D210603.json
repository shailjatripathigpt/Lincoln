        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to McClun has not been located, but was likely similar to\n                  others he wrote around that time requesting his allies’ help in canvassing their Illinois\n                  General Assembly members for support of his potential candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate.  Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates. He even allowed himself to become\n                  a candidate for the Illinois General Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the\n                  election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible\n                  nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.Illinoisvoters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the Illinois General Assembly, in which\n                  Lincoln also won a seat. However, a member of the Illinois General Assembly could\n                  not run for the U. S. Senate, so in late-November 1854, Lincolndeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate.DemocratJonathan McDanielwon Lincoln’s vacated seat in theIllinois House of Representativesin the special election held on December 23, 1854. McDaniel’s victory did not help\n                  Lincoln’s cause in the election for Senate, as McDaniel cast his vote initially forJames Shieldsand later forJoel A. Matteson. Ultimately, Lincoln did not win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General\n                  Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. McClun cast his vote for Lincoln until the tenth and final ballot, when\n                  he switched to Trumbull.  See1854 Federal Election.Abraham Lincoln to Charles Hoyt;Abraham Lincoln to J.
