    "full_text": "Handbill Regarding James Adams, 5 August 1837 TO THE PUBLIC. It is well known to most of you, that there is existing,  at this time, considerable\n               excitement, in regard toGeneral Adam’stitles to certain tracts of land, and the manner in which he acquired them.  As I\n               understand, the General charges, that the whole has been gotten up by a knot of Lawyers\n               and others to injure his election;1and as I am one of the knot to which he refers, and as I happen to be in possession\n               of facts connected with the matter, I will in as brief a manner as possible make a\n               statement of them, together with the means by which I arrived at the knowledge of\n               them. Some time in May or June last,2a widow woman, by the name ofAnderson, and herson, who reside inFulton county, came toSpringfieldfor the purpose, as they said of selling  a ten acre lot of ground lying near town,3which they claimed, as the property of the deceased husband and father.— When they reached town they found the land was claimed by Gen. Adams.John T. Stuartand myself were employed to look into the matter, and if it was thought we could\n               do so with any prospect of suceess, to commence a suit for the land.4 I went immediately to the Recorder’s office to examine Adams’ title, and found that\n               the land had been entered by oneDixon,5deeded by Dixon to oneThomas,6by Thomas to oneMiller,7and by Miller to Gen. Adams.8The oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven years old, and the latest\n               more than five, all recorded at the same time, and that within less than one year.9This I thought a suspicious circumstance, and I was thereby induced to examine the\n               deeds very closely, with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to overturn\n               the title, being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud.  I finally discovered\n               that in the deed from Thomas to Miller, although Miller’s name stood in a sort of\n               a marginal note on the record book, it was no where in the deed itself.  I told the\n               fact toTalbott, the Recorder, and proposed to him that he should go to Gen. Adams’ and get the original\n               deed, and compare it with the record, and thereby ascertain whether the defect was\n               in the original, or there was merely an error in the recording.  As Talbot afterwards\n               told me, he went to the General’s, but not finding him at home, got the deed from\n               hisson, which, when compared with the record, proved what we had discovered was merely an\n               error of the Recorder.—After Mr. Talbott corrected the record, he brought the original\n               to our office, as I then thought and think yet, to show us that it was right.  When\n               he came into the room, he handed the deed to me, remarking that the fault was all\n               his own.  On opening it, another paper fell out of it, which on examination, proved\n               to be an assignment of a judgement in theCircuit Court of Sagamon County, from Joseph Anderson, the late husband of the widow above named, to James Adam’s,\n               the judgement being in favor of said Anderson against one Joseph Miller.  Knowing that this judgement had some connection with the land affair, I immediate took a copy of it, which is\n               word for word, letter for letter and cross for cross as follows: I assign all my right, title and interest to James Adams, which is in consideration\n               of a debt I owe said Adams. May 1oth, 1827. As the copy shows, it bore date May 10, 1827; although the judgement assigned by it was not obtained until the October afterwards, as may be seen by any\n               one on the records of the Circuit Court.  Two other strange circumstances attended\n               it which cannot be represented by a copy.  One of them was, that the date “1827” had\n               first been made “1837” and without the figure “3” being fully obliterated, the figure\n               “2 had” afterwards been made on top of it; the other was that, although the date was\n               ten years old, the writing on it, from the freshness of its appearance was thought\n               by many, and I believe by all who saw it, not to be more than a week old.  The paper\n               on which it was written had a very old appearance; and there were some old figures\n               on the back of it which made the freshness of the writing on the face of it, much\n               more striking than I suppose it.  otherwise might have been. The reader’s curiosity is no doubt excited to know what connection this assignment\n               had with the land in questionThe story is this: Dixon sold and deeded the land to Thomas.  Thomas sold it to Anderson;\n               but before he gave a deed, Anderson sold it to Miller and took Miller’s note for the\n               purchase money.  When this nole became due, Anderson sued Miller on it, and Miller procured an injunction from the\n               court of Chancery to stay the collection of the money until he should get a deed for\n               the land.11Gen. Adams was employed as an attorney by Anderson in this chancery suit, and at\n               the October term, 1827,12the injunction was dissolved, a judgement given in favor of Anderson against Miller; and it was provided that Thomas was to\n               execute a deed for the land in favor of Miller, and deliver it to Gen. Adams to be\n               held up by him, till Miller paid the judgement, and then to deliver it to him.  Miller left the county without paying the judgement.  Anderson moved to Fulton County, where he has since died.  When the widow came\n               to Springfield last May or June. as before mentioned, and found the land deeded to\n               Gen. Adams by Miller, she was naturally led to enquire why the money due upon the\n               judgement had not been sent to them, inasmuch as he, Gen. Adams, had no authority to deliver\n               Thomas’ deed to Miller until the money was paid.  Then it was the Gen. told her, or\n               perhaps herson, who came with her, that Anderson, in his life time,had assigned the judgement to him,  Gen. Adams.  I am now told that the General is exhibiting an assignment of the\n               same judgement bearing date “1828,” and in other respects, differing from the one\n               described;13and that he is asserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me,  ever existed;\n               or if there did, it was forged between Talbott and the lawyers, and slipped into his\n               papers, for the purpose of injuring him.—14Now I can only say that I know precisely such an one did exist, and that Ben. Talbott,Wm. Butler,C. R. Matheny[,]John T. Stuart, Judge Logan,Rober. Irwin,P.  C. Canedy, andS. M. Tinsley, all saw and examined it; and that at least one half of them will swear that IT WAS\n               IN GENERAL ADAMS’ HANDWRITING. And further, I know that Talbott will swer that he got it out of the Generel’s possession and returned it into his possession again.—The assignment which the\n               General is now exhibiting purports to have been signed by Anderson in writing.  The\n               one I copied was signed with a cross.  I am told thatGen. Neale, says that he will swear, that he heard Gen. Adam’s tell yonng Anderson that, the assignment made by his father was signed with a cross. The above are facts, as stated.  I leave them without comment.  I have given the names\n               of persons who have knowledge of these facts, in order that any one who chooses may\n               call on them  and ascertain how far they will corroborate my statements.  I have only\n               made these statements because I am known by many to be one of the individuals against\n               whom the charge of forging the assignment and slipping it into the General’s papers,\n               has been made; and because our silence might be construed into a confession of its\n               truth.  I shall not subscribe my name; but I hereby authorise the editor of theJournalto give it up to any one that may call for it.15",

        "text": "15In a reprint of the handbill in theSangamo Journal, the paper’s editorSimeon Francisissued the following statement in an adjacent column: “It having been stated this\n                  morning that the subscriber had refused to give the name of the author of the hand\n                  bill above referred to (which statement is not true): to save any farther remarks\n                  on this subject, I now state that A. Lincoln, Esq. is the author of the handbill in\n                  question. SIMEON FRANCIS August 7, 1837”Francis published not only Adams’s reply to the handbill, but also statements from\n                  Talbott, Matheny, William Butler, and Logan.Prior to the appearance of Lincoln’s handbill, there appeared in theSangamo Journalon June 17 and 24, and July 8, 15, 22, and 29, six letters signed “Sampson’s Ghost,”\n                  in which the author or authors condemned Adams for defrauding Mary Anderson out of\n                  her husband’s land. (“Sampson” was Andrew Sampson, who had leased property to Adams\n                  with the understanding that the latter would pay the property taxes and that Sampson\n                  would be allowed to reclaim the land if he compensated Adams for any improvements\n                  he might make to the land.  Adam eventually claimed the tract for himself, though\n                  it clearly belonged to Sampson.  The author conflated Sampson and Anderson.)  The\n                  author or authors also accused Adams of writing and planting letters in the Democratic\n                  press to injure Anson G. Henry, his opponent in the election for probate justice of\n                  the peace.  Given the Anderson case and the contentious circumstances surrounding\n                  the election, these letters were possibly the work of Lincoln and his colleagues Stuart,\n                  Baker, and Logan.  Charges that Lincoln made explicit in his handbill and subsequent\n                  replies to Adams’s rejoinders were more cloaked in the Sampson Ghost letters, but\n                  it is obviously that only the attorneys and their associates defending Mary and Richard\n                  Anderson would have been abreast of the evidence upon which the author or authors\n                  made their accusations and insinuations.  Some contemporaries believed that the letters\n                  originated with Lincoln alone, and some modern scholars have also assigned Lincoln\n                  sole authorship, including the editors of theThe Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition, who included the Sampson’s Ghost letters as part of the case file forWright et al. v. Adams.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, did not include them, believing that Lincoln scholars had been “somewhat precipitous\n                  in assigning Lincoln’s authorship.”  In the instance of pseudonymous or anonymous\n                  articles published in newspapers, Basler and his editors excluded all but those which\n                  they could prove were “incontrovertibly Lincoln’s.”  Adams believed the letters came\n                  from a group rather than one individual, and Basler could find no internal evidence\n                  within the  letters to determine conclusively that they came from Lincoln’s pen.Subsequent to the publication of the handbill and Lincoln’s replies to Adams’s rejoinders,\n                  theSangamo Journalon September 30 and October 7 published letters from “An Old Settler” offering evidence\n                  of Adams’s dubious character and improper conduct in a land transaction withElijah Iles.  These missives may or may not have come from Lincoln, but incontrovertible evidence\n                  to his authorship could not be found, so Basler left them out of this edition.  The\n                  editors of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln have largely followed Basler’s policy in\n                  regard to the Sampson’s Ghost letters and other pseudonymous or anonymous articles\n                  found in the press.Wright et al. v. Adamslanguished in the Sangamon County Circuit Court, the Schuyler County Circuit Court, and again in the Sangamon County Circuit Court until Adams died, whereupon the Sangamon\n                  County Circuit Court abated the case.Wright et al. v.

Adams.8The oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven years old, and the latest\n               more than five, all recorded at the same time, and that within less than one year.9This I thought a suspicious circumstance, and I was thereby induced to examine the\n               deeds very closely, with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to overturn\n               the title, being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud.  I finally discovered\n               that in the deed from Thomas to Miller, although Miller’s name stood in a sort of\n               a marginal note on the record book, it was no where in the deed itself.  I told the\n               fact toTalbott, the Recorder, and proposed to him that he should go to Gen. Adams’ and get the original\n               deed, and compare it with the record, and thereby ascertain whether the defect was\n               in the original, or there was merely an error in the recording.  As Talbot afterwards\n               told me, he went to the General’s, but not finding him at home, got the deed from\n               hisson, which, when compared with the record, proved what we had discovered was merely an\n               error of the Recorder.—After Mr. Talbott corrected the record, he brought the original\n               to our office, as I then thought and think yet, to show us that it was right.  When\n               he came into the room, he handed the deed to me, remarking that the fault was all\n               his own.  On opening it, another paper fell out of it, which on examination, proved\n               to be an assignment of a judgement in theCircuit Court of Sagamon County, from Joseph Anderson, the late husband of the widow above named, to James Adam’s,\n               the judgement being in favor of said Anderson against one Joseph Miller.  Knowing that this judgement had some connection with the land affair, I immediate took a copy of it, which is\n               word for word, letter for letter and cross for cross as follows:"

Two other strange circumstances attended\n               it which cannot be represented by a copy.  One of them was, that the date “1827” had\n               first been made “1837” and without the figure “3” being fully obliterated, the figure\n               “2 had” afterwards been made on top of it; the other was that, although the date was\n               ten years old, the writing on it, from the freshness of its appearance was thought\n               by many, and I believe by all who saw it, not to be more than a week old.  The paper\n               on which it was written had a very old appearance; and there were some old figures\n               on the back of it which made the freshness of the writing on the face of it, much\n               more striking than I suppose it.  otherwise might have been."

Thomas sold it to Anderson;\n               but before he gave a deed, Anderson sold it to Miller and took Miller’s note for the\n               purchase money.  When this nole became due, Anderson sued Miller on it, and Miller procured an injunction from the\n               court of Chancery to stay the collection of the money until he should get a deed for\n               the land.11Gen. Adams was employed as an attorney by Anderson in this chancery suit, and at\n               the October term, 1827,12the injunction was dissolved, a judgement given in favor of Anderson against Miller; and it was provided that Thomas was to\n               execute a deed for the land in favor of Miller, and deliver it to Gen. Adams to be\n               held up by him, till Miller paid the judgement, and then to deliver it to him.  Miller left the county without paying the judgement.  Anderson moved to Fulton County, where he has since died.  When the widow came\n               to Springfield last May or June. as before mentioned, and found the land deeded to\n               Gen. Adams by Miller, she was naturally led to enquire why the money due upon the\n               judgement had not been sent to them, inasmuch as he, Gen. Adams, had no authority to deliver\n               Thomas’ deed to Miller until the money was paid.  Then it was the Gen. told her, or\n               perhaps herson, who came with her, that Anderson, in his life time,had assigned the judgement to him,  Gen. Adams.  I am now told that the General is exhibiting an assignment of the\n               same judgement bearing date “1828,” and in other respects, differing from the one\n               described;13and that he is asserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me,  ever existed;\n               or if there did, it was forged between Talbott and the lawyers, and slipped into his\n               papers, for the purpose of injuring him.—14Now I can only say that I know precisely such an one did exist, and that Ben. Talbott,Wm. Butler,C. R. Matheny[,]John T. Stuart, Judge Logan,Rober. Irwin,P.  C. Canedy, andS. M. Tinsley, all saw and examined it; and that at least one half of them will swear that IT WAS\n               IN GENERAL ADAMS’ HANDWRITING. And further, I know that Talbott will swer that he got it out of the Generel’s possession and returned it into his possession again.—The assignment which the\n               General is now exhibiting purports to have been signed by Anderson in writing.  The\n               one I copied was signed with a cross.  I am told thatGen. Neale, says that he will swear, that he heard Gen. Adam’s tell yonng Anderson that, the assignment made by his father was signed with a cross."
