Haygave this undated fragment and  other short undated pieces on government and slavery\n                  the tentative date of composition of July 1, 1854. Roy P. Basler maintained this dating\n                  inThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, despite finding no evidence to support it and arguing that the fragment was likely\n                  a portion of a speech composed in 1858 or 1859, or perhaps an omitted portion of Lincoln’s\n                  September 17, 1859 speech atCincinnati. This fragment almost certainly postdates the May 30, 1854 passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand repeal of theMissouri Compromisewhich reawakened Lincoln’s interest in politics and spurred him to campaign forWhigcongressional candidateRichard Yatesin the autumn of 1854.John G.
