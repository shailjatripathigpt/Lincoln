Green and Graham signed\n                  their own names.Illinois’ 1818 constitution provided for state elections to be conductedviva voce, in which a voter would present himself in person to the election judges and declare\n                  his votes publicly. An election official would record the votes in a poll book. In\n                  1819, the First General Assembly reversed this provision in favor of voting by ballot.\n                  The legislature mandated a return toviva vocein 1821, ballots in 1823,viva voceagain in 1829, and finally settled on ballots in 1849.Ill.
