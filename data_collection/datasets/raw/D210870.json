No other correspondence\n                  between Lincoln and Hull has been located in all of 1858.At the time of this letter, Lincoln was running againstDemocraticincumbentStephen A. Douglasas theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. Both men  canvassed thestatethroughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, so  the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the1858 Federal Election. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention.On Friday, July 23, 1858, the Republicans of Illinois’ Thirty-Sixth House District\n                  nominated Daniel Stickel as their candidate for the Illinois House of Representatives.\n                  Lincoln delivered a political speech in Monticello, Illinois, just six days later.\n                  Lincoln also spoke in Monticello on September 6, as Hull requested. The turnout was\n                  indeed large—roughly 3,000 people attended. Lyman Trumbull did not speak in Monticello\n                  that day. He was scheduled to speak inChester, Illinois, on September 7.In the local elections of 1858, voters in Illinois’ Thirty-Sixth House District elected\n                  Stickel to the Illinois House. Pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois\n                  General Assembly, however, and despite Stickel and others casting their ballots for\n                  Lincoln, Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate. Through the campaign, and in particular\n                  through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 29 July 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-07-29; 6 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-06;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 30 July 1858, 2:2; 2 September 1858, 3:1; 13 November 1858, 2:3;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 9 September 1858, 1:2; John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 220, 222; Illinois HouseJournal. 1859. 21st G.
