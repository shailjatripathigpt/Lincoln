He addressed the letter to Lincoln\n                  in Clinton, Illinois, because, at the time, Lincoln was traveling throughoutIllinoisdelivering speeches in support ofRepublicancandidates for theIllinois General Assemblyand was scheduled to speak in Clinton on September 2.During the1858 Illinois Republican Convention, delegates had unanimously nominated Lincoln as theparty’s candidate for theU.S. Senate. He was running against Democratic incumbent Stephen A. Douglas. Because members\n                  of the Illinois General Assembly voted for and elected thestate’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at the time, the outcome of the races for theIllinois House of Representativesand theIllinois Senatewere critical to theSenate race. Both Lincoln and Douglas traveled extensively throughout the state during the summer\n                  and fall of 1858, speaking on behalf of candidates for thelegislaturein their respective parties.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

Lincolnrespondedto Fithian’s letter and asked that Fithian share his response with both Beckwith\n                  and Harmon. Lincoln was scheduled to speak and did speak in Danville on September\n                  22, the day after Douglas delivered a public address there. Lyman Trumbull did not\n                  speak alongside Lincoln in Danville. He was scheduled to deliver speeches inJerseyville, Illinois, on September 20 andWarsaw, Illinois, on September 25.In Illinois’s local elections of 1858, voters in the Eighteenth Illinois Senate District,\n                  which included Vermilion,Cumberland,Edgar, andColescounties, elected RepublicanThomas A. Marshall, formerly a Whig, over DemocratUsher F. Linder.  Vermilion County was also part of the Thirty-Seventh Illinois House District, and\n                  voters there elected Harmon, a Republican. In the local elections as a whole, Republicans\n                  won a majority of all votes cast in the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained\n                  control of the Illinois General Assembly and Douglas ultimately won reelection to\n                  the U.S. Senate. Marshall and Harmon both cast their ballots for Lincoln. \tThrough\n                  the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Oscar F.
