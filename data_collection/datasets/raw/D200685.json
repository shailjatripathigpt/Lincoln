None\n                  of Martin’s letters to Lincoln from this period are extant.  It appears that this\n                  involves a separate legal issue, as none of the individuals included in the telegram\n                  text presumably written by Martin on the verso were principals in the railroad cases.Alton & Sangamon RR v.

        "text": "6Martin wrote this text.  The text after the notation “one to Magher, 25.th January\n                  1851,” is presumably the telegram sent about which Martin inquired and Lincoln investigated.\n                  Martin continued to press Lincoln on the subject, and Lincoln wrote Martin two further\n                  letters,oneon July 26 andoneon July 31, relaying the results of his investigation.  The final disposition of\n                  the case is unknown.Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, speculated that “Thos Meagher” could have been Thomas F. Meagher, the Irish nationalist\n                  and served in theU.S. Armyduring the Civil War.  Meagher did not arrive in the United States until May 1852,\n                  however, and though the Springfield press hoped Meagher would visit the city during\n                  a trip toSt. Louis, there no evidence that Meagher visited Springfield or Alton.     Michael McCormack\n                  has also not been positively identified.Roy P.
