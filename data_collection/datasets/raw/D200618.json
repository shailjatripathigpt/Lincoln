        "text": "3This is a reference to Lincoln recommendingSimeon Francisfor appointment as secretary of theOregon Territory. PresidentZachary TaylorhadappointedLincoln secretary of the Oregon Territory August 9, 1849, less than a month after\n                  he appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsinIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln the position of  secretary of\n                  the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. In aletterto Secretary of State John M. Clayton dated August 21, 1849, Lincoln declined the\n                  appointment for secretary of the Oregon Territory and recommended Francis for the\n                  position instead. Lincoln reiterated his endorsement of Francis for the appointment\n                  in two other letters to Clayton in late September 1849.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Abraham Lincoln to John M. Clayton;Abraham Lincoln to John M. Clayton."

After serious consideration of this offer, Lincoln also turned\n                  this position down, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location.
