Baker and Abraham Lincoln, 12 February 18491 I am induced by surrounding circumstances to address you a few lines although I have\n               not the honor of a personal acquaintanceswith you. You are doubtless aware that for all the offices in the gift of Government\n               there are different claims and conflicting interests and there will be various petitions\n               presented. Although I am devotedly attached to theWhigcause and have for several years passed acted zealously to aid in carrying out the\n               principles of theparty; and have perhaps exerted an humble influence at the Poles[Polls].  In NorthernIllinoisyet I am not an aspirant for any office nor had I intended to advocate the claims\n               of any person for any office.  But when I learned thatJohn W Waughopof thiscitywas intending to apply for the office of Collector of this port of Chicago it struck\n               me that his would be the best appointment that could be made for that office.  There\n               are several other persons who are intending to apply for the same office and they\n               have I am informed circulated their petition generally<Page 2>and will each make the best possible effort.  I have no doubt that if Mr Waughop\n               had commenced making preperations a little sooner he could have had the influence of a majority of the Whigs in the\n               city– In proof of the last statement you will receive a number of letters from distinguished\n               Whigs who had been solicited and had signed in favor of others before knowing that\n               Mr John W Waughop was an applicant.2He is decidedly their choice and I am postively of the opinion that the appointment of Mr Waughop would give the most general satisfaction\n               of any one who could be mentioned– Mr Waughop is a gent with whom I have been acquainted\n               for a number of years and know him to be a devoted Whig and a person well qualified\n               to fill the office. Mr Waughop came to this city six years since fromTazwell Co. Ill., a young man without means and a perfect stranger and by his own industry and perseverance\n               has become a member of the Chicago Bar, and he should be countenanced and  assisted\n               & I firmly believe that his appointment would give^as^general satisfaction as any person that could be  selected,  by accomplishing this\n               appointment which I believe to be in  your power you will do very acceptable service\n               to<Page 3>the Whig friends of this section as well as rendering assistance to Real Worth you\n               will receive letters from several Gentlemen of distinction in Mr Waughop’s favor,\n               even after they had either promised their support or signed petition for others, Which\n               is positive proof of Mr Waughop’s being their first choice although Gentlemen I presume\n               there will be individuals in person atWashingtonsent on purpose to advocate the claims of others and perhaps claim something for\n               themselves and they may be Orators even, however all we ask Gents is your influence\n               in favor of a Deserving and Worthy man  and our object and the best interest of the\n               Whig Party are advanced3",
