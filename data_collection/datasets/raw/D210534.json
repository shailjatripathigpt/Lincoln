In addition to\n                  hisendorsementof Wallace and Paddock, Lincoln recommended Butler for the position in aletterto Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewingon April 7. Hurst resigned as agent in June 1849, and Wallace replaced him on June\n                  30. Wallace would hold the position until 1853.Having already failed to get Lincoln’s endorsement for a job in theU.S. General Land Office,  Butler was particularly disappointed and angry with Lincoln over Wallace’s appointment.\n                  Butler would spend the next decade opposing Lincoln’s political aspirations. The two\n                  would not speak for several years.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:295; William Jayne to William\n                     H.
