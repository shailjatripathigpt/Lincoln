Moss, and Alexander Moncrief for a seat in theIllinois House of Representatives. In the end, Grove and Henderson both won seats, with 1,440 and 1,488 votes, respectively.\n                  Moss and Moncrief, bothDemocrats, received 1,401 votes and 1,389 votes, respectively.In this letter, Grove discusses Lincoln’s candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into the election\n                  campaign in the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the\n                  Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates.  He even allowed himself\n                  to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.James M.

        "text": "5Lincoln first tackled the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia while serving\n                  in theU.S. House of Representatives.  In December 1848, RepresentativeDaniel Gottintroduced a resolution calling for the creation of a committee to report a bill\n                  prohibiting the slave trade in the District.  In January 1849, Lincoln introduced\n                  anamendmentto Gott’s resolution,  calling for a bill for abolishing slavery in the District.\n                  The House adopted Gott’s resolution, taking no action on Lincoln’s amendment.  On\n                  January 13, Lincoln gave notice of his intention to introduce a bill to abolish slavery\n                  in the District with the consent of the free white population, and with compensation\n                  to the owners.  Some aspects of Lincoln’s proposed bill matched what Grove desired\n                  in his choice for a U.S. Senator in 1854.  Ultimately, Lincoln did not introduce his\n                  bill and the House took no further action on Gott’s resolution. On January 31, however,\n                  the Committee for the District of Columbia reported abillprohibiting the introduction of slaves into the District. The House ultimately tabled\n                  this bill.  In 1861, Lincoln gave his reasons for not introducing his bill, explaining\n                  that upon “finding that I was abandoned by my former backers and having little personal\n                  influence, I dropped the matter knowing that it was useless to prosecute the business\n                  at that time.”Cong.

In theIllinois House of Representatives, the representatives selectedThomas J. Turneras speaker.  In late-November 1854, Lincoln declined to serve in the General Assembly\n                  in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, however, he  did not win election\n                  to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Grove cast his vote for Lincoln on  nine ballots before switching to Trumbull\n                  in the final ballot.  See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.
