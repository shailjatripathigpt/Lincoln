Eventually,\n                  the word became synonymous with deeds, and particularly to real property transaction\n                  deeds in which both parties assumed obligations, which is the context within which\n                  the word is used here.“Indenture,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

If her deceased\n                  husband had no children, the widow received outright ownership of one-half of the\n                  estate.With this document, Mary L.
