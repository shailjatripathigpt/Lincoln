        "text": "1On December 12, 1838, George Smith proposed a resolution, which the House rejected\n                  in an unrecorded vote. The resolution read: “Resolved, That the committee on the Judiciary\n                  be instructed to inquire into the expediency of repealing so much of the “Act concerning\n                  judgments and executions,” approved January 19th, 1825, as makes it lawful for any\n                  judgment creditor to redeem lands or tenements that may have been sold by virtue of\n                  any execution; and that they report by bill or otherwise.”“An Act concerning Judgments and Executions” provided for the sale at public auction\n                  of a defendant’s personal property to satisfy a court judgment. It allowed a defendant\n                  whose property was sold to redeem his property within twelve months of the sale by\n                  paying the purchase price plus ten percent interest. Section twelve stipulated that\n                  if a defendant failed to redeem his property, any of his judgment creditors were authorized\n                  to redeem the property under the same conditions, within fifteen months of the original\n                  sale.“An Act concerning Judgments and Executions,” 17 January 1825,Laws of Illinois(1825), 151-60; Illinois HouseJournal.  1838. 11th G.
