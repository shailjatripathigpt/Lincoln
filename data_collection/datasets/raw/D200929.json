        "text": "4Lincoln’s views notwithstanding, the localRepublicanpress denounced the article as a fraud.  Under the headline “A Bold Forgery,” theIllinois State Journalon November 14 exposed the fraud, noting that no such article appeared in theTribuneNovember 6 or any other date and, most pointedly, the November 6 edition has not\n                  arrived in Springfield, much less Petersburg, at the time theIndexprinted its November 8 edition.   TheMenard Indexapparently confessed the transgression, but theIllinois State Journalwas having none of it; under the headline “The Forgery of the Menard Index,” theJournalopined on November 25: “We by this transaction are impressed with a very poor opinion\n                  of its  honesty, and think it is not too severe to rank such deliberate forgery with\n                  theft or highway robbery.”  TheNew York Tribuneitself condemned theIndex: “We knew from the outset that the party of ‘Buchanan,BreckinridgeandFree Kansas’ would resort to fraud and even forgery to avert the doom which they had richly deserved,\n                  for we had the evidence before our eyes; but we did hope that the perpetration of\n                  these most flagrant crimes would cease with the party exigency which provoked them.\n                  In this we were mistaken.The Menard Index, aDouglasorgan inIllinois, appeared on the 7th inst. with the following barefaced and villainous forgery attributed\n                  toThe Tribune, and it has since, in spite of its palpable spuriousness, been copied into other\n                  journals of like character with that in which it originated.” TheTribunepublished the forgery in its entirety on November 22.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 14 November 1856, 2:3; 25 November 1856, 2:1; 28 November 1856, 2:1;New-York Daily Tribune(NY), 22 November 1856, 4:5-6."
