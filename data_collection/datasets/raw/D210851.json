Douglasto represent Illinois in theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both campaigned extensively\n                  and focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Douglas had spoken in Beardstown on August 11.Lincoln arrived in Beardstown on the morning of August 12 on a steamboat fromNaples. Greeted by several hundred citizens, Lincoln traveled by carriage to the National Hotel.Francis A. Arenz, John’s brother,welcomedLincoln to the town before Lincoln commenced his speech after 2 p.m. He spoke for\n                  two hours to an audience of as many as 3,000, directly addressing a charge against\n                  Douglas that theKansas-Nebraska Act—passed in 1854 and establishing popular sovereignty as a means of deciding slave\n                  status for southwestern territories—was part of a larger conspiracy to make slavery\n                  perpetual and national.The Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:1-6; Allen C.
