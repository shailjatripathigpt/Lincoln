        "text": "2At the time of this letter, John A. Logan was the pro-Stephen A. Douglascandidate for theU.S. House of RepresentativesforIllinois’s Ninth Congressional District. He stumped throughout the district during the campaign\n                  of 1858. William Joshua “Josh” Allen also supported Douglas and also delivered public\n                  speeches in support of Democratic candidates during the campaign season.During the election of 1858, some Democrats ran as pro-Douglas and others pro-Buchanan\n                  due to rifts in the Democratic Party that emerged after Douglas spoke out against\n                  theLecompton Constitutionand criticized PresidentJames Buchananfor supporting it. These pro-Douglas and pro-Buchanan factions caused considerable\n                  trouble for Douglas during the1858 Federal Election, in which he ran for reelection to theU.S. Senate. Lincoln ran as the Republican Party’s candidate to unseat him. Both men canvassed\n                  thestatethroughout the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected\n                  the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the U.S. Senate race. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.One strategy Douglas and his supporters used during the campaign in an attempt to\n                  discredit Lincoln was to claim that, during his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives,\n                  Lincoln voted against supplies for American troops fighting in theMexican War. Douglas and other Democrats insinuated that this placed American troops in greater\n                  peril and constituted Lincoln taking the enemy’s side. In reality, although Lincoln\n                  opposed the Mexican War and questioned its constitutionality during his time in the\n                  U.S. House, he nevertheless always voted in favor of supplies for U.S. troops serving\n                  in the field.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 7 September 1858, 2:3;The Salem Advocate(IL), 4 August 1858, 2:1;Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 5 October 1858, 2:3; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:265-68, 445, 454-55, 526-27;\n                     Allen C.

        "text": "3There is no record of Lincoln delivering a public address in Du Quoin, Illinois, or\n                  anywhere in Perry County, Illinois, during the campaign of 1858. Lincoln and Douglas\n                  both focused their campaign efforts on central Illinois, where the state legislative\n                  races were the closest. Perry County is in southern Illinois, which was a Democratic\n                  stronghold in 1858.Logan won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Voters in the Ninth Congressional\n                  District awarded him a strong majority of 84.2 percent of the vote. His Republican\n                  rival,David L. Phillips, won just 14.8 percent of the vote.Perry County was in the Twenty-Fourth Illinois Senate District and the Seventh Illinois\n                  House District. Democrat Elzey C. Coffey, elected  to the Illinois Senate in the Twenty-Fourth\n                  District in 1856, held over in 1858.   Voters in the Seventh Illinois House District\n                  elected DemocratJohn D. Woodto the Illinois House.Williamson County was in the Twenty-Third Illinois Senate District and the Third Illinois\n                  House District. DemocratSamuel H. Martin, elected to the Illinois Senate in the Twenty-Third District in 1856, held over in\n                  1858. Voters in the Third Illinois House District elected Democrat James D. Pulley to the Illinois House.In the local elections as a whole, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in\n                  the state, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly.\n                  When the members of the General Assembly voted on who would represent Illinois in\n                  the U.S. Senate, Coffey, Wood, Martin, and Pulley each cast their ballots for Douglas,\n                  who ultimately won reelection to the U.S. Senate.  Through the campaign, however,\n                  and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition and respect within the national Republican Party.Howard W.
