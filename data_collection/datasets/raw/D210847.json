Lincoln also apparently wroteThomas J. Pickettof Tazewell County on August 2 with a similar request for support during theelection of 1858.Lincoln had been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to represent Illinois in theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for the Illinois House of Representatives andIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the former Whig stronghold of central Illinois, where the state\n                  legislative races were the closest. Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted\n                  were those who had moved into theAmerican Partyfollowing the dissolution of the Whig Party.Thomas J.
