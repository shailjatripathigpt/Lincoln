        "text": "3Stipp references Abraham Lincoln’s campaign to succeedRichard M. Youngas commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office.  Originally,Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere among the candidates to succeed Young. Lincoln entered the competition after\n                  learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. In early June 1849, Lincoln sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting\n                  letters in support of his candidacy. Presumably, Lincoln made a similar request of\n                  Stipp, although no such letter has been located. The U.S. General Land Office was\n                  within theDepartment of the Interior, so Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing had authority over the appointment, but\n                  the final decision was in the hands of PresidentZachary Taylor, therefore some of Lincoln’s supporters addressed their letters of reference directly\n                  to Taylor.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B.
