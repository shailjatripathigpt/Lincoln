Louthan\n                  in Coles County, but released on the condition that he appear in court when summoned.\n                  After failing to appear several times, theColes County Circuit Courtrevoked his conditional release, and ordered him taken into custody. On May 1, 1850,\n                  a Coles County grand jury indicted him for murder, and Davis retainedOrlando B. Ficklin,Alexander P. Dunbar,Albert G. Jones, and Lincoln for his defense. They motioned for a change of venue, and, on July 1,\n                  1850, JusticeJustin Harlanmoved the case to the Clark County Circuit Court.  The court eventually found Davis\n                  guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to three years in theIllinois State Penitentiary.  Lincoln was one of many people to petition  GovernorJoel A. Mattesonfor Davis’s release. There is no evidence that Davis was released early.Writ of Scire, Document ID: 38889; Order, Document ID: 38885;  Writ of Capias ad Respondendum,\n                     Document ID: 38887; Judge’s Docket, Document ID: 38888; Petition for Pardon, Document\n                     ID: 54728,People v.
