Herndon, that Stephen A.\n                  Douglas would win the support of Republicans in the party stronghold of northernIllinoisby assuming a strong free soil position following his opposition to the Lecompton\n                  Constitution.Douglas had criticized the Lecompton Constitution and PresidentJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in the Democratic Party. Some Republicans\n                  were excited by Douglas’ repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution to the extent that\n                  they considered supporting his bid for reelection to the U.S. Senate in 1858. Although\n                  Douglas later denied it, he courted Republican support—meeting in person with prominent\n                  men such asHorace Greeleyand hinting in correspondence to Republicans that he was finished with the Democratic\n                  Party. Lincoln and other Republicans were concerned by these developments and urged\n                  fellow party members to remain loyal in the upcomingelection.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-50; Allen C.
