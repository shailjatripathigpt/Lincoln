        "text": "3Lincoln indeed traveled toBloomington, Illinois, where he listened to Douglas speak on the evening of Friday, July 16. When Douglas\n                  concluded his speech, the crowd  called for Lincoln to deliver a reply. He declined,\n                  stating that since the meeting was “called by the friends ofJudge Douglas. . . it would be improper for me to address it.” Lincoln delivered a campaign address\n                  in Bloomington before a mostly Republican crowd on September 4.In the end, in the local elections of 1858 Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast inIllinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate and ultimately, Douglas won reelection to the U.S.\n                  Senate. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation\n                  in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.The Daily Pantagraph(Bloomington, IL), 17 July 1858, 3:2; 6 September 1858, 2:2;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois;Report of Remarks at Bloomington, Illinois; Report of Speech at Bloomington, Illinois; Allen C.
