        "text": "5On September 13, GeerwroteLincoln another letter related to the election campaign of 1858.John C. Breckinridge wrote public letters supporting Douglas’ 1858 reelection bid,\n                  but there is no indication that he spoke in Peoria on August 17. Newspaper coverage\n                  of Douglas’ campaign address in Peoria on August 18 made no mention of Breckinridge.Lincoln delivered a speech the next day, August 19, after the adjournment of the congressional\n                  convention of the Republicans of Illinois’ Fourth Congressional District. During that\n                  convention, delegates unanimously nominatedWilliam Kelloggas their candidate for the district’s seat in theU.S. House of Representatives. Kellogg addressed the crowd after Lincoln.In the local elections of 1858, Kellogg won election to the U.S. House of Representatives\n                  with 52.8 percent of the vote compared to his pro-Douglas Democratic rivalJames W. Davidson‘s 45.7 percent, and the 1.5 percent that his pro-Buchanan Democratic opponent, Jacob Gale, won. In the races for theIllinois General Assembly, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly\n                  voted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas\n                  ultimately won reelection. Through the campaign, however, and in particular through\n                  his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Daily Illinois State Register(Springfield), 21 July 1858, 2:1; 23 August 1858, 2:3;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 19 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-19;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 21 August 1858, 2:3; 27 September 1858, 2:2;Summary of Speech at the Congressional Convention of the Fourth District, Peoria,\n                        Illinois; Howard W.
