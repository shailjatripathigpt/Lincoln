The Senate passed the bill as\n                  amended on February 7.

The first proviso proscribed that if the commissioners appointed to locate the\n                  county seat of Menard chose a location on the west or left side of theSangamon river, then, and in that case, the lines of said county would be changed from those described\n                  in section one of thebill.   What Lincoln proposed to strike out reads as follows: “Beginning at the South\n                  West corner of section thirty four in Township Eighteen North of Range Six West; thence\n                  North 3 miles.”"
