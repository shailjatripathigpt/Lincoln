Douglas was the incumbent and Lincoln was theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate. For a time, Lincoln followed Douglas on the campaign trail, delivering\n                  speeches either later in the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. On July\n                  24, Lincoln challenged Douglas to a series of formal debates. Douglas agreed, and\n                  these became theLincoln-Douglas Debates.

Between September 22 and 24, he delivered campaign speeches inDanvilleandUrbanainstead. At the time, the northern counties of Illinois—such as Winnebago—were a\n                  Republican stronghold. Both Lincoln and Douglas focused their 1858 campaigns on central\n                  Illinois.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, but pro-DouglasDemocratsretained control of theIllinois General Assembly. Members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in the U.S. Senate and, in the federal election of 1858, Douglas won reelection. Through\n                  the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas\n                  Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican\n                  Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, September,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=9; Allen C.
