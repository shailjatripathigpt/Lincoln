Rugg, heard before  JudgeThomas Drummond, lasted just four days.  The jury ruled for the plaintiff and awarded Haines $2,300\n                  in damages. Rugg appealed this decision to theU.S. Supreme Court, in the caseRugg v. Haines. Lincoln represented Haines until he was elected president in the1860 Federal Election.Rugg v. Hainescommenced December 9, 1862. On December 15, 1862, JusticeRoger B. Taneyupheld the lower court’s decision and awarded Haines $2,300 in damages as well as\n                  costs expended in the suit.In July 1858, Haines also suedWait Talcott, along with the other surviving representatives ofManny and Company, in a separate case for infringement upon his reaper patent.
