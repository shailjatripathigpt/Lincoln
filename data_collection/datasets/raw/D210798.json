        "text": "3Lincoln had recently been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhig Partystronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted were those who had moved into the\n                  American Party following the dissolution of the Whig Party and Lincoln and Douglas\n                  attempted to win over former supporters of Fillmore.During the course of the1858 election campaignLincoln spoke in at least two communities in Eureka’s home county ofWoodford. He gave an impromptu speech in El Paso, Illinois on August 28, 1858 when a crowd\n                  gathered as he waited at the train station, and delivered another speech inMetamoraon October 4. Although Woodford County was one of the counties where the Whig Party\n                  had formerly been dominant, at the time of the 1858 election it was in the Eighth\n                  Illinois Senate District and the Forty-Second Illinois House of Representatives District,\n                  both of which  contained a mix of counties that had historically supported Whigs and\n                  counties where theRepublican Partywas now strong. Despite coming in second in Woodford County in the election of 1858,\n                  the Republican candidates for Illinois Senate and House of Representatives both ultimately\n                  won a majority in their districts and were elected.

Cook in the Forty-Second Illinois House District,\n                  with a 453-vote advantage inMarshallandPutnamcounties, which Cook’s 336-vote lead in Woodford County could not overcome.Allen C.

During the course of the 1858 campaign, Lincoln refuted rumors that he had been\n                  a member of the American Party in an October 1858 speech atMeredosiaas well as in a letter to Edward Lusk later that same month. Similar rumors also surfaced during the1860 presidential electionand Lincoln again denied any affiliation with the American Party.Abraham Jonas to Abraham Lincoln; Abraham Lincoln to Abraham Jonas."
