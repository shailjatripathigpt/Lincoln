This telegram has not been located. Since Lincoln was inTremont, Illinoisat the time, on September 23 he wrote aletterto Ewing explaining that he had asked a friend in Springfield to send Ewing a telegram\n                  informing him that Lincoln respectfully declined the appointment.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 20 September 1849,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1849-09-20; 25 September 1849,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1849-09-25."

However,John T. Stuartlater stated that Lincoln discussed the appointment with him and also wroteJoshua Speedabout the position. In addition,Anson G. Henrywrote Ewing a letter on September 24, 1849 noting that although Lincoln declined\n                  the position, he remained loyal to the administration. Henry, therefore, must also\n                  have learned about the appointment sometime before Ewing received word that Lincoln\n                  had declined it.Since Ewing did not hear back from Lincoln, he sent anothertelegramto Springfield on September 25, asking for a reply to PresidentZachary Taylor’s offer of the governorship appointment.Michael Burlingame, ed.,An Oral History of \n                        Abraham Lincoln: John G.

        "text": "4In thetelegramLincoln sent Ewing the same date as this letter, he reiterated that he declined appointment\n                  as governor of the Oregon Territory but that he hoped the Taylor administration would\n                  appointSimeon Francissecretary of the territory. Prior to offering Lincoln appointment as governor of\n                  the Oregon Territory, the Taylor administration had also offered Lincoln appointment\n                  as secretary of the Oregon Territory, an appointment which Lincoln also declined but\n                  immediately recommended Francis for instead. The administration offered Lincoln both\n                  Oregon positions soon after Taylor appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both  Taylor and Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln a political\n                  appointment in the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and\n                  prevent additional attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. Lincoln  seriously considered\n                  accepting the governorship of the Oregon Territory, but ultimately declined the position,\n                  at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location.In the end, Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory and Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory. Francis’ name does not appear in the official\n                  registers of the officers and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,\n                  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did not receive any other appointment during this\n                  period. The 1861 official register shows Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment either, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Appointment of Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Territory of Oregon;Abraham Lincoln to John M.
