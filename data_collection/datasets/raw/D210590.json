        "text": "2Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Abraham Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first).  As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  and the possibility that a newly-elected General Assembly might oust incumbent U.S.\n                  SenatorDemocratJames Shields increased, Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee\n                  for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate seats. In November and December 1854, Lincoln\n                  wrote confidential letters to political allies, including Charles Hoyt onNovember 10, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.On November 27, HoytwroteLincoln that he had asked Gibson to speak with Benjamin Hackney as well as Kane County’s\n                  other recently-elected representatives in theIllinois General Assembly, Augustus Adams and William Patten, to ascertain whether they would support Lincoln\n                  as a candidate for the U.S. Senate.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

As Gibson indicates, this position became untenable for some Whigs\n                  after passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.  See the1852 Federal Election.Michael F.

Adams cast seven ballots for Lincoln before switching his vote to Trumbull.\n                  Hackney shifted his allegiance back and forth from Lincoln toMartin P. SweetandJ.

Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln, 1:401-2; David Herbert Donald,Lincoln, 185; Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G.
