        "text": "1This transcription is entirely inAbraham Lincoln’s handwriting.  Evidence suggests that Lincoln copied this treaty  for use in hisspeechon theMexican Wardelivered in theHouse of Representativeson January 12, 1848. Lincoln’shandwritten versionof the speech does not include this transcription, but it does appear as an appendix\n                  in theversionpublished as a pamphlet byJ. & G. S. Gideon.  It is also affixed as an appendix to the version published in theCongressional Globe.  It was one of two treaties signed by Mexico and the new Republic of Texas. A second\n                  treaty was secretly arranged withSanta Anna, ensuring that he would recognize Texas’ independence if David G. Burnet agreed to\n                  release him from captivity.Internal evidence from both the handwritten and printed versions of Lincoln’s speech\n                  suggests that he copied this treaty fromNiles’ Weekly Register.  Except for some minor differences in punctuation, Lincoln duplicates the version\n                  of the treaty fromNiles’ Weekly Register, including  transcribing the letter “C” instead of the letter “G” as David G. Burnet’s\n                  middle initial.  The original handwritten treaty is housed at the Texas State Archives\n                  and Library Commission.Dating this transcription is problematic.Niles’ Weekly Registerpublished the treaty on July 16, 1836; Lincoln could have made a copy anytime from\n                  July 1836 to January 1848.  Given that Lincoln’s speech came in response to PresidentJames K. Polk’sannual messageread beforeCongresson December 7, 1847, the editors believe that he transcribed the speech sometime\n                  between that date and the date of the speech.Cong. Globe, 30th Cong., 1st Sess., Appendix, 95 (1848);Niles’ Weekly Register(Baltimore, MD), 16 July 1836, 336:1; “The Treaty of Velasco (public),” 14 May 1836,\n                     Archives and Information Services Division, Texas State Library and Archives Commission,\n                     Austin, Texas.,https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/velasco-public-1.html."

        "text": "3This agreement was part of the aftermath of the Texas Revolution of 1836.     On April\n                  21, 1836, Texas forces routed Santa Anna and his army at the Battle of San Jacinto,\n                  and on April 22, the Texans took Santa Anna prisoner.  On May 14, Santa Anna signed\n                  two treaties, one public and one private, which together became known as the Treaty\n                  of Velasco.  In the public treaty, which Lincoln transcribes here, Santa Anna agreed\n                  to end hostilities, and in the private and confidential agreement he agreed to work\n                  to persuade the Mexican government to accept Texan independence.  In exchange for\n                  these treaties, the Texans agreed to free Santa Anna and allow him to return to Mexico.\n                  The Mexican Government, however, repudiated the public agreement, arguing that it\n                  was invalid because Santa Anna was a prisoner when it was concluded.Will Fowler,Santa Anna of Mexico(Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2007), 171-73, 175, 176, 177-81."
