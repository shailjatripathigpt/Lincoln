        "text": "2In November and December 1839, Abraham Lincoln helped organize a series of debates\n                  inSpringfieldbetween the Democrats and Whigs in anticipate of theupcoming presidential election. Lincoln,Cyrus Walker, andEdward D. Bakercarried the Whig standard;Stephen A. Douglas,John Calhoun,Josiah Lamborn, andEdmund R. Wileyspoke on behalf of the Democrats. The first debate occurred on November 19, coinciding\n                  with a session of theSangamon County Circuit Court, which brought many politicians of both parties to Springfield. Debates occurred\n                  nightly for one week. Lincoln closed the debate on November 19, and the next night,\n                  Lincoln and Douglas debated theBank of the United States. \n                  After theWhig National ConventionnominatedWilliam Henry Harrisonfor president, Lincoln took charge of Harrison’s campaign inIllinois. Coinciding with the Whig National Convention, politicians gathered for a special\n                  session of theGeneral Assembly.After a brief hiatus, the debates resumed during the week of Christmas.  After Lincoln\n                  spoke on December 18, Douglas offered a rebuttal, which Baker answered.  Lincoln culminated\n                  his attack on the  Sub-Treasury with aspeechon December 26.Illinois State Register(Springfield), 23 November 1839, 2:2; 30 November 1839, 2:3;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 22 November 1839, 2:4, 3 January 1840, 4:1-2; Paul M.
