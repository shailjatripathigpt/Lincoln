        "text": "4Lincoln had been actively working to advance Taylor’s candidacy as a member of the\n                  so-called “Young Indians,” a Whig Executive Committee founded byTruman Smithin the spring of 1847 to provide the Whig Party with a unified national organization\n                  for the imminent presidential campaign.  Including principally but not exclusively\n                  Southern Whigs, the Young Indians made it their goal to nominate Zachary Taylor as\n                  the Whig Party standard bearer in 1848.Some Whigs condemned the movement for Taylor, a southern slaveholder who had no\n                  previous political affiliation, as an abandonment of Whig principles.  Taylor’s insistence\n                  on an independent candidacy, independent of party, further eroded his following among\n                  the party faithful, allowing Winfield Scott, John McLean, and other candidates to\n                  get attention.  This included Henry Clay, the party’s standard bearer in the1844 electionand was still the nominal head of the party.  To dispel rumors that he was withdrawing\n                  from the race, Clay released a public letter--the letter Lincoln references--announcing\n                  his intention to allow the upcoming Whig National Convention to consider him as a\n                  candidate.  Written on April 10 and distributed toLexington, Kentuckynewspapers on April 12 and major eastern newspapers the next day, Clay’s letter incensed\n                  Taylor’s followers, prompting them to urge him to issue a statement affirming his\n                  commitment to Whig principles.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:275-76; Holman Hamilton,Zachary Taylor: Soldier in the White House(Hamden, CT: Archon, 1966), 63-64; Michael F.
