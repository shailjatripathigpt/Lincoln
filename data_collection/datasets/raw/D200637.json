Lockwoodfor the same office,3I mean not to abate in the least my recommendation of Judge Logan, when I say that\n               Judge Lockwood too is most worthy of such an appointment. His moral worth, and legal\n               ability are above all question– For about twentyfive years he was a judge of our Supreme Court; and his opinions, extending through nearly all our books of Reports, are a sufficient\n               guaranty of his capacity, to all who may not personally know him– His appointment,\n               I think, would give very general satisfaction–4",
