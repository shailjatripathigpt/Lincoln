Resolved, That theWhigsofIllinoisrespond to the nomination ofHenry Clayas the Whig candidate for the Presidency, by the Whig National Convention, with an\n               enthusiasm only equalled by that which it was made; that the great statesman of the\n               West commands not only our admiration, for his brilliant and eminently practical talents,\n               our respect and gratitude for his invaluable and ever patriotic services to our country,\n               but the warmest and deepest feelings of our hearts for the noble and generous qualities\n               so pecullarly characteristic of our gallantHarry of the West.1 Resolved, That inTheodore Frelinghuysen, the nominee of the vice-presidency, we recognize an  able and eloquent advocate\n               of Whig principles, a statesman whose talents have given lustre to our national councils, a man whose pure life and active philanthropy commend him\n               to the esteem of every good citzen, and who, in all the varied relations of life through which he has passed, has shown\n               himself to be “without fear and without reproach.” Resolved, therefore, That the Whigs of Illinois in Convention assembled, hereby cordially\n               ratify and confirm the nominations of the Whig National Convention, and pledge themselves\n               to use all honorable efforts to insure their favorable reception and ratification\n               at the polls in November next. Resolved, That thus responding to the nomination ofHenry Clayfor the Presidency, we hereby cordially adopt and affirm the principles which have\n               guided, and have been so proverbially illustrated by that great man, in his long and\n               brilliant carrer[career] as an American Statesman. That foremost in importance among those principles we recognize and affirm, that of\n               providing a national revenue by a tariff of duties on foreign importations, so adjusted\n               that while it will yield no more than is necessary for an economical and efficient\n               administration of the federal government, will at the same time afford equal protection\n               and encouragement to every branch of American Industry. That, next in importance, in its effects upon the interests and welfare of the whole\n               country, we regard the plan of distributing the proceeds of the public lands among\n               the several States, as well on account of its intrinsic justice and expediency, as\n               of its tendency to produce uniformity and stability in our National Legislation in\n               regard to the revenue. That the establishment of a sound currency, the practical restriction of the veto\n               power, so that it may not be wielded to the centralization of all power in the hands\n               of a corrupt and despotic Executive; the limitation of the presidential office to\n               one term; the non-interference of all officers of the government as such, in elections;\n               an economical, faithful and impartial administration of the government—and reform\n               of all those abuses which have sprung out of the corrupt use of the power of appointments,\n               are also objects which claim our approval, and challenge our untiring efforts to secure\n               their accomplishments. That the Whigs of Illinois, although often beaten in their political battles, have\n               never yet been conquered, and that at theidesof November next, at the polls, we will fall into the phalanx of the Whig States,\n               with a majority that shall show that in “every  peril”the Suckersare willing to “divide the danger.”2 Letters were then read from several distinguished gentlemen, who had been invited\n               to attend.  Among others, one fromHenry Clay, another fromMillard Fillmore, ofN.Y.,Francis Granger, ofdo., and others, declining to attend, from the great distance, and other engagements. Speeches were then the order of the day, andUriel Wright, Esq.[Esquire], ofSt. Louiswas called to the stand, and for more than an hour, he enchained the attention of\n               the thousands present, with a speech, in most excellent taste, filled with political\n               truths, amusing anecdotes applicable to the times and parties, and convincing and\n               unanswerable argument.  Next in order wasD. M.Woodson, Esq., candidate forCongressin this district.  He excused himself in a short speech, by remarking that he was\n               on a canvass of the district, and should visit every county of the same and publicly\n               address the people.E. D.Baker, Esq., was next called out, and made one of his best speeches.  To speak of the merits\n               of this gentleman as a speaker, would be out of place here, as he is so well known\n               and so universally admired, that we could add  nothing in his praise.M. P.Sweet, candidate for Congress in the Sixth District, was next called to the stand, and\n               although a new man down this way, his speech drew forth long and loud plaudits from\n               the people. Mr.Morrison, Esq., ofSt. Clair, was next called out, and though quite a youth in appearance, his words were those\n               of wisdom and experience.Ben Bond, Esq., ofClinton, was next in order, and made a speech in his characteristic, forcible, cut and thrust\n               manner.  The Convention then adjourned, until after supper, when Mr.A.Lincoln, ofSpringfield, made an able argument in defence of whig principles.  He was followed byDr. McDowell,3D. J.Baker,Jos.Gillaspie, and we believe others.  Mr. E. S.Austin,4also occupied the stand, in singing some of his favorite whig songs.  During the\n               afternoon and evening, the immense crowds in the streets, were addressed byDr.Vandevener, ofBrown,Kilpatrick, ofScott, andJohn H. Mitchell, Esq., ofWarrenand others whose names are unknown to us. The Convention adjourned around 12 o’clock in the best harmony and good feeling, and\n               with a firm determination to do all that good whigs can do, to redeem Illinois from\n               the power of apartythat has for years borne down her giant energies, and frittered away those means\n               and advantages, which in better hands, and with wiser councils, would have elevated\n               our State to the highest point of greatness and prosperity.",
