        "text": "3In November 1849, Lincoln had sent the previous secretary of the interior, Ewing,\n                  atelegramrecommending Simeon Francis for appointment as surveyor general of theOregon Territory. Ewing hadreplied, noting that such a position had not yet been created, but probably would be soon.\n                  After President Fillmore replaced Ewing with McKennan, Lincoln sent McKennan aletterreasserting his desire that Francis receive the position.Prior to recommending Francis for this position, Lincoln had also recommended him\n                  for secretary of the Oregon Territory, a position Taylor awarded Lincoln on August\n                  9, 1849, but which Lincoln declined. OtherIllinoisWhigsalso pressed for Francis to receive the secretary appointment, but Taylor ultimately\n                  appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory.TheU.S. Congressdid not pass legislation creating the office of surveyor general of the Oregon Territory\n                  until September 27, 1850, and the first person appointed to the position was John\n                  B. Preston. Francis’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers\n                  and agents of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently,\n                  he did not receive any other appointment during this period. The 1861 official register\n                  shows Francis worked in Oregon as a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster\n                  for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment either, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Sylvia Larson, “McKennan, Thomas McKean Thompson,”American National Biography, ed. by John A.
