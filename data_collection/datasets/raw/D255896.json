V.\n                  Owen & Brother toMiller & Holbrookand leaving the arrangement of T. J. V. Owen & Brother’s debt repayment in Lincoln’s\n                  hands. Lincoln and Blatchford, Seward & Griswold subsequently exchanged at least three\n                  more letters related to this debt. Lincoln advised the firm against initiating a lawsuit\n                  to resolve the matter, but it is unclear from extant correspondence whether he was\n                  able to resolve the debt either in full or in part.Blatchford, Seward, and Griswold to Abraham Lincoln; Abraham Lincoln to Blatchford, Seward & Griswold; Blatchford, Seward & Griswold to Abraham Lincoln."
