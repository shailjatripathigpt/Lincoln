        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln had been nominated on June 16 at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. Douglas returned home to Illinois following the close of a special session of the\n                  U.S. Senate, which ended  on June 16, 1858. The unnamed farmer quoted by Usrey was\n                  apparently in part complaining that Douglas had been able to begin his campaign for\n                  the U.S. Senate on a stronger note than Lincoln because his supporters orchestrated\n                  receptions for him in his capacity as returning U.S. Senator which were campaign events\n                  in disguise.  Republican newspapers also challenged the pretense that these were spontaneous\n                  receptions by Douglas’ grateful constituents and implied that Douglas was financing\n                  the events.As this letter suggests, Lincoln followed Douglas closely during these early campaign\n                  events. Douglas was received with fanfare upon his arrival inChicago, where he delivered a speech to his supporters on July 9. Lincoln, having attended\n                  Douglas’s speech, responded with one of his own the following  day. Douglas next made\n                  appearances inBloomingtonandAtlanta, Illinois, on July 16 and 17, with Lincoln attending both speeches, but declining\n                  calls to speak after Douglas. Also on July 17, Douglas gave a speech in a grove in\n                  Springfield, and Lincoln responded with a speech at the state house in Springfield\n                  later in the evening. In his Springfield speech Lincoln suggested that Douglas had\n                  an advantage over him not only because he was the incumbent senator, but becauseDemocratic Partyleaders were eager to hold marches, triumphal entries, and receptions in Douglas’\n                  honor because they were also looking ahead to his potential candidacy in thepresidential election of 1860. Illinois Republican leaders had encouraged Lincoln to follow Douglas to his receptions\n                  around the state in this manner, but following complaints by Douglas and other Democrats\n                  about this tactic, in early August, 1858 Lincoln declined further invitations to appear\n                  at Douglas’ scheduled events.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:2-6; 9 July 1858, 2:1; 15 July 1858, 3:1; 21 July\n                     1858, 2:1;Cong.
