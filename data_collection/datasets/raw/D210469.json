        "text": "2This letter represented the culmination of a lengthy battle over who would succeed\n                  Richard S. Updike as postmaster--a battle in which Abraham Lincoln became embroiled.\n                  David Roberts andAlanson Stockwellwere the original frontrunners for the job.  Lincoln recommended one of the two to\n                  the Post Office Department, but then he began receiving letters opposing both Stockwell\n                  and Roberts and suggestingJohn H. Ballas an alternative.  With Tremonters at odds over which candidate they preferred,\n                  Lincoln was forced to write the Post Office Department and ask that if the appointment\n                  was not already made, to suspend it until the town could unify around one candidate.\n                  On April 21, LincolnwroteWilliam  D. Briggsoffering advice on how to handle the vexing problem.  Lincoln advised Briggs “to\n                  get up a full and fair meeting” of theWhigsand, if he thought fit,Democratsof the area to decide who would become postmaster.  This meeting occurred on April\n                  28, and Roberts received the majority of support.Lincoln himself preferred Roberts and recommended him for the position.  Roberts \n                  held the job until 1860.Petition of Richard T. Gill and Others to Abraham Lincoln;Mary L. Perkins to Abraham Lincoln;Fitz Henry Warren to Abraham Lincoln;John M.
