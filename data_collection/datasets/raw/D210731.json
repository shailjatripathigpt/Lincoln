        "text": "2Lucas is discussing canvassing related to Illinois’s local elections of 1858, which\n                  had a bearing on the1858 Federal Election. Voters in Illinois were set to elect members of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s representatives\n                  in theU.S. Senate, so  the races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the race for the U.S. Senate. Just one day\n                  after Lucas wrote this letter, delegates to the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionunanimously selected Abraham Lincoln as the party’s candidate to supplant Democratic\n                  incumbent Stephen A. Douglas in the U.S. Senate. During the summer and fall of 1858,\n                  both Lincoln and Douglas canvassed the state, delivering speeches in support of candidates\n                  for the General Assembly in their respective parties.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

        "text": "3Lucas references a speech Douglas gave in the U.S. Senate on June 15. In the speech,\n                  Douglas argued that a June 9 gathering of Illinois members of the Democratic Party\n                  was not a legitimate Democratic convention and was instead a gathering of “bolters”\n                  from the Democratic Party. He  asserted that the authentic 1858 Illinois Democratic\n                  Convention was held April 21, and that the delegates to that convention endorsed him\n                  as the legitimate Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate. Douglas furthermore accused\n                  the “bolters” of being “in a secret alliance with the leaders of the Republican Party,”\n                  claiming thatCharles Leibwas acting on behalf of the Republican Party and pressuring Democratic postmasters\n                  throughout Illinois to back Lincoln over Douglas for U.S. senator in the upcomingelection of 1858. Douglas claimed that Leib was pressuring Democratic postmasters to withdraw their\n                  support from Douglas by insinuating that any who supported Douglas would be removed\n                  from their posts by PresidentJames Buchanan.Douglas was correct that the Democratic Party  held its official state convention\n                  in Springfield, Illinois, on April 21. Tensions were high within the party due to\n                  President Buchanan’s recent support of theLecompton Constitutionand Douglas’ denunciation of the constitution as well as Buchanan. Pro-Buchanan delegates\n                  bolted the April convention and held their own convention on June 9, during which\n                  they strongly denounced Douglas.To Douglas’s other charge, although it is unclear whether a formal alliance ever existed\n                  between Leib and his pro-Buchanan political allies and the Illinois Republican Party,\n                  Leib was outspoken in his disdain for Douglas and actively promoted pro-Buchanan interests\n                  within the Illinois Democratic political establishment—including among patronage appointees\n                  such as postmasters. Moreover, in the aftermath of the controversy regarding the Lecompton\n                  Constitution, President Buchanan did, in fact, purge many Douglas supporters from\n                  federal patronage appointments throughout Illinois as part of a concerted effort to\n                  politically punish Douglas for his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution and public\n                  criticism of Buchanan.Lincoln almost certainly would have heard about Douglas’s June 15 speech in the U.S.\n                  Senate by the time he received this letter from Lucas. On June 16,Lyman TrumbullalsowroteLincoln a letter about Douglas’s speech. In a June 23replyto Trumbull, Lincoln stated that he had seen a telegraph report “of Douglas’ general\n                  onslaught upon every body but himself.” On June 24, theDaily Illinois State Registerreported that it had received a copy of Douglas’s speech in pamphlet form and, on\n                  June 25, the paper reprinted a full copy of the speech for its readers. Other papers\n                  in Illinois also covered the speech and printed excerpts.Cong.

It is no less singular than true, that almost every political move\n               that is being made in Illinois, however trivial, is knownherein certain quarters.  Club rooms, for almost every state are in full blast— conducted\n               principally, by the clerks of the different States.6Illinois^clubclub^at present has suspended operations.
