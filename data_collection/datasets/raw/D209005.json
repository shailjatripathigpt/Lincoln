        "text": "2In June 1858, theIllinois Republican Conventionnominated Abraham Lincoln to challenge Stephen A. Douglas for theU.S. Senate. Lincoln wrote Douglas on July 24, 1858, inviting him to participate in aseries of debates. That invitation set the stage for what would become one of the most famous local\n                  political contests in U.S. history and a precursor to the1860 presidential election. Prior to the seven debates between Lincoln and Douglas, Lincoln had already made\n                  sixty-three speeches in 1858, and Douglas claimed to have made 130. Douglas, the incumbentU.S. SenatorfromIllinois, was more widely known than Lincoln and had the numeric advantage of theDemocratsin theGeneral Assembly. He also represented a divided party and faced a growing population in northern Illinois\n                  that was hostile to slavery. Lincoln, on the other hand, had the advantage of a unitedRepublicanparty, a growing antipathy toward slavery in thestate, and a reputation for integrity. Nevertheless, his views on racial issues were unpopular,\n                  as was his stand on theMexican War. The debates would highlight the fundamental differences in the men’s characters\n                  and focus on the main issues of the day, the expansion of slavery and racial equality.\n                  While the immediate effect of the debates was the reelection of Douglas, the long-term\n                  results were the opposite. Lincoln was catapulted to national prominence, allowing\n                  him to run for president in 1860, and Douglas’s campaign against Lincoln diminished\n                  his chances of future success. See1860 Republican National Convention.Douglasrepliedto Lincoln’s invitation on the same day, July 24, agreeing to the debates as long\n                  as they were held at times and locations chosen by Douglas.
