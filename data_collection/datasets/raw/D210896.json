When the Tazewell County Republican convention\n                  was held inTremonton August 30, 1858, Richard N. Cullom was selected as the party’s candidate for the\n                  race. Cullom ultimately received 1,783 votes in the election, losing toDemocratRobert B. M. Wilson, who earned 1,955 votes.Because theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate at this time, the races for\n                  theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere important to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their campaign\n                  efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of centralIllinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.John Clayton, comp.,The Illinois Fact Book and Historical Almanac 1673-1968(Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), 220, 222;Summary of Speech at Tremont, Illinois;Summary of Speech at Tremont, Illinois;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 4 November 1858, 3:2;The Weekly Chicago Times(IL), 11 November 1858, 2:5; Allen C.

In making his allegation, Douglas mistakenly quoted a more radical\n                  platform passed at a Republican meeting in Aurora that same year rather than the actual\n                  Springfield platform. In his debate response, Lincoln denied having assisted in composing\n                  the Springfield platform, not realizing that Douglas was quoting the incorrect platform.The second curse/socially unacceptable word redacted by Davis here is uncertain.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:490-92; First Debate with Stephen A.
