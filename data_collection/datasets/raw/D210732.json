The Thirty-FifthU.S. Congresswas set to adjourn when President James Buchanan sent the members of Congress a message\n                  on the morning of Saturday, June 12 recommending that they postpone adjourning their\n                  ongoing session until appropriation bills then under consideration were passed and\n                  the condition of theU.S.  Treasurywas assessed and secured. The first session of the Thirty-Fifth Congress eventually\n                  adjourned on Monday, June 14. That day, however, President Buchanan issued a proclamation\n                  declaring that an “extraordinary occasion” required the U.S. Senate to convene for\n                  a special session on June 15. The Senate convened for the special session on Tuesday,\n                  June 15 and adjourned Wednesday, June 16.Cong. Globe, 35th Cong., First Sess., 2981, 3048-50 (1858);Cong.

Despite Stephen\n                  A.

Tensions\n                  were high within the party due to President Buchanan’s recent support of theLecompton Constitutionand Douglas’s denunciation of the constitution as well as Buchanan. Pro-Buchanan\n                  delegates bolted the April convention and held their own convention on June 9, during\n                  which they strongly denounced Douglas. Douglas, in turn, denounced this pro-Buchanan\n                  “bolter” convention, asserting that it was not a legitimate Democratic political convention.Cong.

Douglas claimed Leib was insinuating that any Democratic postmasters who supported\n                  Douglas would be removed from their posts by President Buchanan.Although it is unclear whether a formal alliance ever existed between Leib and his\n                  pro-Buchanan political allies and Lincoln, specifically, or the Illinois Republican\n                  Party in general, Leib was outspoken in his disdain for Douglas and actively promoted\n                  pro-Buchanan interests within the Illinois Democratic political establishment—including\n                  among patronage appointees such as postmasters. Furthermore, in the aftermath of the\n                  controversy regarding the Lecompton Constitution, President Buchanan did, in fact,\n                  purge many Douglas supporters from federal patronage appointments throughout Illinois\n                  as part of a concerted effort to politically punish Douglas for his opposition to\n                  the Lecompton Constitution and public criticism of Buchanan.William Herndonclaimed that some Republicans encouraged factionalism among Democrats but deliberately\n                  kept Lincoln ignorant of such efforts. Douglas claimed that John Wentworth hoped to\n                  replace him as U.S. Senator for Illinois in the upcoming election of 1858. Douglas\n                  and his supporters, including the editors of theChicago Times, also promoted rumors that Wentworth publicly supported Lincoln’s candidacy for the\n                  U.S. Senate in exchange for Lincoln’s support for Wentworth becoming the next governor\n                  of Illinois. Lincoln denied these rumors and stated that he believed that Wentworth’s\n                  public support for his candidacy for the U.S. Senate was genuine.Cong.
