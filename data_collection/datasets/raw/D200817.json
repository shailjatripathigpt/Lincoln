At a meeting of the members of the bar, held at the court house, in thiscity, on Wednesday,Nov. 29, during the present term of theSangamon circuit court, Hon.Stephen T. Loganwas called to the chair, andW. J.Blackappointed secretary. Mr.B. S. Edwardsstated the object of the meeting to be to pay a tribute of respect to the memory\n               ofCharles R. Welles, deceased, late a member of the bar, and moved that a committee, to consist of three\n               members of the bar, be appointed to draft and present resolutions suitable to the\n               occasion. The chair appointedJames C. Conkling, esq.[esquire], Hon.John T. Stewartand Hon.A. Lincolnas said committee. The committee, by Mr. Conkling, their chairman, reported the following resolutions,\n               which were unanimously adopted: Whereas, since the last term of our circuit court2Charles R. Welles suddenly terminated his mortal career under an attack of that fearful\n               scourge, the cholera, which has desolated the hearts and homes of unnumbered thousands—3 Resolved, That by his death the bar ofSpringfieldhas lost a highly esteemed, upright and honorable member of the legal profession. Resolved, That his strict integrity, his social character and christian virtues endeared him\n               to his friends, secured the confidence of his acquaintances, and rendered him a useful\n               member of society. Resolved, That we deeply sympathise with his family and friends in their bereavement, but in the midst of their affliction\n               we doubt not they experience consolation in the assurance that their loss is his eternal\n               gain. Resolved, That a copy of these proceedings be presented to thewidowand family of the deceased, and to his honor,Judge Davis, of the circuit court, with a request that they may be enrered[entered] at full upon the records of the court, and that the city papers be requested to publish\n               the same. On motion of Mr.Thos. G. Taylor, Mr. B. S. Edwards was requested to present these proceedings to the circuit court. On motion, the meeting adjourned. W. J.Black,Sec’y[Secretary]. Upon presenting the proceedings to the court, Mr.Edwardssaid: May it please the court:As the representative of the bar of Springfield, I have been instructed to present\n               these resolutions, passed by them as a tribute of respect to the memory of the lateCharles R. Welles, esq., and to accompany their presentation with the request that your honor would order\n               them to be spread upon the records, and that the court should, as a further expression\n               of honor to the deceased, adjourn until to-morrow morning. In complying with these instructions, while it is not my intention to pronounce a\n               eulogy on the character of our departed friend, I should do violence to my own feelings\n               if I did not, at this time, add my testimony to the worth, theexcellentworth of Mr. Wells.  Although, from the nature of the business transacted mostly\n               by him, he has not, for the last few years, often been actively engaged in the contests\n               of the court room, yet the strict fidelity, the unswerving integrity with which he\n               has ever discharged the duties of the lawyer, as well as of the private individual,\n               in the management of a large and profitable business, have always reflected credit\n               alike on the man and the profession of which he was a member. It required an intimate acquaintance with him rightly to appreciate his many excellencies\n               of character; although apparently cold and reserved, no man possesaed a kinder heart, or one more ready ever to sympathise with the joys or sorrows of his fellow men, or a disposition better qualified to\n               enjoy, and contribute to the  enjoyment by others, of the socialities of life.  In\n               fact, it was in the social and family circle that his virtues were eminently developed,\n               and for this very reason, while those of us among whom his intercourse was more public,\n               regret his loss to us and to society, his family feel with more intense grief his\n               absence from them. In conclusion, I have known Mr. Wells for many years— in fact, ever since his settlement\n               in this city.  For the last few years my intercourse with him has been more intimate.\n               For him my esteem, my friendship has been constantly increasing.  The resolutions\n               speak of his distinguishing characteristics of integrity and purity of heart.  No\n               one could associate with him without being impressed with the prominence of these\n               virtues.  Of him we can all say, he was “PURE IN HEART,” and console ourselves that\n               he is now rejoicing in the fruition of the blessing pronounced upon those possessed\n               of this exalted virtue.  I now move that the proceedings of the meeting of the members\n               of the bar, and the resolutions passed by them, be spread upon the records of this\n               court, and that this court do now adjourn. JudgeDavisreplied as follows: The court bears equal testimony with the bar to the merits of Mr. Welles, while living,\n               and cherishes equal sorrow for his death.  His life was illustrated by great purity\n               of purpose, integrity of character, and a conscientious discharge of the various duties\n               and obligations resting upon him. The court is fully sensible that every tribute of respect is due to the memory of\n               Mr. Welles, and therefore directs that the proceedings of the bar, together with the\n               remarks of Mr. Edwards, be spread on the records, and that the court now adjourn.4",
