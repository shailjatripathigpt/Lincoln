        "text": "2Abraham Lincolnarrived inMacombat noon on October 25 and proceeded to the Randolph House, a hotel owned byWilliam H. Randolph, accompanied by a cheering crowd. By the time of his speech at two, a crowd of more\n                  than four thousand people had gathered to hear him.Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  In local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection.

        "text": "3In the first of a series ofseven debatesbetween Lincoln and Douglas inOttawa, Illinois, on August 21, 1858, Lincoln argued that the founders of the nation set slavery on\n                  a road to ultimate extinction, and that the Republicans were following in that path.\n                  He said, “I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it (slavery) whereWashington, andJefferson, andMadisonplaced it, itwould bein the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mindwould, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.\n                  The crisis would be past and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years,\n                  if it should live so long, in the States where it exists, yet it would be going out\n                  of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races.”In the seventh debate, held on October 15 inAlton, Illinois, Lincoln joked about Douglas’ record of inconsistencies. He said, “I want to know\n                  ifBuchananhas not as much right to be inconsistent as Douglas has? Has Douglas theexclusive right, in this country, of being onall sides of all questions? Is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself? Is he to have an entiremonopolyon that subject?”In the Lincoln-Douglas Debates and in solo speeches, Lincoln and Douglas battled over\n                  which party, the Democratic or the Republican, best represented and defended Henry\n                  Clay’s legacy. For published reports of additional 1858 campaign speeches in which\n                  Lincoln’s explanations of how the political principles of Henry Clay were similar\n                  to the platform of the Republican Party were reported more fully, see Report of Speech at Lewistown, Illinois,Summary of Speech at Augusta, Illinois, Report of Speech at Bloomington, Illinois, and Report of Speech at Edwardsville, Illinois.First Debate with Stephen A.
