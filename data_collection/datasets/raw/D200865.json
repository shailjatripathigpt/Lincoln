        "text": "2French immigrants settled inIllinoisearly in its history. During theWar of 1812, American forces burned Peoria and displaced its French settlers. In 1820 and again\n                  in 1823,Congressoffered the French settlers claims to their former property. The land at the time\n                  had very little value, and many immigrants had moved away and did not accept the offer.\n                  However, land prices eventually increased, and by the 1830s and 1840s, surveyors made\n                  plats based on the French claims, resulting in disputes between original settlers\n                  and the current owners. One such case wasPapin v. Hall, for which Lincoln served as a co-attorney withOrville H. Browningon behalf ofWilliam A. Hallagainst Joseph L. Papin, an original claimant.  In July 1858,  theU.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinoisdecided for Papin. Hall appealed the judgment to theU.S. Supreme Court. In December 1860, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the circuit court.Joseph C. Brown, a deputy from the Surveyor General’s office at St. Louis, created\n                  a survey that included these French claims.Newspaper Report, Document ID: 132934; Newspaper Report, Document ID: 132935,Papin v.
