Lovejoy\n                  also wrote toIllinoispoliticianLyman Trumbull, ananti-NebraskaDemocrat, on August 7, 1855. That letter is likewise unlocated, but Trumbull’s response of\n                  August 20, 1855, and Lincoln’s response here suggest that Lovejoy wrote to both men\n                  soliciting their support for a statewide convention of a fusion of disparate political\n                  parties united by their opposition to the repeal of theMissouri Compromiseand to the extension of slavery. Lincoln and Trumbull both expressed reservations\n                  about such a convention and none was held in the autumn of 1855.Lyman Trumbull to Owen Lovejoy, 20 August 1855, in Lyman Trumbull Family Papers, Abraham\n                     Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum (Springfield, IL); Victor B.

One day prior to the composition of this letter, theIllinois State Journalhad reported that in early returns in all three states theAmerican Partyhad seen successes.   The  newspaper reported that in Kentucky, the American Party\n                  candidate for governor,Charles S. Morehead, was gaining in the polls, and accurately projected that six American Party members\n                  had been elected to theU.S. House of Representativesfrom the state. Morehead ultimately won with 51.6 percent of the vote. In Tennessee,\n                  it was projected that five or six members of the American Party had likely won election\n                  to the U.S. House of Representatives; five indeed won seats. Partial returns suggested\n                  incorrectly that George D.

In one such speech given  inPeoriaon October 16, 1854, Lincoln criticizedWhigswho were reluctant to call for the restoration of the Missouri Compromise for fear\n                  of being identified with abolitionists, saying “Stand with anybody that standsright. Stand with him while he is right andpartwith him when he goes wrong.

The preamble\n                  outlined what the freemen ofAdams Countyand Quincy acknowledged to be the rights of slave states, but went on to argue that\n                  no territory had a constitutional right to demand admittance as a state, and that\n                  theU.S. Congresshad a sacred duty to consider such applications for statehood and to judge how the\n                  admission of territories might affect the prosperity, rights, and safety of the Union.\n                  Following the preamble, the committee proposed four resolutions: that the conditions\n                  demanded as necessary to protect slavery in areas where slavery was expanding were\n                  inconsistent with freedom and must be resisted, that they would “strive by all legal\n                  means to restore toKansasandNebraskathe legal guaranty against Slavery,” that they viewed settling the relationship of\n                  the general and state governments to slavery and the restriction of slavery to its\n                  current authorized limits as the paramount issues before them, and that they deemed\n                  it the duty of all who agreed on these views to unite to implement them “without regard\n                  to differences of opinion upon any other issues.” The preamble and resolutions were\n                  adopted by the meeting without dissent.Quincy Whig(IL), 4 August 1855, 2:3."

While\n                  he began by giving speeches during the 1854  congressional election campaign as described\n                  above, he ultimately allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate. Ultimately, he did not\n                  win election to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected Trumbull instead,\n                  and Lincoln thereafter refocused his attention on his neglected legal career.

He was  apparently selected because the defense team deemed\n                  it prudent to have at least one Illinois-based attorney as the trial was scheduled\n                  to be held inChicago.
