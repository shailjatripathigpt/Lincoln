However, in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln did not win election\n                  to the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected Trumbull instead. Gillespie\n                  cast his vote for Edwards on the first ballot, but Edwards dropped out after the first\n                  vote, and Gillespie shifted his allegiance to Lincoln.  Gillespie supported Lincoln\n                  until the ninth ballot, when he transferred his vote to Trumbull.  Allen and Baker\n                  cast their votes for Trumbull on all the ballots.  Trapp and Kinney both voted forGustave P. Koerneruntil the seventh ballot, when Trapp switched toJoel A. Matteson.  Kinney switched from Koerner to Matteson on the ninth ballot.
