After Todd’s death, Abraham and Mary Lincoln reactivated this case in theKentucky Fayette County Circuit Court, with them as plaintiffs, because property was at stake which they believed they\n                  were legally entitled to as Todd’s heirs.Edwards was also involved in the caseOldham & Hemingway v. Lincoln et al.In this case, which also arose after Todd’s death,Edward OldhamandThomas Hemingway, the surviving partners ofOldham, Todd and Company, which had included Todd, claimed that the company had hired Lincoln and Edwards\n                  to collect some debts for them inIllinois.  Oldham and Hemingway claimed that Lincoln, Edwards, and Kinkead (who was acting\n                  as Lincoln's attorney in Lexington) failed to pay them $472.54. In June 1853, Oldham\n                  and Hemingway sued Lincoln and others in a chancery action in the Kentucky Fayette\n                  County Circuit Court to recover the debt.For full details on theTodd et al. v.
