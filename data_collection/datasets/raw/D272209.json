        "text": "1This summary appeared in the September 3, 1858, edition of theBloomington Pantagraph.Abraham Lincolnarrived inClinton, Illinois, on the train fromDecaturon the morning of September 2. A crowd of supporters in Clinton forced Lincoln to\n                  go on toWapellaso that they could escort him back to Clinton with a procession. When the procession\n                  arrived at a mound a short distance from the court house,  Lincoln was greeted with\n                  cheers and a brass band.Lawrence Weldonthen gave aspeechwelcoming him, to which these remarks are a response. Later that day Lincoln gave\n                  a formal speech in Clinton.Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.
