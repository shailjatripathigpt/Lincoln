        "text": "2Despite his involvement in the May, 1856Illinois Anti-Nebraska Conventionthat effectively founded theRepublican Partyin the state, former Whig Joseph Gillespie was an active supporter of theAmerican Partyduring the1856 election. Gillespie was distrustful of the conservative formeranti-NebraskaDemocrats who had attended the convention, and suspected that they would abandon\n                  the embryonicIllinoisRepublican coalition  and support DemocratJames Buchananfor president rather than Republican candidateJohn C. Fremont. During the campaign Gillespie stumped for the American Party, acted as a statewide\n                  elector at large for American Party presidential candidateMillard Fillmore, and was rumored at one point to be under consideration to be the American Party\n                  candidate for Illinois governor. He instead ran successfully for reelection to theIllinois Senate, with newspaper reports of his election divided over whether he was a member of the\n                  American Party or the Republican Party. The Republican Party apparently made fruitless\n                  attempts to win him over during the campaign.Joseph Gillespie to Abraham Lincoln;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 9 April 1856, 2:1; 14 July 1856, 2:1;The Ottawa Free Trader(IL), 24 May 1856, 2:2; 20 September 1856, 1:4; 22 November 1856, 1:6;Galena Daily Courier(IL), 8 July 1856, 2:3; 11 September 1856, 3:2;Rock Island Morning Argus(IL), 19 November 1856, 2:1;Freeport Daily Journal(IL), 28 November 1856, 2:2."

        "text": "3Turner is referring to Abraham Lincoln himself, who gave a lengthy speech at a rally in support of Fremont in Jacksonville on Saturday, September 6, 1856,\n                  in which he urged anti-slavery Democrats not to vote for Buchanan. From July 1856\n                  onwards, Lincoln gave over fifty speeches across Illinois in support of Fremont’s\n                  presidential campaign and to rally the disparate elements of the emerging Republican\n                  Party. See the1856 Federal Election.Despite Turner’s opinion of the effectiveness of Lincoln’s speech in Jacksonville,\n                  Buchanan ultimately earned the most votes inMorgan County, garnering 47.3 percent of the vote, compared to Fremont’s 27.5 percent and Fillmore’s\n                  25.3 percent.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 6 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-06; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:425-33; Howard W.

        "text": "4The district in question was the Sixth Congressional District of Illinois, which included\n                  both Morgan andSangamoncounties. The nascent Illinois Republican Party considered several candidates to\n                  run for theU.S. House of Representativesagainst incumbent DemocratThomas L. Harrisin the district in 1856.Richard Yates, who had lost his reelection bid for the seat to Harris in the1854 election, refused to run again. Lincoln and other Republican leaders met in July1856 with\n                  the hope of persuading anti-Nebraska DemocratJohn M. Palmerto be their party’s candidate for the seat, but he declined.By early September, Springfield merchantJohn Williamshad been chosen to run instead, and was touted as a hardworking “honestClayWhig” who threatened to win the votes of Fillmore supporters and of anti-slavery\n                  Democrats. Harris defeated him handily,  garnering 54 percent of the vote to Williams’\n                  46 percent. At the end of Williams’ life, it was claimed that he outperformed a Democratic\n                  majority of 4,000 voters in losing by only about 2,100 votes. Yates, however, had\n                  lost the seat by only 200 votes in the previous election.Julian M. Sturtevantalso wrote Lincoln later this same month urging him to run for the U.S. House of Representatives\n                  in the Sixth District, as he thought Williams was likely to be defeated. Lincoln replied that he declined to run because he believed his candidacy would hurt the Republican\n                  cause.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:424; Abraham Lincoln and Others to John M.
