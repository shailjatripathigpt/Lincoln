He had pledged to serve only one term, but many Whigs in the district\n                  favored his renomination. Lincoln was not averse to running again, butStephen T. Loganreceived the nomination. In August 1848, Logan would lose toThomas L. Harrisin a close race. \n                  In the August election, Edward D. Baker had won election in the Sixth Congressional\n                  District.Lincoln also recommendedWilliam S. WallaceandOrville Paddockfor the position.  Hurst resigned as agent in June 1849, and Wallace replaced him\n                  on June 30.
