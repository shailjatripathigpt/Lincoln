        "text": "1TheIllinois State Journalpublished this letter, reprinted from theChattanooga Times, in its October 30, 1883 edition.  The original in Abraham Lincoln’s hand has not\n                  been located.   John G. Nicolay and John Hay also published aversionof this letter in theComplete Works of Abraham Lincoln.  Significant differences from this version and the John G. Nicolay and John Hay\n                  version have been noted; differences such as capitalization and minor grammar alterations\n                  have not been noted.The document does not contain a recipient name. Nicolay and Hay  listJesse Lincoln, and Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, does the same. Interestingly, the text immediately preceding this letter in theIllinois State Journalsuggests the recipient could be named Israel:  “Dr. Lincoln, of this city, a cousin\n                  of Abraham Lincoln, has in his possession a letter written to his father by his relative\n                  in 1854, which sheds some light on the illustrious statesmen’s family history. Dr.\n                  Lincoln’s father was at the time living in an upper East Tennessee county. The fame\n                  of Abraham Lincoln was becoming national at that period. Mr. Lincoln’s name was Israel,\n                  and all his relatives bore Biblical names. When the name Abraham Lincoln reached his\n                  ears he wrote him making inquiries regarding his family, feeling confident that he\n                  was a relative, and the following was the response.” The Dr. Lincoln in question was\n                  Dr. James H. Lincoln, son of Jesse and Nancy Brown Lincoln.  Jesse Lincoln was the\n                  grand-uncle of Abraham Lincoln.  Nicolay, Hay, and Basler inferred Jessie Lincoln\n                  as the recipient from newspaper article, which incorrectly identified James H. Lincoln’s\n                  father as Israel.John G. Nicolay and John Hay, eds.,Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln, new and enlarged ed. (New York: Francis D. Tandy, 1905), 2:180-82; Roy P.
