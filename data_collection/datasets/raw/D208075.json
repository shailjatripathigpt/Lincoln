On the map,\n                  all the text is in Lincoln’s handwriting, except the “valued at ___” additions, which\n                  are written vertically. The decimal numbers written in the spaces between each lot\n                  vertically and horizontally represent the dimensions of each lot boundary in feet.\n                  The whole numbers 1 through 34 correspond to the landmarks laid out in the succeeding\n                  table. The table transcribed here was written entirely by Lincoln. Lincoln also wrote\n                  and signed Neale’s certification."
