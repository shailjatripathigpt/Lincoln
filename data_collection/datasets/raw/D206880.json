        "text": "2Lincoln references legal work for theAlton & Sangamon Railroad Company, which had retainedLincoln & Herndonto collect balances due on shares of capital stock purchased by stockholders. TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in February 1847 to construct and operate a railroad between\n                  Alton, Illinois, viaNew Berlin, and Springfield, Illinois.  Section two  of the company’s charter allowed the incorporators\n                  to issue $500,000 in stock at $100 per share, and section six required subscribers\n                  to purchase stock by paying $5 on each share subscribed at the time of subscribing\n                  and the balance in installments called for by a board of directors. The incorporators\n                  opened subscription for stock in May 1847, and James A. Barret purchased thirty shares\n                  ($3,000).    He also owned 4,215 acres of land in southwesternSangamon County, Illinois,  which bordered the proposed route. On January 29, 1851, however, the General Assembly\n                  altered the charter to allow the company to construct the road on a more direct route,\n                  bypassing the property of several stockholders, including Barret.  Believing that\n                  the change in route voided their subscription agreements, Barret and other investors\n                  refused to pay their remaining installments, and the company  hired Lincoln & Herndon\n                  to collect the full subscriptions.  Barret and several other delinquent subscribers\n                  were from Sangamon County, and thirty-seven were fromMadison County, Illinois.  William Martin was among the incorporators.Lincoln planned to bring suit on behalf of the railroad against Sangamon County residents\n                  Barret,Joseph Klein, Sr.,John M.

        "text": "3On February 19, LincolnwroteMartin requesting the name of either the clerk or secretary.  Martin responded on\n                  the same day.  Martin’s letter has not been located, and its contents remain unknown,\n                  but he probably provided Lincoln with the name of the secretary,Isaac Gibson, who Lincoln sought to depose in the Barret and Klein lawsuits.Barret refused to settle, and in March 1851, the company sued Barret in theSangamon County Circuit Courtin an action of assumpsit to collect the balance due on the thirty shares of capital\n                  stock.  In November, the court ruled for the railroad, and awarded it $1,351.  Barret\n                  appealed to theIllinois Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment in December, establishing an important precedent for\n                  subsequent stock subscription cases.  JusticeSamuel H. Treat, who wrote the opinion for the court, relied on Lincoln’s legal citations and argument,\n                  reasoning that unforeseen construction problems concerning a public improvement could\n                  not be fully known when the General Assembly granted a charter.  Therefore, the General\n                  Assembly might remedy the situation by amending the charter without the consent of\n                  all the incorporators.  Treat concluded that a \"few obstinate stockholders should\n                  not be permitted to deprive the public and the company of the advantages that will\n                  result from a superior and less expensive route.\" The development of Lincoln's argument\n                  is clear from letters that Lincoln wrote Martin between  March and August 1851.Abraham Lincoln to William Martin; Abraham Lincoln to William Martin; Abraham Lincoln to William Martin; Abraham Lincoln to William Martin; Abraham Lincoln to William Martin; Abraham Lincoln to William Martin;  Abraham Lincoln to William Martin; Abraham Lincoln to William Martin;Abraham Lincoln to William Martin;Abraham Lincoln to William Martin.
