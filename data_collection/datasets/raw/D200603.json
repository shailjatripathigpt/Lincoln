Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere among the early contestants. Abraham Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.Porter notes Lincoln’s preparations for a journey because Lincoln, at the urging \n                  ofWilliam H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, had decided  to travel to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;William H. Henderson to Abraham Lincoln;Josiah M.
