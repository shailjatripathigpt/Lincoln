        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln lithographed copies of this letter, filled in the date and salutation,\n                  and added “(Confidential)” to the bottom of the page. The letter, a strategy for winning\n                  Illinois in thepresidential election of 1856, was sent to several supporters of Millard Fillmore.Republicansnominated John C. Fremont as their first presidential candidate in 1856, whileDemocratsnominated James Buchanan. The end of theWhig Partyand the rise of theAmerican—or “Know-Nothing”—Party added a third-party element to the election.  The American\n                  Party, in its final participation in a presidential election, nominated Fillmore.\n                  Lincoln and the Republicans believed they could create an alliance with the American\n                  Party against the Democrats over the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories,\n                  which the Democrats supported.One recipient, John Kirkpatrick, published Lincoln’s letter and his reply, which then\n                  reappeared in the opposition press. TheDewitt Courierwrote of Lincoln, “It will be seen by reading the circular that one of the leaders\n                  of theBlack Republican partyof this State considers the election of Fremont as doubtful.”Lincoln and his fellow Republicans failed to convince Fillmore’s supporters to unite,\n                  allowing Democrats to label their opponents as both nativists and worshippers of African\n                  Americans. Buchanan captured Illinois with 44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent\n                  for Fremont and 15.7 for Fillmore, and Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore to become\n                  fifteenth president of the United States. Indeed, if the votes received by Fremont\n                  and Fillmore in Illinois had been combined, Buchanan’s vote would not have been sufficient\n                  to carry the state.Thomas F. Schwartz, “Lincoln, Form Letters, and Fillmore Men,”Illinois Historical Journal78 (Spring 1985), 68; Roy P. Basler, ed.,The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 2:374;The Dewitt Courier(Clinton, IL), 15 October 1856, 2:3; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:432-33; Philip G.

        "text": "3In the end, Buchanan took just over 45 percent of the national popular vote, and Fremont\n                  took around 33 percent. Fremont sweptNew Englandand wonNew York, in addition to the mid-western states ofOhio,Michigan,Wisconsin, andIowa. However, Fremont ballots were only available in four slave states,Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, andVirginia; he  did not register a single popular vote inAlabama,Arkansas,Florida,Georgia,Louisiana,Mississippi,Missouri,North Carolina,Tennessee, orTexas. Buchanan swept the south but also won Delaware,New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana,California, and, as predicted by Lincoln, Illinois. Fillmore and his anti-immigrant, anti-Catholiccampaign won just over 21 percent of the national popular vote and won onlyMaryland.Lewis Clephane,Birth of the Republican Party, with a Brief History of the Important Part Taken by\n                        the Original Republican Association of the National Capital(Washington: Gibson Bros., 1889), 15;Cong.
