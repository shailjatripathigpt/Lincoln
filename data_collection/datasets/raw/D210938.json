He says he has a good joke on you in relation to the bill againstTalcott Emerson & Co. He thinks you had more politics than law in your head at the time you drew it up.2Still he says he will take no advantage of it. Well, I understand him to say that\n               he intends defending on the ground that, my Patent is good only for the precise manner\n               that I use it, i.e. in a shoving machine, but will not reach him, or theMannymachine; and said if it would<Page 2>reach the Manny machine, it was so broad as to ruin it. He says, he will put in his\n               answer in October, then we can see his position all clear.3 Now in relation to my^Pt[Patent]^being so broad as to viciate it provided it covers the Manny mn[Machine] I confess I cannot understand it, unless he means that, if my Patent is constrewed to reach to Mannys, then it is cut out by theMoore & HaskallandtheJonathan Read's machines. Now of these two I think theM & H, to be the most difficult to explain away: had I best make a Model corresponding\n               with the M & H drawings so as to make the matter plain? for I am satisfyed that they will make the strong fight on that point. Perhaps you do not remember the precise arrangement of the M & H machine as well as\n               I do, but my opinion is that the ponderous weight forward of that machine will be\n               the only defence for us, for certain it is that he used a lever the same as I<Page 3>do, but certain it is that the manner in which he attached his horses, and the great\n               weight forward the driver could not have governed it, and another thing, there was\n               no \"SeatorStand\" for the driver on the machine at al– Also we will try to make it appear that there was no \"driversSeatorStand\" on the Read machine, although in the drawings of the reissue, the driver is placed\n               just beside the raker. Tho, fortunately the so called driver Stand is upon the body of the mach[ine]and the lever is attached to the same thing—  also Read's machine had a tremendous\n               weight forward, and I am now under the impression that our Strongest points lays in this feature of those old machines. My Patent is, attaching a lever in a certain\n               manner to a frame, or tongue of a harvesting machine, \"nearly balanced on its supporting\n               wheels,\" Manny's machine is nearly balanced– Now I think I can prove by good witnesses that Manny's machine is nearly balanced—\n               and also that<Page 4>theMoore & Haskaland Reads machines were not \"nearly balanced on their supporting wheels– Having nothing to do this evening I thot I would drop you this line– Watson will be atChicagothe latter part of this month, attending to the suit byHussyagainstMcCormick.

        "text": "2Haines is most likely referencing Lincoln’s bill of complaint in the caseHaines & Haines v. Talcott et al.In American law, a bill of complaint or bill for relief is a statement put forth\n                  by the plaintiff which includes the major facts of the case—including the specific\n                  complaint or wrong the complainant suffered—and a request for the court to compel\n                  the defendant in the case to respond to the charges of the bill.InHaines & Haines v. Talcott et al., brothers Jonathan Haines andAnsel HainessuedWait Talcott, along with the other surviving representatives ofManny and Company, for infringement upon a patent for a reaper (a kind of harvesting machine). The\n                  Haines brothers retained Lincoln, who launched the case in July 1858, and Peter H.\n                  Watson served as the attorney for Talcott. At the time, Lincoln was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace incumbentDemocratStephen A. Douglasin theU.S. Senatein the1858 Federal Election.“Bill of Complaint,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

        "text": "4Haines referencesHussey v. McCormick, a reaper patent lawsuit with which Lincoln was not involved. In the case, Obed Hussey\n                  sued Cyrus H. McCormick in May 1857 in theU.S. Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinoisfor infringing upon his reaper patents. He sought damages for past infringements\n                  and an injunction against further sales. Watson served as Hussey’s attorney in this\n                  case. In September 1859, Circuit JusticeJohn McLeanupheld Hussey’s claims, issued an injunction restricting McCormick from using the\n                  patented elements at stake, and assessed $80,618.73 in damages.Lincoln did not travel to Chicago in the latter part of September to attend the U.S.\n                  Circuit Court, Northern District of Illinois’ hearings onHussey v. McCormick, as he was campaigning throughout thestateon behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. Hussey later gave deposition in another reaper patent case with which Lincoln was\n                  involved. For details on that case, seeMcCormick v. Talcott et al., Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition,https://www.lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Details.aspx?case=137741.Ultimately, in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes\n                  cast in Illinois, yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General\n                  Assembly. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Lincoln and the Haines brothers corresponded at least twice more regarding the caseHaines & Haines v. Talcott et al.after this letter. Lincoln also corresponded with other individuals regarding this\n                  case at least five times. In 1859, Lincoln wrote to Watson as the attorney for Talcott\n                  in the case, requesting that they try the case in separate pieces. Watson refused.\n                  The trial was delayed because both sides needed to take depositions. No additional\n                  correspondence related to the case has been located beyond October 1859. Lincoln most\n                  likely represented the Haines’ interests in this case until he was elected president\n                  in the1860 Federal Election, but the final outcome of the case is unknown.William T.
