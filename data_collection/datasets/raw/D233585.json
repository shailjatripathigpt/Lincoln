It is not entirely clear when Tyler\n                  removed Kinzie, but it would be characteristic of Tyler’s behavior in the latter part\n                  of his administration, as he abandon his previous support for civil service reform\n                  and replaced Whigs withDemocratsand other would be supporters  to build support for apresidential run in 1844.Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1841(Washington, DC: Thomas Allen, 1841), 89;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, from the Thirtieth September, 1841 to the Thirtieth September,\n                        1843(Washington, DC: J. & G.
