        "text": "2Lincoln and Joseph Gillespie corresponded about the upcoming state elections inIllinois. Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate for theU.S. SenateagainstDemocraticincumbentSteven A. Douglas. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Early in the campaign, Lincoln followed Douglas on the stump, delivering speeches\n                  either later in the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. Both Republicans\n                  and Democrats criticized this strategy, and it was of particular irritation to Douglas.\n                  Lincoln had invited Douglas to aseries of debateson July 24. Douglas’sresponse, published inThe Illinois State Journalon July 29, offered several excuses to avoid the request, including his already scheduled\n                  speeches. Douglas wrote, “These appointments have all been made for Democratic meetings\n                  and arrangements have been made by which the Democratic Candidates forCongress, for theLegislatureand other offices will be present and address the people. It is evident, therefore,\n                  that these various candidates, in connection with myself, will occupy the whole time\n                  of the day and evening and leave no opportunity for other speeches.” In hisresponseaccepting Douglas's terms for the debates, Lincoln promised to no longer be at any\n                  more of Douglas's \"exclusive meetings.\"  In addition to Alexander, Lincoln wrote Republicans\n                  in other localities announcing that he would not present at the times of Douglas's\n                  visits.  Douglas’s published schedule included a visit to Edwardsville, Illinois on\n                  Friday, August 6.Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A. Douglas;Abraham Lincoln to Stephen A. Douglas;Stephen A.

        "text": "4In 1858, the Buchanan administration was desperately seeking support from Democratic\n                  newspapers in Illinois; however, most editors leaned toward Douglas. Buchanan thus\n                  employed federal patronage to threaten newspaper editors who were postmasters and\n                  to bribe editors who were not. Postmasters had considerable political power, controlling\n                  the disbursement of official and political documents, intercepting personal and political\n                  correspondence, and ensuring—or forbidding—newspaper circulation.Don E.
