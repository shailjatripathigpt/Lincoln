Presumably, he made the same request of Morrison. Originally,Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to replaceRichard M. Youngas commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield\n                  was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. No letter of reference from Morrison to Lincoln has been located. MorrisonwroteLincoln again June 14, 1849.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B. Herrick;Abraham Lincoln to James M.
