        "text": "2The enclosed letter that Thomas references was not found with this letter, and has\n                  not been located. In early June 1849, Abraham Lincoln sent a series of letters to\n                  numerous people requesting letters in support of his candidacy for commissioner of\n                  theU.S. General Land Office. Presumably, Lincoln made a similar request of Thomas, although no such letter has\n                  been located.Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office. Lincoln entered\n                  the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards.Thomas Ewingwas the secretary of theU.S. Department of the Interior, but President Zachary Taylor was ultimately responsible for appointing the commissioner\n                  of the U.S. General Land Office.

        "text": "3On January 27, 1849, Thomas wrote Lincoln aletterinforming him that he had asked Joseph R. Underwood to recommend Edwards for commissioner\n                  of the U.S. General Land Office. On June 3, 1849, Lincoln wrote Underwood aletterasking if he could write President Taylor in an effort “to save” Edwards’ chances\n                  of defeating Butterfield and recommend Lincoln for the job over Butterfield in the\n                  event that Edwards was not successful. In a June 6, 1849letter,William W. BishopandAlexander P. Dunbarwrote Lincoln to warn him that people were “prejudicing” Underwood in favor of Butterfield.\n                  As competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah M. Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position.  On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19. Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment;\n                  the job went to Butterfield instead.
