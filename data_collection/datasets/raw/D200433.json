On December 22, 1847, Lincoln “distinguished” himself from his peers by wading\n                  into the dispute over PresidentJames K. Polk’s justification for theMexican War.  He presented a series ofresolutionscalling on the president to provideCongresswith the exact spot on which American blood was shed in clashes with Mexican forces\n                  that led to the declaration of war.  Lincoln followed up these “Spot Resolutions”\n                  with aspeechon January 12, 1848, attacking Polk’s justification for the war.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:264-65."
