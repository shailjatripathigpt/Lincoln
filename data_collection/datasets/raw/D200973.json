        "text": "4This loan constituted a mortgage for four lots of land that Jacob had acquired from\n                  the estate of his brother,Daniel E. Ruckel. Jacob and Laura Ruckel agreed to repay this mortgage, plus ten percent annual interest,\n                  within one year. As notations and endorsements on this document reveal, this mortgage\n                  was extended but eventually paid in full. As shown in the fourth image, Jacob made\n                  the first year’s interest payment on November 27, 1858, paid the second year’s interest\n                  at some point (Lincoln did not note the date), and paid the third year’s interest\n                  on November 17, 1860. Lincoln then left the note withRobert Irwin, cashier of theSpringfield Marine and Fire Insurance Company, who collected the loan’s principle and remaining interest totaling $667.05 on January\n                  29, 1864, as shown in the third image. Irwin released the mortgage the same day.In August 1851, Lincoln had also loaned Daniel Ruckel funds for several lots of land\n                  in Springfield that Daniel wished to purchase, but Daniel died before he could repay\n                  that mortgage debt in full. Jacob andRichard H. Beachadministered Daniel’s estate.Harry E.

If her deceased\n                  husband had no children, the widow received outright ownership of one-half of the\n                  estate.This land would have become part of the right of dower to which Laura was entitled,\n                  should she be widowed, but she relinquished her claim of right of dower with this\n                  section of the deed.“Dower,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
