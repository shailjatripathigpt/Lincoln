He thought it\n               but fair, however, when this joint resolution had been so fully, and, he might say,\n               so ably discussed by gentlemen on the other side of the House, that those who were\n               opposed to it—in other words, that those who advocated a substitute for the resolution\n               reported, should be heard also in advocacy of their views in  opposition to the report.
