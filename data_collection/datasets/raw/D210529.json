        "text": "2This is a reference to Abraham Lincoln seeking appointment as commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Henry wrote Lincoln two other letters about the Land Office position several days\n                  before this letter.Henry wrote to Lincoln at Washington, DC because, as competition for the job intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position. On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19. Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment;\n                  the job went to Butterfield instead.
