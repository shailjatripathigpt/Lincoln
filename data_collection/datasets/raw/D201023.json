Seward and other eastern Republicans  of conspiring to supportDemocratStephen A. Douglas’ reelection to theU.S. Senaterather than supporting Lincoln for the office.Douglas had criticized theLecompton Constitutionand PresidentJames Buchanan’s support of it in December 1857, causing a rift in the Democratic Party. Douglas’\n                  repudiation of the Lecompton Constitution led some Republicans to consider embracing\n                  him. Although Douglas later denied it, he courted Republican support—meeting in person\n                  with prominent men such as Horace Greeley and hinting in correspondence to Republicans\n                  that he was finished with the Democratic Party. Lincoln and other Republicans were\n                  concerned by these developments and urged fellow party members to remain loyal in\n                  the upcomingsenatorial election. In Lincoln’s view, Douglas disagreed with the Buchanan administration over whether\n                  the Lecompton Constitution accurately represented the will of Kansans, but did not\n                  repudiate the overall goal of admittingKansasas a slave state.Chicago Democrateditor John Wentworth had visitedNew Yorkin the spring of 1858 and on his return toChicagoreportedto Lincoln in April that he feared that Seward,Thurlow Weed, and their allies were supporting Douglas.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-50; Franklin William\n                     Scott,Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, vol. 6 ofCollections of the Illinois State Historical Library(Springfield: Illinois State Historical Library, 1910), 52."

        "text": "6In the letter to which this is a response, Wilson stated that the public impression was that Wentworth\n                  was denouncing Seward in theChicago Democratin support of Lincoln’s candidacy for U.S. Senate in exchange for Lincoln backing\n                  him for governor of Illinois.Wentworth had earlier in the spring of 1858 apparently harbored hopes of receiving\n                  the nomination for U.S. Senate himself, calculating that  continued division in the\n                  Democratic Party could result in Buchanan Democrats forming an anti-Douglas coalition\n                  with Republicans which might support him. The weakness of the Buchanan Democrats at\n                  their April 21, 1858 convention made this possibility seem unlikely, and he soon endorsed\n                  Lincoln in theChicago Democrat.Don E.
