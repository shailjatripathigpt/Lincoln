    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln, Stephen T. Logan, and Albert T. Bledsoe to the People of the State\n               of Illinois, 4 March 18431 ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OFILLINOIS. By a resolution of ameetingof such of theWhigsof theState, as are now atSpringfield, we, the undersigned, were appointed to prepare an address to you.  The performance\n               of the task we now undertake. Several resolutions were adopted by the meeting; and the chief object of this address\n               is, to show briefly, the reasons for their adoption. The first of those resolutions declares a tariff of duties upon foreign importations,\n               producing sufficient revenue for the support of the General Government, and so adjusted\n               as to protect American industry, to be indispensably necessary to the prosperity of\n               the Amercan People; and the second declares Direct Taxation for a National Revenue to be improper.\n               Those two resolutions are kindred in their nature, and therefore proper and convenient\n               to be considered together.  The question of protection is entirely too broad to be\n               crowded into a few pages only, together with several other subjects.  On that point,\n               we therefore content ourselves with giving the following extracts from the writings\n               of Mr.Jefferson,Gen. Jackson, and the speech of Mr.Calhoun: “To be independent for the comforts of life, we must fabricate them ourselves.—We\n               must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist.  The grand inquiry\n               now is, shall we make our own comforts, or go without them at the will of a foreign\n               nation? He, therefore, who is now against domestic manufactures must be for reducing\n               us either to dependence on that foreign nation, or to be clothed in skins and to live\n               like wild beasts, in dens and caverns.  I am not one of those; experience has taught\n               me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort.”\n               –Letter of Mr. Jefferson toBenjamin Austin.2 “I ask, what is the real situation of the agriculturalist? Where has the American\n               farmer a market for his surplus produce? Except for cotton, he has neither a foreign\n               nor a home market.  Does not this clearly prove, when there is no market at home or\n               abroad, that there is too much labor employed in agriculture?  Common sense at once\n               points out the remedy.  Take from agriculture 600,000 men, women and children, and\n               you will at once give a market for more breadstuffs than allEuropenow furnishes.  In short, we have been too long subject to the policy of British\n               merchants.  It is time we should become a little moreAmericanized, and, instead of feeding the paupers and laborers ofEngland, feed our own; or else, in a short time, by continuing our present policy, we shall\n               all be rendered paupers ourselves.—Gen. Jackson’s letter to Dr.Coleman.3 “When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon will be, under\n               the fostering care of Government, the farmer will find a ready market for his surplus\n               produce, and, what is of equal consequence, a certain and cheap supply of all he wants;\n               his prosperity will diffuse itself to every class of the community.”—Speech of Hon. J. C. Calhoun on the tariff.4 The question of Revenue we will now briefly consider.  For several years past, the\n               revenues of the Government have been unequal to its expenditures, and consequently,\n               loan after loan, sometimes directly, and sometimes indirectly in form, have been resorted\n               to.  By this means a new National debt, has been created, and is still growing on\n               us with a rapidity fearful to contemplate—a rapidity only reasonably to be expected\n               in time of war.  This state of things has been produced by a prevailing unwillingness,\n               either to increase the tariff, or resort to direct taxation.  But the one or the other\n               must come.  Coming expenditures must be met, and the present debt must be paid; and\n               money cannot always be borrowed for these objects.  The system of loans is but temporary\n               in its nature, and must soon explode.  It is a system,  not only ruinous while it\n               lasts, but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute.  As an individual who undertakes\n               to live by borrowing, soon finds his original means devoured by interest, and next\n               no one left to borrow from—so must it be with a government. We repeat, then, that a tariff sufficient for revenue, or a direct tax, must soon\n               be resorted to; and, indeed, we believe this alternative is now denied by no one.\n               But which system shall be adopted?  Some of our opponents, in theory, admit the propriety\n               of a tariff sufficient for revenue; but even they, will not inpracticevote for such a tariff; while others boldly advocate direct taxation.  Inasmuch,\n               therefore, as some of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the rest, or so\n               nearly all, as to make exceptions needless, refuse to adopt the tariff—we think it\n               is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation. Indeed,\n               we believe, they are only delaying an open avowal of the system, till they can assure\n               themselves that the people will.  Let us then briefly compare the two systems.  The\n               tariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in large parcels\n               at a few commercial points, will require comparatively few officers in their collection;\n               while, by the direct tax system, the land must be literally covered with assessors\n               and collectors, going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade\n               of grass and other green thing.  And again, by the tariff system, the whole revenue\n               is paid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly, the luxuries, and not\n               the necessaries of life.  By this system, the man who contents himself to live upon\n               the products of his own country, pays nothing at all.  And surely, that country is\n               extensive enough, and its products abundant and varied enough, to answer all the real\n               wants of its people.  In short, by this system, the burthen of revenue falls almost\n               entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many\n               who live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free. By the direct tax system, none can escape.  However strictly the citizen may exclude\n               from his premises, all foreign luxuries—fine clothes, fine silks, rich wines, golden\n               chains, and diamond rings; still, for the possession of his house, his barn, and his\n               homespun, he is to be perpetually haunted and harrassed by the tax-gatherer.  With these views we leave it to be determined, whether we or\n               our opponents are the more truly democratic on this subject. The third resolution declares the necessity and propriety of a National Bank.  During\n               the last fifty years so much has been said and written both as to the constitutionality\n               and expediency of such an institution, that we could not hope to improve in the least\n               on former discussions of the subject, were we to undertake it.  We, therefore, upon\n               the constitutionality, content ourselves with remarking the facts, that thefirst National Bankwas established chiefly by the same men who formed the constitution, at a time when\n               that instrument was but two years old, receiving the sanction, as President, of the\n               immortalWashigton; that thesecondreceived the sanction, as President, of Mr.Madison, to whom common consent has awarded the proud title of “Father of the Constitution;”\n               and subsequently the sanction of theSupreme Court, the most enlightened tribunal in the world. Upon the question of the expediency, we only ask you to examine the history of the\n               times, during the existence of the two Banks, and compare those times with the miserable\n               present. The fourth resolution declares the expediency of Mr.Clay’s Land Bill.5Much incomprehensible jargon is often urged against the constitutionality of this\n               measure.  We forbear, in this place, attempting to answer to it, simply because, in\n               our opinion, those who urge it, are, through party zeal, resolved not to see or acknowledge\n               the truth. The question of expediency, at least so far as Illinois is concerned, seems to us\n               the clearest imaginable.   By the bill, we are to receive annually a large sum of\n               money, no part of which we otherwise receive.  The precise annual sum cannot be known\n               in advance; it doubtless will vary in different years; still it is something to know,\n               that in last year,—a year of almost unparallelled pecuniary pressure—it amounted to more than forty thousand dollars. This annual income, in the midst of our almost insupportable difficulties, in the\n               days of our severest necessity, our political opponents are furiously resolving to\n               take and keep from us.6And for what? Many silly reasons are given, as is usual in cases, when a single\n               good one is not to be found.  One is, that by giving us the proceeds of the public\n               lands, we impoverish the National Treasury,  and thereby render necessary an increase\n               of the tariff.  This may be true, but if so, the amount of it only is, that those\n               whose pride, whose abundance of means, prompt them to spurn the manufactures of our\n               own country, and to strut in British cloaks, and coats, and pantaloons, may have to\n               pay a few cents more on the yard for the cloth that makes them.  A terrible evil,\n               truly, to the Illinois farmer, who never wore, nor never expects to wear, a single\n               yard of Brittish goods in his whole life. Another of their reasons is, that by the passage and continuance, of Mr. Clay’s bill,\n               we prevent the passage of a bill which would give us more.  This if it were sound,\n               in itself, is waging destructive war with the former position; for if Mr. Clay’s bill\n               impoverishes the Treasury too much, what shall be said of one that impoverishes it\n               still more?  But it is not sound in itself.  It is not true that Mr. Clay’s bill prevents\n               the passage of one more favorable to us of the new States.  Considering the strength\n               and opposite interest of the old States; the wonder is, that they ever permitted one\n               to pass so favorable as Mr. Clay’s.  The last twenty odd year’s efforts to reduce\n               the price of the lands, and to pass graduation bills, and cession Bills, prove the\n               assertion to be true; and even if there were no experience in support of it, the reason\n               itself is plain.  The States in which none, or few, of the public lands lie, and those\n               consequently interested against parting with them, except for the best price, are\n               the majority; and a moment’s reflection will show, that they must ever continue the\n               majority—because by the time one of the original new States (Ohiofor example) becomes populous, and gets weight inCongress, the public lands in her limits are nearly sold out, that in every point material\n               to this question, she becomes an old State.  She does not wish the price reduced,\n               because there is none left for her citizens to buy; she does not wish them ceded to\n               the States in which they lie, because they no longer lie in her limits, and she will\n               get nothing by the cession.  In the nature of things, the States interested in the\n               reduction of price, in graduation, in cession, and in all similar projects, never\n               can be the majority.  Nor is there reason to hope that any of them can ever succeed\n               as ademocratic partymeasure, because we have heretofore seen that party in full power, year after year,\n               with many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these projects, and\n               yet doing nothing. What reason then is there, to believe they will hereafter do better?\n               In every light in which we can view this question, it amounts simply to this.  Shall\n               we accept our share of the proceeds, under Mr. Clay’s bill; or shall we rather reject\n               that, and get nothing? The fifth resolution recommends that a Whig candidate for Congress be run in every\n               District, regardless of the chances of success. We are aware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification, when a friend cannot\n               succeed, to be able to choose between opponents; but we believe that that gratification\n               is the seed time which never fails to be followed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness.\n               By this policy we entangle ourselves.  By voting for our opponents, such of us as\n               do it, in some measure estop ourselves to complain of their acts, however glaringly\n               wrong we may believe them to be.  By this policy, no one portion of our friends, can\n               ever be certain as to what course another portion may adopt: and by this want of mutual\n               and perfect understanding, our political identity is partially frittered away and\n               lost.  And again, those who are thus elected by our aid, ever become our bitterest\n               prosecutors.  Take a few prominent examples: In 1830,Reynoldswas so elected Governor;7in 1835, we exerted our whole strength to electJudge Youngto theUnited States Senate, which effort, though failing, gave him the prominence that subsequently elected\n               him;8in 1836Gen. Ewingwas so elected to the United States Senate,9and yet let us ask what three men have been more perseveringly vindictive in their\n               assaults upon all our men and measures than they.  During the last summer the whole\n               State was covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us, methodized\n               into chapters and verses, written by two of these same men, Reynolds and Young; in\n               which they did not stop at charging us with error merely, but roundly denounced us\n               as the designing enemies of human liberty itself.  If it be the will of Heaven that\n               such men shall politically live, be it so, but never, never again permit them to draw\n               a particle of their sustenance from us. The sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the convention system for the nomination\n               of candidates. This we believe to be of the very first importance. Whether the system is right in\n               itself, we do not stop to enquire; contenting ourselves with trying to show, that\n               while our opponents use it, it is madness in us not to defend ourselves with it. \n               Experience has shown that we cannot successfully defend ourselves without it.  For\n               examples, look at the election last year.  Ourcandidatefor Governor, with the approbation of a large portion of the party, took the field\n               without a nomination, and in open opposition to the system.  Wherever in the counties\n               the whigs had held Conventions and nominated candidates for the Legislature, the aspirants,\n               who were not nominated, were induced to rebel against the nominations, and to become\n               candidates, as is said, “on their own hook.”  And go where you would into a large\n               whig county, you were sure to find the whigs, not contending shoulder to shoulder\n               against the common enemy, but divided into factions, and fighting furiously with one\n               another.—The election came, what was the result? TheGovernorbeaten, the whig vote being decreased many thousands since 1840, although the democratic\n               vote had not increased any.10Beaten almost every where for members of the Legislature.11Tazewell, with her four hundred whig majority, sending a delegation half democratic.12Vermillion, with her five hundred, doing the same.—13Coles, with her four hundred, sending two out of three;Morgan, with her two hundred and fifty, sending her three out of four; and this, to say\n               nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples; the whole winding up with the\n               aggregate number of twenty-seven democratic representatives sent from whig counties.\n               As to the Senators, too, the result was of the same character.  And it is most worthy\n               to be remembered, that of all the whigs in the State, who ran against the regular\n               nominees, a singleone onlywas elected.  Although they succeeded in defeating the nominees almost by scores,\n               they too, were defeated, and the spoils, chucklingly borne off by the common enemy. We do not mention the fact of many of the whigs opposing the Convention System heretofore,\n               for the purpose of censuring them.  Far from it.  We expressly protest against such\n               a conclusion.  We know they were generally, perhaps universally, as good and true\n               whigs, as we ourselves claim to be.  We mention it merely to draw attention to the\n               disastrous result it produced, as an example forever hereafter to be avoided. That “union is strength,” is a truth that has been known, illustrated and declared,\n               in various ways and forms in all ages of the world.  That great fabulist and philosopher,Æsop, illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks;14and he whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers, has declared that “a house\n               divided against itself cannot stand.”15It is to induce our friends to act upon this important, and universally acknowledged\n               truth, that we urge the adoption of the Convention SystemReflection will prove, that there is no other way of practically applying it.  In\n               its application, we know there will be incidents temporarily painful; but, after all,\n               we believe those incidents will be fewer and less intense, with, than without, the\n               system.  If two friends aspire to the same office, it is certain both cannot succeed.\n               Would it not, then, be much less painful to have the question decided by mutual friends\n               some time before, than to snarl and quarrel till the day of election, and then both\n               be beaten by the common enemy? Before leaving this subject, we think proper to remark that we do not understand the\n               resolution as intended to recommend the application of the Convention System to the\n               nomination of candidates for the small offices no way connected with politics; though\n               we must say, we do not perceive that such an application of it would be wrong. The seventh resolution recommends the holding of District Conventions in May next,\n               for the purpose of nominating candidates for Congress. The propriety of this, rests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth, and therefore\n               needs no further discussion. The eighth and ninth also, relate merely to the practical application of the foregoing\n               and therefore need no discussion. Before closing, permit us to add a few reflections on the whig party.  In almost all\n               the States we have fallen into the minority, and despondency seems to prevail universally\n               among us.  Is there just cause for this? In 1840 we carried the nation by more than\n               a hundred and forty thousand majority.  Our opponents charged that we did it by fraudulent\n               voting; but, whatevertheymay havebelieved,we knewthe charge to be untrue. Where now is that mighty host?  Have they gone over to the\n               enemy? Let the results of the late elections answer.  Every State which has fallen\n               off from the Whig cause since 1840 has done so, not by givingmoredemocratic votes than they did then, but by givingfewerWhig.16Bouck, who was electeddemocraticGovernor ofNew Yorklast fall by more than 15,000 majority, had not then as many votes as he had in 1840,\n               when he was beaten by seven or eight thousand.  And so has it been in all the other\n               States which have fallen away from our cause.  From this, it is evident, that tens\n               of thousands, in the late elections, have not voted at all.  Who and what are they?\n               is an important question, as respects the future.  Theycancome forward and give us the victory again.— That all, or nearly all of them, are\n               whigs, is most apparent.  Our opponents, stung to madness by thedefeat of 1840, have ever since rallied with more than their usual unanimity.  It has not beentheythat have been staid from the polls.  These facts show what the result must be, once\n               the people again rally in their entire strength.  Proclaim these facts and predict\n               this result, and, althoug unthinkingh opponents may smile at us, the sagacious ones will “believe and tremble.” And why\n               shall the whigs not all rally again? Are their principles less dear now than in 1840?\n               Have any of their doctrines, since then, been discovered to be untrue? It is true,\n               the victory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated, but it is equally\n               true, as we believe, that the unfortunate death ofGen. Harrisonwas the cause of the failure.17It was not the election of Gen. Harrison that was expected to produce happy effects,\n               but the measures to be adopted by his administration.  By means of his death, and\n               the unexpected course of this successor, those measures were never adopted.  How could\n               the fruits follow?—The consequence we always predicted, would follow the failure of\n               those measures, have followed, and are now upon us in all their horrors.  By the course\n               ofMr. Tylerthe policy of our opponents has continued in operation; still leaving them with the\n               advantage of charging all its evils upon us as the results of a whig administration.\n               Let none be deceived by this somewhat plausible, tho’[though] entirely false charge.  If they ask us for the sufficient and sound currency we promised,\n               letthembe answered, that we only promised it, through them[the] edium[medium] of  a National Bank, which, they aided by Mr. Tyler, prevented our establishing.\n               And, let them be reminded too, that their own policy in relation to the currency,\n               has all the time been, and still is, in full operation.  Let us then again come forth\n               in our might, and by a second victory, accomplish that, which death only prevented\n               in the first  We can do it—When did<Page 2>the whigs ever fail if they were fully aroused and united?  Even in single States\n               and Districts, under such circumstances, defeat seldom overtakes them.  Call to mind\n               the contested elections within the last few years, and particularly those ofMooreandLetcherfromKentucky;18NewlandandGrahamfromNorth Carolina,19and the famousNew Jerseycase.20In all those districtsLoco Focoismhad stalked omnipotent before; but when the whole people were aroused by its enormities,\n               on those occasions, they put it down never to rise again. We declare it to be our solemn conviction, that the whigs are always a majority of\n               this Nation; and that to make them always successful, needs but to get them all to\n               the polls, and vote unitedly.  This is the great desideratum.  Let us make every effort\n               to attain it—At every election, let every whig act as though he knew the result to\n               depend upon his action.  In thegreat contest of 1840, some more than twenty-one hundred thousand votes were cast—and so surely as there\n               shall be that many, with the ordinary increase added, cast in1844, that surely will a whig be elected President of the United States.",

      "ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OFILLINOIS.",
      "By a resolution of ameetingof such of theWhigsof theState, as are now atSpringfield, we, the undersigned, were appointed to prepare an address to you.  The performance\n               of the task we now undertake.",
      "Several resolutions were adopted by the meeting; and the chief object of this address\n               is, to show briefly, the reasons for their adoption.",
      "The first of those resolutions declares a tariff of duties upon foreign importations,\n               producing sufficient revenue for the support of the General Government, and so adjusted\n               as to protect American industry, to be indispensably necessary to the prosperity of\n               the Amercan People; and the second declares Direct Taxation for a National Revenue to be improper.\n               Those two resolutions are kindred in their nature, and therefore proper and convenient\n               to be considered together.  The question of protection is entirely too broad to be\n               crowded into a few pages only, together with several other subjects.  On that point,\n               we therefore content ourselves with giving the following extracts from the writings\n               of Mr.Jefferson,Gen. Jackson, and the speech of Mr.Calhoun:",
      "“To be independent for the comforts of life, we must fabricate them ourselves.—We\n               must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist.  The grand inquiry\n               now is, shall we make our own comforts, or go without them at the will of a foreign\n               nation? He, therefore, who is now against domestic manufactures must be for reducing\n               us either to dependence on that foreign nation, or to be clothed in skins and to live\n               like wild beasts, in dens and caverns.  I am not one of those; experience has taught\n               me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort.”\n               –Letter of Mr. Jefferson toBenjamin Austin.2",
      "“I ask, what is the real situation of the agriculturalist? Where has the American\n               farmer a market for his surplus produce? Except for cotton, he has neither a foreign\n               nor a home market.  Does not this clearly prove, when there is no market at home or\n               abroad, that there is too much labor employed in agriculture?  Common sense at once\n               points out the remedy.  Take from agriculture 600,000 men, women and children, and\n               you will at once give a market for more breadstuffs than allEuropenow furnishes.  In short, we have been too long subject to the policy of British\n               merchants.  It is time we should become a little moreAmericanized, and, instead of feeding the paupers and laborers ofEngland, feed our own; or else, in a short time, by continuing our present policy, we shall\n               all be rendered paupers ourselves.—Gen. Jackson’s letter to Dr.Coleman.3",
      "“When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon will be, under\n               the fostering care of Government, the farmer will find a ready market for his surplus\n               produce, and, what is of equal consequence, a certain and cheap supply of all he wants;\n               his prosperity will diffuse itself to every class of the community.”—Speech of Hon. J. C. Calhoun on the tariff.4",
      "The question of Revenue we will now briefly consider.  For several years past, the\n               revenues of the Government have been unequal to its expenditures, and consequently,\n               loan after loan, sometimes directly, and sometimes indirectly in form, have been resorted\n               to.  By this means a new National debt, has been created, and is still growing on\n               us with a rapidity fearful to contemplate—a rapidity only reasonably to be expected\n               in time of war.  This state of things has been produced by a prevailing unwillingness,\n               either to increase the tariff, or resort to direct taxation.  But the one or the other\n               must come.  Coming expenditures must be met, and the present debt must be paid; and\n               money cannot always be borrowed for these objects.  The system of loans is but temporary\n               in its nature, and must soon explode.  It is a system,  not only ruinous while it\n               lasts, but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute.  As an individual who undertakes\n               to live by borrowing, soon finds his original means devoured by interest, and next\n               no one left to borrow from—so must it be with a government.",
      "We repeat, then, that a tariff sufficient for revenue, or a direct tax, must soon\n               be resorted to; and, indeed, we believe this alternative is now denied by no one.\n               But which system shall be adopted?  Some of our opponents, in theory, admit the propriety\n               of a tariff sufficient for revenue; but even they, will not inpracticevote for such a tariff; while others boldly advocate direct taxation.  Inasmuch,\n               therefore, as some of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the rest, or so\n               nearly all, as to make exceptions needless, refuse to adopt the tariff—we think it\n               is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation. Indeed,\n               we believe, they are only delaying an open avowal of the system, till they can assure\n               themselves that the people will.  Let us then briefly compare the two systems.  The\n               tariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in large parcels\n               at a few commercial points, will require comparatively few officers in their collection;\n               while, by the direct tax system, the land must be literally covered with assessors\n               and collectors, going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade\n               of grass and other green thing.  And again, by the tariff system, the whole revenue\n               is paid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly, the luxuries, and not\n               the necessaries of life.  By this system, the man who contents himself to live upon\n               the products of his own country, pays nothing at all.  And surely, that country is\n               extensive enough, and its products abundant and varied enough, to answer all the real\n               wants of its people.  In short, by this system, the burthen of revenue falls almost\n               entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many\n               who live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free.",
      "By the direct tax system, none can escape.  However strictly the citizen may exclude\n               from his premises, all foreign luxuries—fine clothes, fine silks, rich wines, golden\n               chains, and diamond rings; still, for the possession of his house, his barn, and his\n               homespun, he is to be perpetually haunted and harrassed by the tax-gatherer.  With these views we leave it to be determined, whether we or\n               our opponents are the more truly democratic on this subject.",
      "The third resolution declares the necessity and propriety of a National Bank.  During\n               the last fifty years so much has been said and written both as to the constitutionality\n               and expediency of such an institution, that we could not hope to improve in the least\n               on former discussions of the subject, were we to undertake it.  We, therefore, upon\n               the constitutionality, content ourselves with remarking the facts, that thefirst National Bankwas established chiefly by the same men who formed the constitution, at a time when\n               that instrument was but two years old, receiving the sanction, as President, of the\n               immortalWashigton; that thesecondreceived the sanction, as President, of Mr.Madison, to whom common consent has awarded the proud title of “Father of the Constitution;”\n               and subsequently the sanction of theSupreme Court, the most enlightened tribunal in the world.",
      "Upon the question of the expediency, we only ask you to examine the history of the\n               times, during the existence of the two Banks, and compare those times with the miserable\n               present.",
      "The fourth resolution declares the expediency of Mr.Clay’s Land Bill.5Much incomprehensible jargon is often urged against the constitutionality of this\n               measure.  We forbear, in this place, attempting to answer to it, simply because, in\n               our opinion, those who urge it, are, through party zeal, resolved not to see or acknowledge\n               the truth.",
      "The question of expediency, at least so far as Illinois is concerned, seems to us\n               the clearest imaginable.   By the bill, we are to receive annually a large sum of\n               money, no part of which we otherwise receive.  The precise annual sum cannot be known\n               in advance; it doubtless will vary in different years; still it is something to know,\n               that in last year,—a year of almost unparallelled pecuniary pressure—it amounted to more than forty thousand dollars.",
      "This annual income, in the midst of our almost insupportable difficulties, in the\n               days of our severest necessity, our political opponents are furiously resolving to\n               take and keep from us.6And for what? Many silly reasons are given, as is usual in cases, when a single\n               good one is not to be found.  One is, that by giving us the proceeds of the public\n               lands, we impoverish the National Treasury,  and thereby render necessary an increase\n               of the tariff.  This may be true, but if so, the amount of it only is, that those\n               whose pride, whose abundance of means, prompt them to spurn the manufactures of our\n               own country, and to strut in British cloaks, and coats, and pantaloons, may have to\n               pay a few cents more on the yard for the cloth that makes them.  A terrible evil,\n               truly, to the Illinois farmer, who never wore, nor never expects to wear, a single\n               yard of Brittish goods in his whole life.",
      "Another of their reasons is, that by the passage and continuance, of Mr. Clay’s bill,\n               we prevent the passage of a bill which would give us more.  This if it were sound,\n               in itself, is waging destructive war with the former position; for if Mr. Clay’s bill\n               impoverishes the Treasury too much, what shall be said of one that impoverishes it\n               still more?  But it is not sound in itself.  It is not true that Mr. Clay’s bill prevents\n               the passage of one more favorable to us of the new States.  Considering the strength\n               and opposite interest of the old States; the wonder is, that they ever permitted one\n               to pass so favorable as Mr. Clay’s.  The last twenty odd year’s efforts to reduce\n               the price of the lands, and to pass graduation bills, and cession Bills, prove the\n               assertion to be true; and even if there were no experience in support of it, the reason\n               itself is plain.  The States in which none, or few, of the public lands lie, and those\n               consequently interested against parting with them, except for the best price, are\n               the majority; and a moment’s reflection will show, that they must ever continue the\n               majority—because by the time one of the original new States (Ohiofor example) becomes populous, and gets weight inCongress, the public lands in her limits are nearly sold out, that in every point material\n               to this question, she becomes an old State.  She does not wish the price reduced,\n               because there is none left for her citizens to buy; she does not wish them ceded to\n               the States in which they lie, because they no longer lie in her limits, and she will\n               get nothing by the cession.  In the nature of things, the States interested in the\n               reduction of price, in graduation, in cession, and in all similar projects, never\n               can be the majority.  Nor is there reason to hope that any of them can ever succeed\n               as ademocratic partymeasure, because we have heretofore seen that party in full power, year after year,\n               with many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these projects, and\n               yet doing nothing. What reason then is there, to believe they will hereafter do better?\n               In every light in which we can view this question, it amounts simply to this.  Shall\n               we accept our share of the proceeds, under Mr. Clay’s bill; or shall we rather reject\n               that, and get nothing?",
      "The fifth resolution recommends that a Whig candidate for Congress be run in every\n               District, regardless of the chances of success.",
      "We are aware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification, when a friend cannot\n               succeed, to be able to choose between opponents; but we believe that that gratification\n               is the seed time which never fails to be followed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness.\n               By this policy we entangle ourselves.  By voting for our opponents, such of us as\n               do it, in some measure estop ourselves to complain of their acts, however glaringly\n               wrong we may believe them to be.  By this policy, no one portion of our friends, can\n               ever be certain as to what course another portion may adopt: and by this want of mutual\n               and perfect understanding, our political identity is partially frittered away and\n               lost.  And again, those who are thus elected by our aid, ever become our bitterest\n               prosecutors.  Take a few prominent examples: In 1830,Reynoldswas so elected Governor;7in 1835, we exerted our whole strength to electJudge Youngto theUnited States Senate, which effort, though failing, gave him the prominence that subsequently elected\n               him;8in 1836Gen. Ewingwas so elected to the United States Senate,9and yet let us ask what three men have been more perseveringly vindictive in their\n               assaults upon all our men and measures than they.  During the last summer the whole\n               State was covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us, methodized\n               into chapters and verses, written by two of these same men, Reynolds and Young; in\n               which they did not stop at charging us with error merely, but roundly denounced us\n               as the designing enemies of human liberty itself.  If it be the will of Heaven that\n               such men shall politically live, be it so, but never, never again permit them to draw\n               a particle of their sustenance from us.",
      "The sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the convention system for the nomination\n               of candidates.",
      "This we believe to be of the very first importance. Whether the system is right in\n               itself, we do not stop to enquire; contenting ourselves with trying to show, that\n               while our opponents use it, it is madness in us not to defend ourselves with it. \n               Experience has shown that we cannot successfully defend ourselves without it.  For\n               examples, look at the election last year.  Ourcandidatefor Governor, with the approbation of a large portion of the party, took the field\n               without a nomination, and in open opposition to the system.  Wherever in the counties\n               the whigs had held Conventions and nominated candidates for the Legislature, the aspirants,\n               who were not nominated, were induced to rebel against the nominations, and to become\n               candidates, as is said, “on their own hook.”  And go where you would into a large\n               whig county, you were sure to find the whigs, not contending shoulder to shoulder\n               against the common enemy, but divided into factions, and fighting furiously with one\n               another.—The election came, what was the result? TheGovernorbeaten, the whig vote being decreased many thousands since 1840, although the democratic\n               vote had not increased any.10Beaten almost every where for members of the Legislature.11Tazewell, with her four hundred whig majority, sending a delegation half democratic.12Vermillion, with her five hundred, doing the same.—13Coles, with her four hundred, sending two out of three;Morgan, with her two hundred and fifty, sending her three out of four; and this, to say\n               nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples; the whole winding up with the\n               aggregate number of twenty-seven democratic representatives sent from whig counties.\n               As to the Senators, too, the result was of the same character.  And it is most worthy\n               to be remembered, that of all the whigs in the State, who ran against the regular\n               nominees, a singleone onlywas elected.  Although they succeeded in defeating the nominees almost by scores,\n               they too, were defeated, and the spoils, chucklingly borne off by the common enemy.",
      "We do not mention the fact of many of the whigs opposing the Convention System heretofore,\n               for the purpose of censuring them.  Far from it.  We expressly protest against such\n               a conclusion.  We know they were generally, perhaps universally, as good and true\n               whigs, as we ourselves claim to be.  We mention it merely to draw attention to the\n               disastrous result it produced, as an example forever hereafter to be avoided.",
      "That “union is strength,” is a truth that has been known, illustrated and declared,\n               in various ways and forms in all ages of the world.  That great fabulist and philosopher,Æsop, illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks;14and he whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers, has declared that “a house\n               divided against itself cannot stand.”15It is to induce our friends to act upon this important, and universally acknowledged\n               truth, that we urge the adoption of the Convention SystemReflection will prove, that there is no other way of practically applying it.  In\n               its application, we know there will be incidents temporarily painful; but, after all,\n               we believe those incidents will be fewer and less intense, with, than without, the\n               system.  If two friends aspire to the same office, it is certain both cannot succeed.\n               Would it not, then, be much less painful to have the question decided by mutual friends\n               some time before, than to snarl and quarrel till the day of election, and then both\n               be beaten by the common enemy?",
      "Before leaving this subject, we think proper to remark that we do not understand the\n               resolution as intended to recommend the application of the Convention System to the\n               nomination of candidates for the small offices no way connected with politics; though\n               we must say, we do not perceive that such an application of it would be wrong.",
      "The seventh resolution recommends the holding of District Conventions in May next,\n               for the purpose of nominating candidates for Congress.",
      "The propriety of this, rests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth, and therefore\n               needs no further discussion.",
      "The eighth and ninth also, relate merely to the practical application of the foregoing\n               and therefore need no discussion.",
      "Before closing, permit us to add a few reflections on the whig party.  In almost all\n               the States we have fallen into the minority, and despondency seems to prevail universally\n               among us.  Is there just cause for this? In 1840 we carried the nation by more than\n               a hundred and forty thousand majority.  Our opponents charged that we did it by fraudulent\n               voting; but, whatevertheymay havebelieved,we knewthe charge to be untrue. Where now is that mighty host?  Have they gone over to the\n               enemy? Let the results of the late elections answer.  Every State which has fallen\n               off from the Whig cause since 1840 has done so, not by givingmoredemocratic votes than they did then, but by givingfewerWhig.16Bouck, who was electeddemocraticGovernor ofNew Yorklast fall by more than 15,000 majority, had not then as many votes as he had in 1840,\n               when he was beaten by seven or eight thousand.  And so has it been in all the other\n               States which have fallen away from our cause.  From this, it is evident, that tens\n               of thousands, in the late elections, have not voted at all.  Who and what are they?\n               is an important question, as respects the future.  Theycancome forward and give us the victory again.— That all, or nearly all of them, are\n               whigs, is most apparent.  Our opponents, stung to madness by thedefeat of 1840, have ever since rallied with more than their usual unanimity.  It has not beentheythat have been staid from the polls.  These facts show what the result must be, once\n               the people again rally in their entire strength.  Proclaim these facts and predict\n               this result, and, althoug unthinkingh opponents may smile at us, the sagacious ones will “believe and tremble.” And why\n               shall the whigs not all rally again? Are their principles less dear now than in 1840?\n               Have any of their doctrines, since then, been discovered to be untrue? It is true,\n               the victory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated, but it is equally\n               true, as we believe, that the unfortunate death ofGen. Harrisonwas the cause of the failure.17It was not the election of Gen. Harrison that was expected to produce happy effects,\n               but the measures to be adopted by his administration.  By means of his death, and\n               the unexpected course of this successor, those measures were never adopted.  How could\n               the fruits follow?—The consequence we always predicted, would follow the failure of\n               those measures, have followed, and are now upon us in all their horrors.  By the course\n               ofMr. Tylerthe policy of our opponents has continued in operation; still leaving them with the\n               advantage of charging all its evils upon us as the results of a whig administration.\n               Let none be deceived by this somewhat plausible, tho’[though] entirely false charge.  If they ask us for the sufficient and sound currency we promised,\n               letthembe answered, that we only promised it, through them[the] edium[medium] of  a National Bank, which, they aided by Mr. Tyler, prevented our establishing.\n               And, let them be reminded too, that their own policy in relation to the currency,\n               has all the time been, and still is, in full operation.  Let us then again come forth\n               in our might, and by a second victory, accomplish that, which death only prevented\n               in the first  We can do it—When did<Page 2>the whigs ever fail if they were fully aroused and united?  Even in single States\n               and Districts, under such circumstances, defeat seldom overtakes them.  Call to mind\n               the contested elections within the last few years, and particularly those ofMooreandLetcherfromKentucky;18NewlandandGrahamfromNorth Carolina,19and the famousNew Jerseycase.20In all those districtsLoco Focoismhad stalked omnipotent before; but when the whole people were aroused by its enormities,\n               on those occasions, they put it down never to rise again.",
      "We declare it to be our solemn conviction, that the whigs are always a majority of\n               this Nation; and that to make them always successful, needs but to get them all to\n               the polls, and vote unitedly.  This is the great desideratum.  Let us make every effort\n               to attain it—At every election, let every whig act as though he knew the result to\n               depend upon his action.  In thegreat contest of 1840, some more than twenty-one hundred thousand votes were cast—and so surely as there\n               shall be that many, with the ordinary increase added, cast in1844, that surely will a whig be elected President of the United States."

By this means a new National debt, has been created, and is still growing on\n               us with a rapidity fearful to contemplate—a rapidity only reasonably to be expected\n               in time of war.  This state of things has been produced by a prevailing unwillingness,\n               either to increase the tariff, or resort to direct taxation.  But the one or the other\n               must come.  Coming expenditures must be met, and the present debt must be paid; and\n               money cannot always be borrowed for these objects.  The system of loans is but temporary\n               in its nature, and must soon explode.  It is a system,  not only ruinous while it\n               lasts, but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute.  As an individual who undertakes\n               to live by borrowing, soon finds his original means devoured by interest, and next\n               no one left to borrow from—so must it be with a government."

Some of our opponents, in theory, admit the propriety\n               of a tariff sufficient for revenue; but even they, will not inpracticevote for such a tariff; while others boldly advocate direct taxation.  Inasmuch,\n               therefore, as some of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the rest, or so\n               nearly all, as to make exceptions needless, refuse to adopt the tariff—we think it\n               is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation. Indeed,\n               we believe, they are only delaying an open avowal of the system, till they can assure\n               themselves that the people will.  Let us then briefly compare the two systems.  The\n               tariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in large parcels\n               at a few commercial points, will require comparatively few officers in their collection;\n               while, by the direct tax system, the land must be literally covered with assessors\n               and collectors, going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade\n               of grass and other green thing.  And again, by the tariff system, the whole revenue\n               is paid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly, the luxuries, and not\n               the necessaries of life.  By this system, the man who contents himself to live upon\n               the products of his own country, pays nothing at all.  And surely, that country is\n               extensive enough, and its products abundant and varied enough, to answer all the real\n               wants of its people.  In short, by this system, the burthen of revenue falls almost\n               entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many\n               who live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free."

But it is not sound in itself.  It is not true that Mr. Clay’s bill prevents\n               the passage of one more favorable to us of the new States.  Considering the strength\n               and opposite interest of the old States; the wonder is, that they ever permitted one\n               to pass so favorable as Mr. Clay’s.  The last twenty odd year’s efforts to reduce\n               the price of the lands, and to pass graduation bills, and cession Bills, prove the\n               assertion to be true; and even if there were no experience in support of it, the reason\n               itself is plain.  The States in which none, or few, of the public lands lie, and those\n               consequently interested against parting with them, except for the best price, are\n               the majority; and a moment’s reflection will show, that they must ever continue the\n               majority—because by the time one of the original new States (Ohiofor example) becomes populous, and gets weight inCongress, the public lands in her limits are nearly sold out, that in every point material\n               to this question, she becomes an old State.  She does not wish the price reduced,\n               because there is none left for her citizens to buy; she does not wish them ceded to\n               the States in which they lie, because they no longer lie in her limits, and she will\n               get nothing by the cession.  In the nature of things, the States interested in the\n               reduction of price, in graduation, in cession, and in all similar projects, never\n               can be the majority.  Nor is there reason to hope that any of them can ever succeed\n               as ademocratic partymeasure, because we have heretofore seen that party in full power, year after year,\n               with many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these projects, and\n               yet doing nothing. What reason then is there, to believe they will hereafter do better?\n               In every light in which we can view this question, it amounts simply to this.  Shall\n               we accept our share of the proceeds, under Mr. Clay’s bill; or shall we rather reject\n               that, and get nothing?"

Who and what are they?\n               is an important question, as respects the future.  Theycancome forward and give us the victory again.— That all, or nearly all of them, are\n               whigs, is most apparent.  Our opponents, stung to madness by thedefeat of 1840, have ever since rallied with more than their usual unanimity.  It has not beentheythat have been staid from the polls.

It is true,\n               the victory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated, but it is equally\n               true, as we believe, that the unfortunate death ofGen.

Call to mind\n               the contested elections within the last few years, and particularly those ofMooreandLetcherfromKentucky;18NewlandandGrahamfromNorth Carolina,19and the famousNew Jerseycase.20In all those districtsLoco Focoismhad stalked omnipotent before; but when the whole people were aroused by its enormities,\n               on those occasions, they put it down never to rise again."

This is the great desideratum.  Let us make every effort\n               to attain it—At every election, let every whig act as though he knew the result to\n               depend upon his action.  In thegreat contest of 1840, some more than twenty-one hundred thousand votes were cast—and so surely as there\n               shall be that many, with the ordinary increase added, cast in1844, that surely will a whig be elected President of the United States."
