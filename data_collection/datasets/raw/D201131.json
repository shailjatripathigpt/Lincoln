        "text": "2In the state elections of 1858, John Moses ran as aRepublicanfor anIllinois Senateseat in the Thirteenth Senate District that includedScott,Pike, andCalhouncounties. Moses earned 653 votes, losing toDemocratChauncey L. Higbee, who amassed 1,000 votes.Abraham Lincolnwas the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of Representativesand Illinois Senate were of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned\n                  extensively in Illinois in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning\n                  on behalf of Republican candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,\n                  DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  In local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but Pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection.
