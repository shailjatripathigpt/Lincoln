Douglas at the firstLincoln-Douglas Debate, held at Ottawa, Illinois, on August 21, 1858, which was published  in theChicago Tribuneof August 23, 1858, along with Douglas’ speeches at the debate. Lincoln was at this\n                  time running against incumbent senator Douglas to representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate, having been nominated at the1858 Illinois Republican Convention. Asproposedby Douglas, the debates followed a format of one candidate speaking for an hour,\n                  followed by a one and a half hour response by the other candidate, and finally a half\n                  hour rebuttal by the first speaker. Douglas and Lincoln would alternate who spoke\n                  first, with Douglas speaking first at the odd numbered debates and Lincoln at the\n                  even. At the Ottawa debate, Douglas spoke first, followed by a reply from Lincoln,\n                  then a final rebuttal by Douglas.

        "text": "4In his opening speech at the Ottawa debate, Douglas charged Lincoln with having helped\n                  to draft an antislaveryRepublican Partyplatform inSpringfieldin October of 1854. In making this allegation, Douglas mistakenly quoted a more radical\n                  platform passed at a Republican meeting inAurora, Illinois, that same year rather than the actual Springfield platform. In his response at Ottawa,\n                  Lincoln denied having assisted in composing the Springfield platform, not realizing\n                  that Douglas was quoting the incorrect platform. TheChicago Daily Press and Tribunepointed out the error, calling the resolutions as cited by Douglas “FRAUDS AND FORGERIES\n                  FROM FIRST TO LAST” and alleging that the substitution was intentional and that Douglas\n                  “basely, maliciously and wilfully LIED.”First Debate with Stephen A.

        "text": "5Jordan is quoting from  a speech given by Lyman Trumbull inChicagoon August 7, 1858, on his return to Illinois following the adjournment of the U.S.\n                  Senate. In this speech Trumbull pledged to “cram the truth down any honest man’s throat,\n                  until he cannot deny it” and stated that for anyone who denied the charge in question,\n                  he would “cram the lie down his throat, until he shall cry enough.”The claim that Trumbull promised in this speech to so forcefully argue was that Douglas\n                  had altered a bill introduced to the U.S. Senate in June of 1856 by Robert A. Toombs,\n                  and that he did so in a manner that denied popular sovereignty to the people ofKansas Territory. Toombs’ bill provided for a path to a state constitutional convention for Kansas.\n                  When the bill was reported by the U.S. Senate Committee on Territories, of which Douglas\n                  was chairman, it no longer included a provision for the residents of Kansas to vote\n                  on any proposed constitution, and Trumbull alleged that Douglas had removed this provision.\n                  In the fourth Lincoln-Douglas Debate inCharlestonon September 18, 1858, Lincoln shifted tactics on this subject from simply attesting\n                  to Trumbull’s honesty, to arguing that Douglas had made the change.Ralph J.

In contrast, the platform adopted\n                  by the Illinois Republican Party at Springfield in 1854 included resolutions recognizing\n                  the right and duty of the federal government to prohibit slavery in territories, arguing\n                  that the doctrines of non-intervention and popular sovereignty introduced by theKansas Nebraska Actthreatened to undo federal limits on slavery and make it a national, rather than\n                  a local institution, and stating that any absence in the law in regard to slavery\n                  presumed the existence of a freedom, as slavery existed solely by virtue of positive\n                  law.First Debate with Stephen A.
