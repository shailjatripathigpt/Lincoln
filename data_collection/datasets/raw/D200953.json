        "text": "3Jacob Warner and Cyrus Conkling were among a group of men local toRock Island Countywho acted together in the spring of 1857 to attempt to claim land on the island ofRock Islandthrough pre-emption. Pre-emption refers to “the right of a settler of a tract of\n                  public land to purchase it before other applicants.” Warner and Conkling both settled\n                  on the island on April 10, 1857, and through Lincoln filed declaratory statements\n                  of pre-emption at theSpringfield Land Officeon May 9. Rock Island, however, was subject to competing claims of ownership, some\n                  by earlier settlers who had apparently failed to file pre-emption claims, and arguments\n                  ensued. Lincoln attempted unsuccessfully to file proofs of pre-emption for Warner\n                  and Conkling with Springfield Land Office  registerJohn Connelly, Sr., later in the year, but Connelly refused to accept them. Members of Warner and Conkling’s\n                  group went to Springfield themselves in April 1858 to prove title, but theGeneral Land OfficeinWashington, DCprohibited further action at that time and announced that theU.S. War Departmentintended to sell the land at public auction as a military reservation. Ownership\n                  of land on Rock Island was still unsettled on the advent of the Civil War, but when\n                  theU.S. Congressestablished an arsenal on the island in 1862, the remaining settlers relinquished\n                  their pre-emption claims.D.
