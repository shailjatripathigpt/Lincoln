However,\n                  it undoubtedly was a response to Henderson'sletterto Lincoln from June 19, when Henderson invited Lincoln to Oquawka during his1858 campaignfor theU.S. Senate.  Lincoln was the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate.   In the summer and fall\n                  of 1858, he crisscrossedIllinoisdelivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran againstDemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.
