Neale had been the surveyor forSangamon Countyresponsible for surveying the land donated to secure the county seat for Springfield.\n                  Lincoln had served as Neale’s assistant.  At the time of his correspondence with Lincoln,\n                  Ledlie was the county surveyor.Ledlie wrote this letter as part of property disputes that Lincoln was handling forHarriet B. Neale, Thomas M. Neale’s widow. In November 1850, Harriet B. Neale retainedLincoln & Herndonand suedGrover AyersandIsaac S. Brittonin actions of ejectment in theSangamon County Circuit Courtfor unlawfully withholding property from her.  In both cases, the parties reached\n                  an agreement, and the court awarded the properties to Ayres and Britton, respectively.\n                  Lincoln took no fee from Mrs. Neale.On March 11, 1851, LincolnwroteLedlie regarding these cases.John M.
