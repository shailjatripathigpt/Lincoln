There is no evidence that Lincoln met\n                  with Montague during the convention.  No letters from Abraham Lincoln to Montague\n                  have been found. Montague did not run for any state or federal office in1858.Delegates to the state convention unanimously nominated Lincoln as the Republican\n                  candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. In the summer and fall of 1858, he crisscrossed Illinois delivering speeches and\n                  campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for theIllinois General Assembly. At this time the Illinois General Assembly elected the state’s representatives in\n                  the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He ran against, and lost to,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent.
