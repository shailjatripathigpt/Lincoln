        "text": "5Opponents of theKansas-Nebraska ActinIllinoishoped to enlist German-Americans in the coalition they were building to challengeDemocratsin the1856 Federal Election.  At theIllinois Anti-Nebraska Conventionin May 1856, delegates nominatedFrancis A. Hoffman, a prominent German-American politician, as their candidate for lieutenant governor\n                  to that end.  They also selected Friedrich K. F. Hecker as a presidential elector.\n                  Hecker’s selection obligated him to make political speeches to German-American audiences\n                  on behalf ofJohn C. Fremont, theRepublicancandidate for president, and other Republican candidates for office.  Hecker made\n                  his first speech atMascoutah, Illinois, on June 28, 1856.On August 12, Hecker’s house nearBellevilleburned to the ground.  Hecker and others suspected arson in retribution for his political\n                  activism on behalf of the Republican Party.Sabine Freitag,Friedrich Hecker: Two Lives for Liberty, trans. by Steven Rowan (St. Louis: St. Louis Mercantile Library, University of Missouri–St.\n                     Louis, 2006), 167-68, 171, 174-75;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 14 August 1856, 3:1."

During the 1856 election campaign, Lincoln not only organized the distribution\n                  of pro-Republican German-language newspapers; he also advocated for German speakers\n                  such as Hecker to deliver addresses at Republican political meetings. On September\n                  14, LincolnwroteHecker directly to offer financial support and encourage him to campaign for Fremont.Although less inclined to travel after the fire, Hecker was not dissuaded from participating\n                  in the campaign.  German-language newspapers published portions of his “Address to\n                  the German Population of the United States” in mid-August, and within six weeks of\n                  the fire, he was speaking on the East Coast.Although Democrat candidateJames Buchananwon the presidency, carrying Illinois with 44.1 percent of the vote, the Republican\n                  Party won more than half of the state’s German vote and swept the races for every\n                  state office.
