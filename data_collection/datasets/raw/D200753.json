Taylor a promissory note for $100, but failed\n                  to pay. After Taylor died in August 1842, Hays became the administrator of his estate.\n                  In April 1851, Hays retained Lincoln and sued Turley in the Logan County Circuit Court\n                  to collect the debt.In October 1852, LincolnwroteHays that he had agreed to give Turley a few months to find evidence supporting his\n                  claim that Taylor had promised to destroy the note and forgive the debt. Lincoln justified\n                  the action by writing that he felt sorry for Turley, “poorand acrippleas he is.”  Turley produced two witnesses, but on September 7, the court ruled for\n                  Hays, ordering Turley to pay the estate $116.90.  Lincoln kept $16.90 as a fee for\n                  his legal services.Lincoln enclosed a bank draft for $100 in aletterto Hays sent in November 1853.Receipt, Document ID: 83371,Hays v.
