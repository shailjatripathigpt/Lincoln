        "text": "3In the1856 Federal Election,Republicansnominated John C. Fremont as their first presidential candidate, while Democrats\n                  nominated James Buchanan. The American Party, in its final participation in a presidential\n                  election, nominated Millard Fillmore. Republicans, concerned that two opposition tickets\n                  would favor the Democrats,exploredcampaign strategies to ensure their candidate, Fremont, would be elected. In alettertoJames Berdanin July 1856, Lincoln suggested a possible fusion ticket, bringing together supporters\n                  of the American and Republican parties. In the end, Lincolnimplementeda mail campaign, sending form letters to Fillmore supporters informing them that\n                  every vote for their candidate in Illinois lessened his chance of becoming president.\n                  This document provided the foundation for those letters.Lincoln and his fellow Republicans failed to convince Fillmore’s supporters to unite,\n                  allowing Democrats to label their opponents as both nativists and worshippers of African\n                  Americans. Lincoln’s prediction proved prophetic: Buchanan captured Illinois with\n                  44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont and 15.7 for Fillmore, and Buchanan\n                  defeated Fremont and Fillmore to become fifteenth president of the United States.\n                  Indeed, if the votes received by Fremont and Fillmore in Illinois had been combined,\n                  Buchanan’s vote would not have been sufficient to carry the state.Thomas A.
