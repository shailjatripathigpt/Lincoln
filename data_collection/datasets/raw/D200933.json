However,\n                  in the summer of 1860 Lincoln made a note in the margins of page forty-one ofSamuel C. Parks’ personal copy ofWilliam D. Howells’Lives and Speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin, noting, “I first saw Douglas atVandalia, Dec. 1834–” Therefore, the editors date this document at approximately December\n                  1856.Lives and Speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin(Columbus, OH: Follett, Foster, 1860), inside cover, 41, Lincoln Collection, Abraham\n                     Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Springfield, IL."

        "text": "2Throughout December 1834, Lincoln was in Vandalia, Illinois serving in theIllinois House of Representatives. Vandalia was, at that time, the capital ofIllinoisand the site where legislative sessions were held. Stephen A. Douglas traveled to\n                  Vandalia in late-1834 at the request of Illinois representativeJohn Wyatt, a freshly re-elected fellowDemocratfor whom Douglas had written a bill designed to take the power to appoint state’s\n                  attorneys away from the governor of Illinois (thenJoseph Duncan) and give the power to elect state’s attorneys to theIllinois General Assembly. Douglas also lobbied in Vandalia for himself for state’s attorney, and it was during\n                  this canvassing that Lincoln first became acquainted with Douglas,  famously describing\n                  him at that time as “theleastman I ever saw.” In February 1835, the Illinois General Assembly passed the bill\n                  Douglas wrote and, soon after, also elected Douglas state’s attorney.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, December 1834,http://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1834&month=12; Louis L.
