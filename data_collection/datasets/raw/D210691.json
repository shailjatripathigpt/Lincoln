        "text": "2In January 1858, Abraham Lincoln andWilliam H. HerndonrepresentedSamuel C. Davis and Companyin a lawsuit in theUnited States District Court, Southern District of Illinois. The company had received a promissory note for $712.16 from Robinson Warner. When\n                  Warner failed to pay, Samuel C. Davis and Company retained Lincoln and Herndon and\n                  sued him for $1,000. Warner also failed to appear in court, and the company was awarded\n                  $744.99 in January 1858. However, in order for the awarded money to be acquired, some\n                  of Warner’s land needed to be sold. Lincoln wrote to Davis and Company on November 17, 1858, after they had complained of waiting an\n                  excessive amount of time to be paid. Lincoln explained that, “the selling of land\n                  on execution is a delicate and dangerous, matter,” and, “that it could not be done\n                  safely, without a careful examination of titles, and also of thevalueof the property–” Lincoln continued to note that in order to complete these tasks,\n                  “would require a canvass of half the State.” This letter refers to Lincoln’s interest\n                  in hiring Fishback to complete said canvass.S.

He spent three or four weeks and more than a hundred dollars of his own money\n                  to visit every locality where Warner owned land and report on all of the land and\n                  titles. Fishback was finally paid $100 by Lincoln and Herndon, through Samuel C. Davis\n                  & Company, in December 1858. Although Fishback had moved toArkansas, Lincoln suggested that he return to Illinois and make a career in performing similar\n                  work for future lawsuit judgments. Fishback remained in Arkansas.Abraham Lincoln to Samuel C. Davis & Company; Abraham Lincoln to William M. Fishback;  Carl H.
