        "text": "2Lincoln and Joseph Gillespie had been together inEdwardsville, Illinois, on September 11, 1858, when Gillespie officiated a Republican meeting  during which\n                  Lincoln delivered a  speech.  Lincoln spoke on the evening of September 11 atHighland, Illinois, and the next day Gillespie drove Lincoln in his buggy to Lincoln’s next appointment\n                  inGreenville, Illinois.The New York American, orKnow Nothing, Party held its annual Grand Council inAlbanyon August 24, 1858. At the meeting, the waning third party set their annual state\n                  convention for September 8 in Syracuse to coincide with the Republican convention and pave the way for a possible alliance.\n                  While the majority of council members approved of an American and Republican alliance,\n                  about a quarter of the council rejected Republicans for their history of outspoken\n                  disdain for nativism.The American and Republican conventions on September 8 commenced with a positive outlook\n                  toward a unification. Both parties agreed on a platform that softened antislavery\n                  rhetoric and hinted at nativism. However, last minute changes to the platform by a\n                  Republican committee infuriated the Americans and the chance of a union was destroyed.\n                  The American Party put forth their own nominations despite the reality that they would\n                  never have the support to win any office.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 11 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-11; 12 September 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-09-12; Douglas L.

        "text": "3On the next Saturday, September 18,Madison Countymembers of the American and Republican parties gathered in Edwardsville  under the\n                  label of The Peoples County Convention. The meeting gathered between four and five\n                  hundred men, all with a “sincere desire to bring about such a union of parties, and\n                  nominate such men as would preserve Madison county from the stigma of favoring Slavery\n                  extension, or any of the corruptions of the present Administration.” Delegates nominated\n                  Gillespie for theIllinois Senatein the Twenty-First District, which includedBond, Madison, andMontgomerycounties, andCurtis Blakemanand Isaac Cox forIllinois House of Representativesin the Madison County’s District Fourteen.Abraham Lincoln was the Republican candidate fromIllinoisfor theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of Representativesand Illinois Senate were of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned\n                  extensively in Illinois in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning\n                  on behalf of Republican candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent,DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Among the former Whigs whose votes were courted were those who had moved into the\n                  American Party following the dissolution of the Whig Party. Former members of the\n                  American Party, often referred to colloquially as \"Fillmore Men\" because the national\n                  party backedMillard Fillmorein thepresidential election of 1856, were an important source of votes for both Democrats and Republicans in the state\n                  and federal elections of 1858, and both Lincoln and Douglas worked hard to garner\n                  their support.  In state elections of 1856, Madison County had sent two American Party\n                  members to the Illinois House of Representatives, and in the presidential contest,\n                  Bond, Madison, and Montgomery counties gave Fillmore 46.4, 39.3, and 37.2 percent\n                  of the vote, respectively.  Lincoln expressed his concern in a previousletterto Gillespie that the overwhelming number of votes cast for American Party candidate\n                  Millard Fillmore in the 1856 presidential election in the Twenty-First District meant\n                  that a large number of voters could now be swayed to vote either Democrat or Republican.\n                  In statewide local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but Pro-Douglas\n                  Democrats retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection.  Madison\n                  County sent DemocratsZephaniah B. JobandJoseph H. Slossto the Illinois House, and DemocratSamuel A. Buckmasterdefeated  Gillespie by 184 votes in the Senate District Twenty-One.  Buckmaster,\n                  Job, and Sloss all voted for Douglas in the Senate election.
