        "text": "3The “little editorial paragraph” that Lincoln references appeared in the context of\n                  Wentworth’s vote on June 21 not to reconsider the vote engrossing amail route bill, which theTribunecontended contained amendments that extended mail routes to the Rio Grande, which\n                  Greeley and his Washington correspondent interpreted as Wentworth abandoning theWilmot Proviso.  The Washington correspondent made this charge on June 23, and Wentworth wrote Greeley\n                  on the same day refuting the charge, arguing that he hoped by so voting to prevent\n                  a long discussion on the border of Texas and therefore save the bill. As for the Wilmot\n                  Proviso and the extension of slavery, Wentworth affirmed that “I never have voted\n                  against any such Proviso, and never expect to.”  Lincoln voted to reconsider the vote\n                  for engrossment, but the motion failed.New-York Daily Tribune, 23 June 1848, 2:4; 26 June 1848, 2:2, 5;  U.S. HouseJournal. 1848. 30th Cong., 1st sess., 931-32."
