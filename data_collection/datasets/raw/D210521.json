However, in early June 1849\n                  Lincoln sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting letters in support\n                  of his candidacy for commissioner of theU.S. General Land Office. Presumably, Lincoln made a similar request of Webb. Originally,Justin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, and Cyrus Edwards were vying to become commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office.\n                  Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored over Morrison\n                  and Edwards.

        "text": "6In the winter of 1848-49, Webb wrote Lincoln two letters regarding an appointment\n                  for Charles H. Constable in President Taylor’s administration, neither of which has\n                  been located. In April 1849, Webb again wrote Lincoln aletterasking for help securing Constable an appointment. On May 3, 1849, Lincoln also received\n                  aletterfromJustin Harlansoliciting his assistance on Constable’s behalf. On May 5, 1849, Constable wrote\n                  Lincoln aletterafter being unable to meet with him to discuss the topic. On May 13, Lincoln wrote\n                  aletterof introduction on Constable’s behalf to Secretary of StateJohn M. Clayton. Constable’s name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so apparently he did not receive an appointment.As competition for the job as commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office intensified,William H. HendersonandJosiah M. Lucas, Lincoln supporters living in Washington, DC, urged Lincoln to come to the nation’s\n                  capital to personally lobby for the position.  On June 9, ButterfieldwroteLincoln suggesting that neither go to Washington.  Lincoln did not respond to this\n                  suggestion, and on June 10, both set out for the capital.  Lincoln arrived on or before\n                  June 19. Ultimately, neither Morrison, Edwards, nor Lincoln received the appointment;\n                  the job went to Butterfield instead.
