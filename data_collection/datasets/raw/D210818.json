At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Hancock, Henderson, and Schuyler Counties constituted the Eleventh Illinois Senate\n                  District. Henderson County was in the northern portion of the Illinois that was considered\n                  safely Republican in 1858, but Hancock and Schuyler counties to the south were located\n                  in what had formerly been the “Whig belt” of the state. TheRepublicansof this district ultimately nominatedJohn C. Bagbyas their candidate for the Illinois Senate in 1858, not James Stark. Bagby ran against\n                  DouglasDemocratJohn P. RichmondandBuchananDemocratWilliam C. Wagley. Richmond won the seat with 4,578 votes total, Bagby came in second place with 4,112\n                  votes, and Wagley finished third with 207 votes. Richmond voted for Douglas in the\n                  election for U.S. Senate.Allen C.
