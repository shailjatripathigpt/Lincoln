Buckmasterfrom Madison County beat Gillespie by 184 votes in the Senate race. The men elected\n                  to the House in Madison County—Zephaniah B. Job(over Republican Isaac Cox) andJoseph H. Sloss(over RepublicanCurtis Blakeman) — both voted for Stephen A. Douglas for U.S. Senate in the1858 Federal Election, as did Buckmaster.  Lincoln would lose the election to Douglas.Tyler Anbinder,Nativism & Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings & the Politics of the 1850s(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), 246-78; Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard,\n                     “Stephen A.
