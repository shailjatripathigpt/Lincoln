        "text": "3Isaac Gibson references lawsuits Abraham Lincoln   planned to bring against Barret\n                  and Klein on behalf of the directors of the  Alton and Sangamon Railroad Company,\n                  which had retainedLincoln & Herndonto collect balances due on shares of capital stock purchased by stockholders.TheIllinois General Assemblychartered the railroad in February 1847 to construct and operate a railroad between\n                  Alton, Illinois, viaNew Berlin, and Springfield, Illinois.  Section two  of the company’s charter allowed the incorporators\n                  to issue $500,000 in stock at $100 per share, and section six required subscribers\n                  to purchase stock by paying $5 on each share subscribed at the time of subscribing\n                  and the balance in installments called for by a board of directors. The incorporators\n                  opened subscription for stock in May 1847.  Many stock subscribers owned property\n                  near the proposed route. On January 29, 1851, however, the General Assembly altered\n                  the charter to allow the company to construct the road on a more direct route, bypassing\n                  the property of several stockholders.  Believing that the change in route voided their\n                  subscription agreements, several investors refused to pay their remaining installments,\n                  and the company  hired Lincoln & Herndon to collect the full subscriptions.  Barret,\n                  Klein, and several of the delinquent subscribers were fromSangamon County, Illinois, and thirty-seven were fromMadison County, Illinois.Lincoln originally planned to also bring suit againstThomas J.  Kirkpatrickand Burkhardt, but Kirkpatrick and Burkhardt paid their installments, and the railroad\n                  dismissed its cases against them.  Lincoln continued to work on the Barret and Klein\n                  lawsuits.Lincoln hoped to depose Gibson in the Barret and Klein lawsuits. In hisletterof February 26, Lincoln wrote Gibson, the secretary of the railroad, requesting that\n                  he bring the books of the corporation and appear before theSangamon County Circuit Courtat the opening of its spring session on March 17.  Gibson responded to Lincoln’s\n                  missive with this letter and atelegramof the same day. Gibson gave his deposition in August 1851 inNew York City.\"An Act to Construct a Railroad from Alton, in Madison County, to Springfield, in\n                     Sangamon County,\" 27 February 1847,Private and Special Laws of Illinois(1847), 144-49;Alton & Sangamon Railroad Stock Subscription Book; Stock Subscription Book, Document ID: 4967; Notice to Take Deposition, Document\n                     ID: 4791, 4914; Deposition, Document ID: 93976,Alton & Sangamon RR v.
