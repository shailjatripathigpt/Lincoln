        "text": "1This debate was onHouse Bill 233, one of several bills in this session designed to modify or abolish theIllinois Internal Improvement  System.  In November 1839, GovernorThomas Carlinhad called theGeneral Assemblyinto special session to modify the system in light of the state’s fiscal crisis brought\n                  on by thePanic of 1837.Isaac P. Walkerof the Committee on Salines, to which theHouse of Representativesreferred a petition, introducedHB 233in the House on January 27, 1840.  Representatives offered amendments, and the House\n                  referred the bill and proposed amendments to a select committee composed of one representative\n                  from each of the nine judicial circuits in Illinois.  The select committee reported\n                  back the bill on January 30 with a substitute. Representatives offered amendments,\n                  and the House refused to table the substitute and proposed amendments by a vote of\n                  38 yeas to 43 nays, with Abraham Lincoln voting nay. The House struck out the words\n                  “upon one railroad only” in the first section by a vote of 41 yeas to 41 nays, with\n                  Lincoln voting nay, but refused to insert in lieu thereof the words “Central Railroad,\n                  from the city ofCairoto theIllinois River,” by a vote of 40 yeas to 43 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.      The House agreed\n                  to strike out most of the select committee’s amendments by a vote of 44 yeas to 37\n                  nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House adopted an amendment repealing thelawof February 27, 1837 creating the system of internal improvements by a vote of 44\n                  yeas to 39 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House then concurred with the select\n                  committee’s amendments as amended by a vote of 43 yeas to 39 nays, with Lincoln voting\n                  nay. The House refused to table the bill, passing it as substituted by a vote of 48\n                  yeas to 33 nays, with Lincoln voting nay.  The House amended the title so as to read\n                  \"A Bill to Repeal 'An Act to Establish and Maintain a General System of Internal Improvements,'\n                  and Other Laws Amendatory to the Same.\" On January 31, theSenateindefinitely postponed consideration by a vote of 19 yeas to 18 nays.Illinois HouseJournal. 1839. 11th G.
