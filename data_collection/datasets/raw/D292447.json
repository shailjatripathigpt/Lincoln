        "text": "3Marshall is discussing theRepublican Party’s efforts to rally support for its candidates in the1856 Federal Election, including John C. Fremont, whom the Republican Party nominated in June as its candidate\n                  for president. Lincoln began canvassing throughoutIllinoison behalf of the party in July. He spoke inGalena, Illinoison July 23 and inOregon, Illinoison July 25. He did not speak in Charleston, Illinois until August 8.Politicians and party managers often scheduled political meetings to coincide with\n                  circuses, fairs, and other local festivities to ensure a large audience.  During the1854 Federal Election, for instance, Stephen A. Douglas gave a defense of theKansas-Nebraska ActinSpringfieldon October 3, 1854, and Lincoln answered him on October 4.  Douglas and Lincoln were\n                  originally scheduled to speak at the state fair, which occurred at the same time that\n                  E. F. & J. Mabie’s Circus and Menagerie had scheduled performances in Springfield.\n                  Inclement weather forced them to abandon plans to speak at the fair.MarshallwroteLincoln at least one more letter related to the 1856 election after this letter.Ultimately, in the election of 1856,James Buchananwon the presidency. In Illinois, Buchanan won 44.1 percent of the vote to Fremont’s\n                  40.2 percent andMillard Fillmore’s 15.7 percent. The voters of Coles County, Illinois awarded 42.7 percent of their\n                  votes to Buchanan, 28.4 percent to Fremont, and 28.9 percent to Fillmore.Richard E.
