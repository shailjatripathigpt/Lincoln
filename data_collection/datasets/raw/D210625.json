He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. A November\n                  14letterfrom Washburne reveals that Lincoln likely wrote him such a letter on November 10,\n                  although it has not been located.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate.
