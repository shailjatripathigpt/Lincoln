The twenty-five senate districts\n                  were divided roughly in two, with elections occurring biennially, and half of Illinois’s\n                  state senators on the ballot at a given election, and half holding over until the\n                  next election two years later.In preparing for the election of 1858, Lincoln compiled strategy notes based on the Illinois county-level results of the1856 presidential and state treasurer electionsand analyzed the likely outcome of Illinois House of Representatives and Senate races\n                  by district, taking into account which senate districts held over.
