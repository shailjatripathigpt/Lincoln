        "text": "3In American law, a residuum is an amount that remains after any process of deductions,\n                  such as the subtraction of debts or other pecuniary obligations. An emolument is the\n                  payment someone receives from an office or employment, and includes salary as well\n                  as other fees.As the marshal of  theUnited States District Court, Southern District of Illinois—a federal court—Dickson was entitled to salary and certain fees, as stipulated by\n                  theU.S. Congressin “An Act to Regulate the Fees and Costs to be Allowed Clerks, Marshals, and Attorneys\n                  of the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, and for Other Purposes.”\n                  Per the act, in addition to being entitled to salary and specific fees related to\n                  the performance of standard duties such as traveling for court or serving process\n                  papers, Dickson was entitled to 2.5 percent in fees for the sale of any vessels or\n                  other property related to navigation and shipping valued under $500, and to 1.25 percent\n                  in fees for the sale of the same if valued above $500. In cases where debts or claims\n                  of property related to navigation and shipping were settled without the sale of the\n                  property, the marshal was entitled to a commission of 1 percent for the first $500\n                  of the claim and 0.5 percent on any claim over $500. Per the act, federal marshals\n                  were also required to report, twice per year and in detail, the fees and emoluments\n                  they received. These fees and emoluments were not permitted to exceed $6,000 for any\n                  given year.Henry Campbell Black,Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th ed. (St. Paul, MN: West, 1979), 470, 1177; “An Act to Regulate the Fees and\n                     Costs to be Allowed Clerks, Marshals, and Attorneys of the Circuit and District Courts\n                     of the United States, and for Other Purposes,” 26 February 1853,Statutes at Large of the United States10 (1855): 164-66."

        "text": "6Lincoln is discussing the roles Dickson, Page, Bacon, and Parsons played in relation\n                  to the case,Eads & Nelson v. Ohio & Mississippi RR. In the case, theOhio & Mississippi Railroadcontracted with the firm Eads & Nelson in 1852 to use a flatboat to transport sixty\n                  of the railroad’s cars fromLouisville, Kentuckyto St. Louis, Missouri. During the transport operation, waves from a passing steamship\n                  on theOhio Riversank the flatboat. Through an insurance contract, Eads & Nelson were able to salvage\n                  fifty-two of the cars from the riverbed. At the request of one of the railroad’s agents,\n                  the salvaged cars were placed upon the railroad’s own boats, taken to St. Louis, and\n                  placed on the opposite side of theMississippi River, inIllinois. The Ohio & Mississippi Railroad paid Eads & Nelson $1,000 as freight for the fifty-two\n                  cars, but the parties never agreed on compensation for salvage. In 1853, Eads & Nelson\n                  brought a libel salvage suit against the railroad in the United States District Court\n                  for the District of Missouri. In 1855, the court ruled for Eads & Nelson and directed\n                  the railroad to pay the firm $3,027.85. Eads & Nelson subsequently realized that the\n                  federal court inMissouricould not execute the judgement because the salvaged cars were in Illinois. In 1855,\n                  Eads & Nelson filed another libel for salvage suit against the railroad in the United\n                  States District Court, Southern District of Illinois. The railroad retained Lincoln\n                  as well as George and Newton Strong.In October 1855, Bacon, Parsons, and others agreed to be sureties for Eads & Nelson\n                  in the case. A surety is a person who legally binds themselves to pay a penalty or\n                  assume responsibility in the event that their principal failed to perform some obligation.\n                  Bacon, Parsons, and others agreed to bind themselves to Eads & Nelson in the sum of\n                  $7,000. Bacon, Parsons, and the other sureties also  agreed that if the Ohio & Mississippi\n                  Railroad lost the case and forty-three of the railroad cars—which were in the custody\n                  of Marshal Dickson—were deemed forfeited by the railroad, they would pay the court\n                  costs plus $35,000, the latter of which was an amount based upon the value of the\n                  cars. As Lincoln discusses in this May 31, 1856, letter to Page and Bacon, Dickson\n                  eventually ascertained that he could not legally make compromises with regard to his\n                  fees or commissions based upon the value of the property, but rather had to rely upon\n                  the amount the property sold for in the event that the railroad lost the case.Lincoln and the Strongs argued that the federal court in Illinois did not have jurisdiction\n                  because the federal court in Missouri had already tried the case and ruled for Eads\n                  & Nelson. When this argument failed, Lincoln  and the Strongs argued that Eads & Nelson\n                  were not entitled to compensation because they had not salvaged the other eight cars.\n                  In July 1856, JudgeSamuel H. Treatof the United States District Court, Southern District of Illinois ruled that Eads\n                  & Nelson had a valid lien against the cars, awarded them $3,480.72 plus more than\n                  $500 in costs, and ordered Marshal Dickson to sell the cars to satisfy the judgment.\n                  In January 1857, Lincoln and the Strongs appealed the ruling on behalf of the railroad,\n                  but the parties apparently reached an agreement, as Judge Treat dismissed the appeal\n                  in February 1858.In 1857, Lincoln wrote at least one more letter related to this case.“Surety,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
