At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. He and Douglas both focused their campaign\n                  efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Douglas spoke in Beardstown on August 11 and Lincoln accepted this invitation to appear\n                  in the town, ultimately speaking in Beardstown on August 12.

        "text": "3No response to this letter from Lincoln has been located, but in a furtherletteron the subject, Tracy acknowledged having received a letter from Lincoln dated July\n                  30, 1858, in which Lincoln apparently proposed to speak in Beardstown on August 12.\n                  Around the time that Lincoln penned that response to Tracy, he also wrote  letters\n                  to several other correspondents declining to speak in the same location as Douglas\n                  on the same date, using as his excuse that Douglas found such a practice to be an\n                  intrusion. As Douglas’ intention to speak in Beardstown on August 11 was published\n                  in the newspaper by the date of Lincoln’s missing letter of July 30, Lincoln may have\n                  used the same reasoning in that letter to Tracy to suggest that he speak on August\n                  12 instead.Abraham Lincoln to Jediah F.
