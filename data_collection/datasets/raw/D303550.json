        "text": "2Harrison was theWhigcandidate challenging the incumbent Martin Van Buren in the1840 presidential election.    Southern Democrats accused Harrison, a Virginian born into a slave-holding family,\n                  of being an abolitionist based in part on his support among Northern Whigs, whom they\n                  argued were dominated by abolitionists, and in part on his membership half a century\n                  earlier in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery organization.  Harrison actually\n                  had a mixed record regarding slavery.  He owned slaves himself--though not while as\n                  president.  While governor of theIndiana Territory, he worked to suspend theNorthwest Ordinance’s prohibition against slavery.  While a member ofCongressfromOhio, he stated that he was opposed to slavery, but in debates over the extension of slavery\n                  to the new states or territories, he sided with pro-slavery Southerners and voted\n                  for extension.  In his public speeches during the 1840 campaign, he was purposely\n                  ambiguous regarding slavery in the Southern states, expansion of slavery into new\n                  states and territories,  and anti-slavery andabolitionism.Daniel Walker Howe,What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848(New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 137; Michael F.
