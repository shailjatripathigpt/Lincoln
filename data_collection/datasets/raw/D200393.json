        "text": "2The enclosure is no longer extant, but it was likely a copy of William Knox’s poem\n                  “Mortality.” In a subsequentletterto Andrew Johnston, Lincoln answers Johnston’s query as to the piece’s author by\n                  saying he had read it previously and committed it to memory, and considered it one\n                  of his favorite pieces, but could not recall the author. Following Lincoln’s death\n                  in 1865, acquaintance Lawrence Weldon related that a similar situation occurred in\n                  1860, wherein Lincoln quoted the poem, and upon being asked about its authorship,\n                  Lincoln responded that he did not remember the author but considered the piece to\n                  be  “as much like true poetry as any thing he had ever heard.”Abraham Lincoln to Andrew Johnston; Douglas L. Wilson and Rodney O. Davis, eds.,Herndon’s Informants: Letters, Interviews, and Statements about Abraham Lincoln(Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1998), 89."
