        "text": "6In November 1839, GovernorThomas Carlincalled thelegislatureinto special session to modify theinternal improvement systemand deal with the state’s debt crisis brought on by thePanic of 1837. In December 1839, the state’s debt crisis forced theState Bankto suspend specie payments.   Under provisions of theincorporation actand anact supplementarythereto, if the bank did not resume specie payments within sixty days after suspension,\n                  it would lose its  charter.  In hismessageto the General Assembly, Carlin insisted that the”general disapprobation of the people\n                  to the extent of the system,” and “the  vast amount which has been and is daily expending\n                  upon costly, and at present, unnecessary work,” required modification of the internal\n                  improvement system.  He also attacked the bank and demanded an investigation of its\n                  affairs. Despite Carlin’s hostility, the legislature passed anacton January 31, 1840, resuscitating the bank with, as Lincoln described in an earlierletterto Stuart, “some trifling modifications.” The act revived the bank’s charter and\n                  suspending stipulations on specie payments until the end of the next legislative session.\n                  The legislature also passed anactsustaining support for theIllinois and Michigan Canal.The legislature was divided on the future of the internal improvement system.  After\n                  over a month of proposals and counter-proposals, in late January 1840, both houses\n                  passed abillrepealing theactcreating the internal improvement system, but the bill did not become law due to\n                  a technicality.  In the meantime, the legislature passed anactsettling the debts and liabilities of the system in preparation for its eventual\n                  termination, and anactabolishing the two governing boards, the Board of Fund Commissioners and the Board\n                  of Commissioners of Public Works.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:147;  John H.
