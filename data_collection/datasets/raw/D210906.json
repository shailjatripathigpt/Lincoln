Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. Both candidates campaigned extensively in the autumn of 1858. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  Henry County in northwestern Illinois was considered to be safely Republican at this\n                  time.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 31 August 1858, 2:7; Allen C.
