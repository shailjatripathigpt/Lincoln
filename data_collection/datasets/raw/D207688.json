        "text": "2The agreement that Lincoln enclosed here was related to the case ofPowell v. Ament & Beer, which involved a dispute over the ownership of land in Adams County, Illinois. The\n                  case commenced in theU.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinoisin January 1858, with Lincoln representing the plaintiff and Jackson Grimshaw as\n                  an attorney for the defendants.At issue in the case was title to property which had originally been military bounty\n                  land patented byJabez Morseand whichJeremiah Evartsclaimed to have purchased from Morse, apparently through land agentsMoore, Morton & Company. Lincoln’s client claimed ownership originating in Evarts’ supposed title to the\n                  property, and the defendants traced their title through transactions that originated\n                  with Morse’s heirs. The agreement in the case that Lincoln enclosed here has not been\n                  located, but Grimshaw summarized what stipulations relative to the above facts of the case had been agreed upon by\n                  both sides in a letter he wrote to Lincoln on behalf of the firm ofWilliams, Grimshaw & Williamslater in the course of the lawsuit. The agreement was apparently never filed in the\n                  case. Lincoln’s involvement in the case ended about 1860. After three trials, the\n                  case was ultimately decided in 1863 in favor of the plaintiff.Powell v. Ament & Beer, Martha L.

Among the property that Evarts disposed\n                  of in his will were nineteen quarter sections of military bounty land in the state\n                  ofIllinois, which he directed his executors to sell at their discretion for the benefit of his\n                  family. These sections of land apparently included the parcel that was contested inPowell v. Ament & Beer. Evarts’ will was recorded in Boston in 1831 and in Adams County in 1847.
