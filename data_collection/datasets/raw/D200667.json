        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote the entries in this document, with the exception of  the script\n                  in pencil that is shown at the bottom of the third and fourth images, which are in\n                  his stepbrother John D. Johnston’s hand.Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, estimated that Lincoln created this record sometime in 1851 after his father’s death,\n                  using two blank sheets of paper torn from the family bible that Thomas Lincoln had\n                  owned. However, since Basler states that the sheets had tattered edges and torn off\n                  portions, and he does not list all the entries included in this document, he most\n                  likely examined a different, less complete version of this document for his transcription\n                  and annotations. Based upon subsequent historical research, which indicates that Abraham\n                  Lincoln probably created this record when he visited his stepmother,Sarah Lincoln, inCharleston, Illinoissometime between May 17 and 18, 1851, the editors date this record as May 17 or 18,\n                  1851. Sometime afterward, Johnston added the script in pencil shown in images three\n                  and four.Another genealogical record related to the Lincoln family is thought to have been\n                  created the same year as this document.Roy P.

Although Basler examined a less complete\n                  version of this record than that presented in the four images here, he recovered this\n                  information by comparing the document he examined to a contemporary copy of it that\n                  had been made and owned by John D.
