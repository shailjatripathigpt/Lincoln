When preparing his biography, Lincoln’s\n                  secretaries John Nicolay and John Hay assigned a date of January 3, 1842, and Roy\n                  P. Basler followed suit in theThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln. In 1866, Speed toldWilliam H. Herndonthat, having returned with Lincoln fromKentuckytoSpringfieldin September 1841, Speed remained until January 1, 1842, before going back to Kentucky.\n                  Lincoln wrote this letter prior to Speed’s departure and presumably handed it to him\n                  before he left.Roy P.

        "text": "2Sometime in 1840, Lincoln began courtingMary Todd, and the two broke up subsequently. Historians, and indeed onlookers at the time,\n                  have disagreed about the underlying cause, but suffice it to say that the breakup\n                  pushed Lincoln into a deep depression. Compounding this, in April, his close friend\n                  Joshua Speed returned  home toLouisville, Kentucky, where he soon began courtingFanny Henning, who he married on February 15, 1842. Sometime in 1842, Lincoln and Mary Todd renewed\n                  their courtship. From January 1842 until his own marriage in November 1842, Lincoln\n                  exchanged many letters with Speed mutually consoling and  reassuring each other on\n                  the matter of their respective  romances.Abraham Lincoln to Joshua F.
