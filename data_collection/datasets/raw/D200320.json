Speed apparently retained Logan & Lincoln to collect the debt\n                  and left the promissory note in their custody. During this time, following thePanic of 1837, hard currency was scarce; Browne likely wanted to pay in State of Illinois auditor’s\n                  warrants because he could not put together the necessary hard currency to pay the\n                  debt. In 1844, Logan & Lincoln  forwarded to Speed auditor’s warrants from Browne\n                  totaling $318. In 1848, Speed requested that Logan & Lincoln pay the remaining $86\n                  or turn over to him the promissory note. Lincoln asserted that neither he nor Logan\n                  had the promissory note, and that Browne should be made to pay the remaining debt.Speed asked Lincoln & Herndon to collect debt, Martha L.
