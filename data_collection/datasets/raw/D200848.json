        "text": "4By the 1850s, temperance advocates in the United States had moved from campaigns to\n                  reduce the consumption of alcohol to the prohibition of alcohol by statute.  In 1845,\n                  theNew York State Legislatureenacted a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol, but it was repealed in 1847.  In 1846,\n                  the Maine Legislature prohibited the retail sale of intoxicating beverages in less\n                  than twenty-eight gallon lots, and in 1851, it followed with a law prohibiting the\n                  manufacture and sale of intoxicants in the state.  Other states inNew Englandand the Midwest enacted similar prohibitions.  In April 1851, theIllinois General Assemblypassed its own prohibitory law, prohibiting the retail sale of intoxicating drinks\n                  in quantities less than one quart unless by druggists and physicians, forbidding consumption\n                  where purchased, and banning the sale to anyone under the age of eighteen.    This\n                  law proved unpopular and unenforceable, and the General Assembly repealed it in February\n                  1853.  In the state elections of 1854,anti-Nebraskacandidates, many running on fusion tickets endorsed by temperance advocates, won\n                  a majority, rising hopes for total prohibition.  In February 1855, anti-Nebraska and\n                  temperance legislators pushed through a law for the suppression of intemperance--a\n                  law one historian has claimed was Lincoln’s handiwork, though there is scant  evidence\n                  for this contention.  The act provided for a popular referendum on prohibition to\n                  be conducted at a special election on the first Monday in June.  Voters in the special\n                  election rejected the prohibition law.“An Act to Prohibit the Retailing of Intoxicating Drinks,” 18 April 1851,General Laws of Illinois(1851),      18-19; “An Act to Repeal an Act Entitled ‘An Act to Prohibit the Retailing\n                     of Intoxicating Drinks,’ Approved February 1st 1851,” 7 February 1853,General Laws of Illinois(1853),      127; “An Act for the Suppression of Intemperance, and to Amend Chapter\n                     30 of the Revised Statutes,” 12 February 1855,Laws of Illinois(1855), 1-30; Arthur Charles Cole,The Era of the Civil War 1848-1870, vol. 3 ofThe Centennial History of Illinois(Springfield, IL: Illinois Centennial Commission, 1919), 209-10; Ronald G.
