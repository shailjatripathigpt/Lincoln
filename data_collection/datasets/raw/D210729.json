On January 7, 1858, in a speech he gave in theU.S. House of Representatives, Thayer argued that the U.S. should “Americanize” Central America via “organized\n                  emigration.” One week later, Blair delivered an address in the U.S. House advocating\n                  for the U.S. to acquire territory in either Central or South America and colonize\n                  it with free African Americans and emancipated enslaved persons.Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1996(Alexandria, VA: CQ Staff Directories, 1997), 669, 1933;Cong.

        "text": "3If Lincoln replied to this letter, his response has not been located.Lincoln’s personal views on colonization evolved over time. For a while, he endorsedHenry Clay’s view that immediateabolitionwas impractical, gradual emancipation preferred, and that voluntary transportation\n                  of free  African Americans toAfricaprovided a reasonable solution. From 1854 to late-1862, Lincoln occasionally supported\n                  schemes to relocate free African Americans to Liberia or other locations as a starting point for colonization efforts. He hoped that Southern\n                  whites would, over time, grow more willing to emancipate enslaved persons once they\n                  saw that they would not remain within the U.S. He also hoped that more Northerners\n                  would support emancipation when they saw that the emancipated would not remain in\n                  the country to compete with white laborers. And he  hoped that colonization could\n                  demonstrate that Black persons were capable of governing themselves and being self-sufficient.Colonization was controversial among Republicans, and, despite some parallels between\n                  Kitchell's and Lincoln’s views on the subject, none of the resolutions nor the formal\n                  declaration of principles adopted by delegates to the 1858 Illinois Republican Convention\n                  made reference to  colonization.  The delegates also did not pass any resolutions\n                  related to scientific education in the state.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 165-67; James Oakes,The Crooked Path to Abolition: Abraham Lincoln and the Antislavery Constitution(New York: W. W. Norton, 2021), 128-29;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:2-5."
