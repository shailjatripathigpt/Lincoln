Y.Scammon, proceeded to open the Banquet.2He said it was fit that thefriends of freedomshould meet and congratulate each other.  The flag of Freedom floats on the State\n               Capitol, and every man elected to the State Department.  (Loud cheers.)  Those principles\n               which we nailed upon our banners are triumphant in ourState, and although we did not elect the President of the United States, he joined withWhittierin waiting forFremontand1860.3(Cheers.) ThePresidentthen read the first regular toast: 1st.  THE UNION— The North will maintain it— the South will not depart therefrom. Hon.Abram LincolnofSpringfield, amid most deafening cheers, arose to reply to this toast.He said he could most heartily indorse the sentiment expressed in the toast.  During the whole canvass we had been assailed\n                  as the enemies of the Union,4and he often had occasion to repudiate the sentiments attributed to us.  He said\n                  that theRepublican partywas the friend of the Union.5(Cheers.)It was the friends of the Union now; and if it had been entirely snccessful, it would have been the friend of the Union more than ever.(Loud and long continued cheers.)He maintained that the Liberty for which we contended could best be obtained by a\n                  firm, a steady adherence to the Union.  AsWebstersaid, “Not Union without liberty, nor liberty without Union; but Union and liberty, now and\n                     forever, one and inseparable.”6(Loud cheers.)  Thespeakersaidwe had selected and elected a Republican State ticket. We have done what we supposed\n                  to be our duty.  It is now the duty of those elected to give us a good Republican\n                  Administration.  In regard to the Governor-elect,Col. Bissell,—(Loud and long-continued cheers and waving of handkerchiefs)—he referred to theopposite partysaying that “he couldn’t take the oath.”7Well, they said “he couldn’t be elected,” and as they were mistaken once, he thought\n                  they were not unlikely to be mistaken again. “Theywouldn’t take such an oath!” Oh, no!(Laughter.)“They would cut off their right arm first.”  He would like to know one of them who\n                  would not part with his right arm to have the privilege of taking the oath.  Their\n                  conduct reminded him of the darkey who, when a bear had put its head into the hole\n                  and shut out daylight, cried out, “What was darkening de hole?,’ “Ah,” cried the other\n                  darkey, who was holding on to the htail of the animal, “if de tail breaks you’ll find out.”(Laughter and cheers.)Those darkies at Springfield see something darkening the hole, but wait till the tail\n                  breaks on the 1st of January, and they will see.(Cheers.)The speaker referred to the anecdote of the boy who was talking to another as to whetherGen. Jacksoncould ever get to Heaven.  Said the boy, “He’d get there if he had a mind to.”(Cheers and laughter.)So was it with Colonel Bissell,— he’d do whatever he had a mind to.(Cheers.)He then referred to thePresident’s Message,8and after dissecting it in a humorous manner, he concluded by saying, “He’s a shelled peascod.”9He said that our Government was based upon public opinion, and whenever that changes,\n                  so does the Government.  “Equality of men” has been our central idea, and although\n                  we have progressed, yet we have been patient to a wonderful degree, with certain inequa[l]ities that existed.  We must change these inequalities— we must reform public opinion—\n                  we must found our principles, our central idea, in the hearts of the people, that\n                  slavery is sectional and that Freedom is national,10and we will not fail to achieve the victory.  We must drown the cry now raised of\n                  “Equality of States” by the loud cry of “All men are created free and equal.”11(Loud and long-continued cheers.)",

Hayne. Although the Webster-Hayne debate  initially centered upon proposed limits to federal\n                  land sales in the American West, it soon shifted to a more general debate about the\n                  role of the federal government and the issue of slavery. Webster’s January 27 address\n                  focused on the origin and nature of the Union, and is widely considered one of the\n                  best speeches ever delivered in theU.S. Congress. After discussing the preservation of the Union, Webster concluded his address with\n                  the declaration, “LibertyandUnion, now and forever, one and inseparable!”6Cong.

        "text": "7This is a reference to assertions that Democrats made both during the campaign of\n                  1856 and after the election that Bissell was ineligible for state office. The1848 Illinois Constitutionprohibited anyone who had participated in a duel from holding office and required\n                  all elected and appointed state officers to take an oath swearing that they had never\n                  challenged someone to a duel, accepted or fought in a duel, or served as a second\n                  in a duel. In 1850, Bissell had acceptedJefferson Davis’ challenge to a duel. Although Bissell and Davis ultimately did not duel, Democrats\n                  asserted that Bissell was ineligible for state office per the Illinois Constitution\n                  and would perjure himself if he took the anti-dueling oath. Bissell argued that it\n                  had never been legally established that he had accepted Davis’ challenge to duel and\n                  that the Illinois Constitution did not apply at any rate since he had accepted the\n                  duel in theDistrict of Columbia, not Illinois.  He was inaugurated as governor on January 12, 1857, took the required\n                  oath, and served as governor until his death.Robert P.

Chasewas known for frequently employing the expression “slavery is sectional; freedom\n                  is national,” and the expression  may have originated in his arguments in the caseJones v. Van Zandt, which came before theU.S. Supreme Courtin 1846. While representing John Van Zandt, aMethodistfarmer who had helped a group ofKentuckyrunaways, Chase argued that Van Zandt did not owe damages to Wharton Jones, the enslaver\n                  and owner of the runaways, in part because slavery was a local institution that was\n                  neither sanctioned nor supported by the federal government. Although Chase and Van\n                  Zandt ultimately lost the case, Chase’s Van Zandt brief was published as a pamphlet\n                  and his arguments regarding slavery as a local rather than national institution received\n                  wide circulation, earning him a national reputation as an opponent of slavery and\n                  defender of the U.S. Constitution.

        "text": "11Article four, sections three and four of the U.S. Constitution stipulate that all\n                  states within the Union are formed and admitted to the Union on equal terms and guaranteed\n                  the same rights to a republican form of government, protection against invasion, and\n                  protection against domestic violence. Southern Democrats in particular touted the\n                  concept of equality of states in the years leading up to the Civil War, asserting\n                  that the North sought to infringe upon the southern states’ equal rights as they related\n                  to the institution of slavery. LincolncreditedtheRichmond Enquirerwith “inventing” the phrase “state equality” and President Pierce with endorsing\n                  it, since, in his annual message to Congress on December 2, 1856, Pierce had declared\n                  that through their election of Buchanan to the presidency, the people of the United\n                  States “have asserted the Constitutional equality of each and all the States of the\n                  Union, as States.”In the verbatimreportof this speech that theDaily Illinois State Journalstated that Lincoln shared with the paper, the phrase “All men are created free and\n                  equal” does not appear. Instead, the report credits Lincoln with stating that “allmenare created equal”—the phrase that appears in the United States Declaration of Independence—and\n                  that Lincoln emphasized that equality among men was “the broader, better declaration”\n                  than equality among states.U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3-4; Robert C. Childers, “Popular Sovereignty, Slavery in the\n                     Territories, and the South, 1785-1860,” (PhD  diss., Louisiana State University, 2010),\n                     144, 319;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 5 December 1856, 2:2; Thomas Jefferson et al,  July 4,  Copy of Declaration\n                     of Independence  07-04 1776."

        "text": "Hon.Abram LincolnofSpringfield, amid most deafening cheers, arose to reply to this toast.He said he could most heartily indorse the sentiment expressed in the toast.  During the whole canvass we had been assailed\n                  as the enemies of the Union,4and he often had occasion to repudiate the sentiments attributed to us.  He said\n                  that theRepublican partywas the friend of the Union.5(Cheers.)It was the friends of the Union now; and if it had been entirely snccessful, it would have been the friend of the Union more than ever.(Loud and long continued cheers.)He maintained that the Liberty for which we contended could best be obtained by a\n                  firm, a steady adherence to the Union.  AsWebstersaid, “Not Union without liberty, nor liberty without Union; but Union and liberty, now and\n                     forever, one and inseparable.”6(Loud cheers.)  Thespeakersaidwe had selected and elected a Republican State ticket. We have done what we supposed\n                  to be our duty.  It is now the duty of those elected to give us a good Republican\n                  Administration.  In regard to the Governor-elect,Col. Bissell,—(Loud and long-continued cheers and waving of handkerchiefs)—he referred to theopposite partysaying that “he couldn’t take the oath.”7Well, they said “he couldn’t be elected,” and as they were mistaken once, he thought\n                  they were not unlikely to be mistaken again. “Theywouldn’t take such an oath!” Oh, no!(Laughter.)“They would cut off their right arm first.”  He would like to know one of them who\n                  would not part with his right arm to have the privilege of taking the oath.  Their\n                  conduct reminded him of the darkey who, when a bear had put its head into the hole\n                  and shut out daylight, cried out, “What was darkening de hole?,’ “Ah,” cried the other\n                  darkey, who was holding on to the htail of the animal, “if de tail breaks you’ll find out.”(Laughter and cheers.)Those darkies at Springfield see something darkening the hole, but wait till the tail\n                  breaks on the 1st of January, and they will see.(Cheers.)The speaker referred to the anecdote of the boy who was talking to another as to whetherGen. Jacksoncould ever get to Heaven.  Said the boy, “He’d get there if he had a mind to.”(Cheers and laughter.)So was it with Colonel Bissell,— he’d do whatever he had a mind to.(Cheers.)He then referred to thePresident’s Message,8and after dissecting it in a humorous manner, he concluded by saying, “He’s a shelled peascod.”9He said that our Government was based upon public opinion, and whenever that changes,\n                  so does the Government.  “Equality of men” has been our central idea, and although\n                  we have progressed, yet we have been patient to a wonderful degree, with certain inequa[l]ities that existed.  We must change these inequalities— we must reform public opinion—\n                  we must found our principles, our central idea, in the hearts of the people, that\n                  slavery is sectional and that Freedom is national,10and we will not fail to achieve the victory.  We must drown the cry now raised of\n                  “Equality of States” by the loud cry of “All men are created free and equal.”11(Loud and long-continued cheers.)"
