        "text": "2Lincoln and Elihu B. Washburne had exchanged several letters on the subject of Washburne’s\n                  letter to Charles L. Wilson of April 12, 1858, which Lincoln enclosed here. In aletterof April 19, 1858 to Lincoln,John Wentworthhad conveyed a report that one of the Republican members of theU.S. CongressfromIllinoishad written a letter encouraging Illinois Republicans to support Stephen A. Douglas’\n                  bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein theelection of 1858. This rumor circulated among Illinois Republicans, including at a meeting of party\n                  leaders in Springfield on April 21 at which Lincoln was present. LincolnwroteWashburne regarding the rumor on April 26, assuring Washburne that although suspicion\n                  centered on him, Lincoln was confident the matter was a misunderstanding. Washburnerespondedon May 2, denying the rumor, thenwroteagain on May 6, enclosing the letter in controversy for Lincoln to peruse himself.\n                  In his May 22, 1858letterto Lincoln to which this is a response, Washburne requested the return of his letter\n                  to Wilson, anticipating that he might have further need of it to prove his innocence\n                  in the face of continuing rumors.The manuscript original of Washburne’s April 12, 1858 letter to Wilson has not been\n                  located, but it was subsequently published in thePolo Advertiserin 1860. In this letter, Washburne discussed his confusion over the current state\n                  of politics in Illinois in light of the rift in theDemocratic Partybetween supporters of Douglas and supporters of PresidentJames Buchanan, which was caused by Douglas’ criticism of theLecompton Constitutionand of the president’s support of it. Washburne stated that despite his dislike of\n                  Douglas, he would welcome him as an ally to the Republican Party, but expressed concern\n                  over whether there was a movement to create a Douglas party in Illinois and an attempt\n                  to reelect Douglas. Republicans should not abandon their platform, wrote Washburne,\n                  and their candidate for U.S. Senate in the election of 1858 must be Lincoln.Russell K. Nelson, “The Early Life and Congressional Career of Elihu B. Washburne”\n                     (PhD dissertation, University of North Dakota, August 1953), 159-62;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 21 April 1858,https://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-04-21; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:445-50."

        "text": "3On April 30, 1858 the U.S. Congress passed the so-called English bill.  This was a\n                  bill proposed byIndianaCongressmanWilliam H. Englishand others to send the Lecompton Constitution back to theKansas Territoryfor a vote, avoiding a direct resubmission of the constitution to the people of Kansas\n                  by attaching it to an adjusted land grant. Douglas voted against the English bill,\n                  but moved on from opposition to this administration measure once  it was settled.\n                  Despite calls by administration supporters to remove Douglas allies from office, Buchanan\n                  was slow to do so, and in fact appointed some Douglas Democrats as well. Thus in May\n                  of 1858, hostilities between the two men seemed to have cooled and a reconciliation\n                  between Douglas and Buchanan was rumored.David M. Potter and Don E. Fehrenbacher,The Impending Crisis, 1848-1861(New York: Harper & Row, 1976), 322-25; Robert W. Johannsen,Stephen A. Douglas(Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1997), 624-25."

        "text": "4Lincoln likely meant the state convention of Buchanan Democrats that was scheduled\n                  for June 9, 1858 in Springfield. The two factions of the Democratic Party in Illinois\n                  had  held separate conventions on April 21, 1858 at the Illinois State House, with\n                  Douglas supporters in the hall of theIllinois House of Representatives, and the Buchanan supporters in theSenateChamber. Neither faction seemed to be in a position of strength after the conventions\n                  and the level of hostility suggested compromise was unlikely. The Buchanan Democrats,\n                  who  were fewer in number, resolved at their April convention to organize separately\n                  from the Douglas Democrats, and called for another convention in June, at which they\n                  would nominate candidates and agree on a platform.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 22 April 1858, 2:1-5; 10 June 1858, 2:2-5;Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 23 April 1858, 2:1-4."
