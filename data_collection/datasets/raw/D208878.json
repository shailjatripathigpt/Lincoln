        "text": "2Federal law policy regarding school land rested on provisions of theLand Ordinance of 1785, which reserved the sixteenth section of each full thirty-six-section township to\n                  support public schools within the township.  The Land Ordinance of 1785 did not address\n                  the issue of fractional townships with no sixteenth sections or partial sixteenth\n                  sections, so various state legislatures andCongressoften had to pass laws or make special provisions to allow for the sale of fractional\n                  sixteenth sections or substitute sections for public education.During the first session of the Thirtieth Congress, Richard  S. Thomas and numerous\n                  other citizens fromCass County, Illinois, had sent apetitionto Congress requesting a law allowing the county, which had townships with worthless\n                  sixteenth sections or fractional townships without sixteenth sections, to select other\n                  land in lieu thereof, and the lands to be selected to be granted by the United States\n                  to the state ofIllinoisfor the use of the inhabitants for schools.  On March 30, Abraham LincolnwroteThomas that the House of Representatives had referred the petition to the Committee\n                  on Public Lands.In his letter of March 30, Lincoln noted that the House Committee on Public Lands\n                  had decided against taking action on the petition unless it involved fractional townships\n                  that had no sixteenth section or only fractional ones, and noted the existence of\n                  an existing law covering the issue.    In anotherletterwritten on June 13, Lincoln reiterated his belief that the House andSenateCommittees on Public Lands were satisfied with existing law on the subject, and expressed\n                  his doubt that additional legislation would pass, but promised to inquire at the General\n                  Land Office on June 14 and inquire into the matter and write Thomas again.  On June\n                  15, LincolnwroteThomas as promised and sent him a copy of the 1826 law that Commissioner Young sent\n                  to Lincoln.“An Act to Appropriate Lands for the Support of Schools in Certain Townships and Fractional\n                     Townships, Not Before Provided for,” 20 May 1826,Statutes at Large of the United States4 (1846):179;An Act Providing for the Sale of the Fractional Sixteenth Section, in Township Six\n                        North, Range Twelve West, and Such other Lands as Have Been Selected in Lieu of the\n                        Sixteenth Section in the Fractional Townships, on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers,\n                        in Green County;An Act Granting a Half Section of Land for the Use of Schools within Fractional Township\n                        19, South of Range 18 West, County of Lowndes, State of Mississippi."
