The item that Lincoln is referencing was\n                  a letter that appeared in the June 4, 1858, edition of theChicago Tribune, under Charles H. Ray’s editorship. Under the headline “Opposition to Lovejoy” and\n                  dated June 1 fromBloomington,  “Fair Play” accused Judge David Davis of leading a movement to defeat the renomination\n                  of Owen Lovejoy to represent the Third Illinois Congressional District  in theU.S. House of Representatives. The author wrote, “Judge D. is a very fair man in his way, but has no more sympathy\n                  with the vitalizing principle of the Republican party  than an Egyptian mummy.” “Fair\n                  Play” also accused Davis of aspiring toward the seat occupied by Lovejoy.Chicago Daily Tribune(IL), 4 June 1858, 2:3; Howard W.

Some of Lincoln’s\n                  friends—including Davis,T. Lyle Dickey,Ward H. Lamon, and Swett—supported this scheme, believing that Lincoln, who was the leading Republican\n                  candidate to unseatStephen A. Douglasas U.S. senator in the upcoming1858 Federal Election, could only succeed if Lovejoy was not re-nominated. Once hope of preventing Lovejoy's\n                  renomination vanished, Lamon and others pondered finding a independent candidate to\n                  challenge Lovejoy.  Lamon sought Lincoln's opinion, but the latter urged against it,\n                  arguing the fissure of the Republican Party into Lovejoy and anti-Lovejoy factions\n                  would likely result in aDemocraticvictory and hurt his chance of being elected to theU.S. Senate.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:456; Willard L.
