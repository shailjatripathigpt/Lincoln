        "text": "2This is a reference to Lincoln recommending Simeon Francis for appointment as secretary\n                  of the Oregon Territory. PresidentZachary TaylorhadappointedLincoln secretary of the Oregon Territory August 9, 1849, less than a month after\n                  he appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront to Whigs inIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both President Taylor and Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln the position of  secretary of\n                  the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and prevent additional\n                  attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. But in aletterto Clayton dated August 21, 1849, Lincoln declined the appointment for secretary\n                  of the Oregon Territory  and recommended Francis for the position instead. Although\n                  other Whigs in Illinois urged Lincoln to recommendHart Fellowsfor the position, Lincoln declined to do so and reiterated his endorsement of Francis\n                  for the appointment in two other letters to Clayton in late September 1849. Lincoln\n                  did, however, write to Clayton and endorse Fellows as “worthy” of either a judgeship\n                  or appointment as secretary of the Oregon Territory, while stipulating that Francis\n                  was his personal choice for the latter.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Orville H. Browning and Others to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to William A. Minshall;Abraham Lincoln to John M. Clayton;Abraham Lincoln to John M. Clayton;Abraham Lincoln to John M. Clayton."

        "text": "3In the end, Taylor appointed Edward Hamilton ofOhiosecretary of the Oregon Territory. On September 20, 1849, in a final effort to ease\n                  any tensions caused by Butterfield’s appointment, the Taylor administration also offered\n                  Lincoln appointment as governor of the Oregon Territory. After serious consideration\n                  of this offer, Lincoln also turned this position down, at least in part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Francis’ name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents\n                  of the government for 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855,  1857, or 1859, so apparently, he did\n                  not receive any other appointment during this period. The 1861 official register shows\n                  Francis worked inOregonas a printer for the U.S. government and as a paymaster for theU.S. Army. In July 1861, he also wrote Lincoln requesting appointment as commissioner of Indian Affairs. Francis did not\n                  receive this appointment, but, by 1863, he was a paymaster in Oregon.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:307;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853);Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1855(Washington, DC: A.
