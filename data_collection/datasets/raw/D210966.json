At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatein the election of 1858 would determine the outcome of the senatorial race.  Ultimately,\n                  in the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control of the Illinois General Assembly, and Douglas\n                  won reelection.

Meanwhile,\n                  Douglas’s national reputation in the Democratic Party somewhat suffered. Earlier in\n                  1858, Douglas’s criticism of PresidentJames Buchanan’s support for theLecompton Constitutioncaused a rift in the Democratic Party. During Douglas’s debates with Lincoln, the\n                  former’s  defense of popular sovereignty as a means of determining whether to allow\n                  slavery in U.S. territories further alienated Southern Democrats.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life, 1:553-57."
