        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote this fragment.On February 20, 1841, theHouse of Representativesadopted aresolutioncalling for the appointment of a select committee of seven members to report on the\n                  best means to pay interest on the state debt and for continuation of work on theIllinois and Michigan Canal.  The House appointed a select committee of nine representatives, of whichAbraham Lincolnwas a member.  On February 23 the select committee, pursuant to the resolution, issued\n                  majority and minority reports, which the House tabled.Cyrus Edwardsof the aforesaid select committee introduced HB 290, which accompanied the majority\n                  report.  The House tabled the bill and ordered 150 copies printed.  On February 24,\n                  the House took up the bill, placed it in the orders of the day, and tabled it.  On\n                  February 26, the House took up the bill, and Lincoln moved to strike out all after\n                  the enacting clause and to insert a substitute.  The House concurred with Lincoln’s\n                  substitute by a vote of 41 yeas to 32 nays, with Lincoln voting yea.  The House ordered\n                  the bill engrossed as substituted by a vote of 42 yeas to 34 nays, with Lincoln voting\n                  yea. On February 27, the House amended the nineteenth section, but rejected an amendment\n                  to strike out all after the ninth section by a vote of 35 yeas to 36 nays, with Lincoln\n                  voting nay.  The House passed the bill as amended by a vote of 37 yeas to 33 nays,\n                  with Lincoln voting yea. On February 27, theSenateindefinitely postponed further consideration by a vote of 18 yeas to 17 nays.  The\n                  Senate ceased consideration largely thanks to a spirited denunciation of the bill\n                  byWilliam J. Gatewood, who described the bill’s provisions as “monstrous.”  Gatewood compared thecanal commissionerswith the East India Company, assuring his fellow senators that passing the bill would\n                  severely hamper the liberties of the people.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G.

        "text": "2The connection of this fragment to the legislative history of the bill in the House\n                  of Representatives is uncertain.  It seems clear that it is part of Lincoln’s substitute\n                  adopted on February 26.  It could be an early draft of that substitute or the missing\n                  section nine of thebillthat the House engrossed and passed on February 27--which was an amended version\n                  of Lincoln’s substitute.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G.
