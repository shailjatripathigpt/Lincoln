    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to Allen N. Ford, 11 August 18461 I see in yourpaperof the 8th inst. a communication in relation to myself, of which it is perhaps expected of me to take\n               some notice.2 Shortly before starting on my tour through yours, and the other Northern counties\n               of the District,3I was informed by letter fromJacksonvillethat Mr.Cartwrightwas whispering the charge of infidelity against me in that quarter.—4I at once wrote a contradiction of it, and sent it to my friends there, with the\n               request that they should publish it or not, as in their discretion they might think\n               proper, having in view the extent of the circulation of the charge, as also the extent\n               of credence it might be receiving.  They did not publish it.  After my return from\n               your part of the District, I was informed that he had been putting the same charge\n               in circulation against me in some of the neighborhoods in our own, and one or two\n               of the adjoining counties.—I believe nine persons out of ten had not heard the charge\n               at all; and, in a word, its extent of circulation was just such as to make a public\n               notice of it appear uncalled for; while it was not entirely safe to leave it unnoticed.\n               After some reflection, I published the littlehand-bill, herewith enclosed, and sent it to the neighborhoods above referred to. I have little doubt now, that to make the same charge—to slyly sow the seed in select\n               spots—was the chief object of his mission through your part of the District, at a\n               time when he knew I could not contradict him, either in person or by letter before\n               the election.  And, from the election returns in yourcounty, being so different from what they are in parts where Mr. Cartwright and I are both\n               well known, I incline to the belief that he has succeeded in deceiving some honest\n               men there.5 As to Mr. Woodward, “our worthy commissioner fromHenry,” spoken of by your correspondent, I must say it is a little singular that he should\n               know so much about me, while, if I ever sawhim, or heard of him, save in the communication in your paper, I have forgotten it.6If Mr. Woodward has given such assurance of my character as your correspondent asserts,\n               I can still suppose him to be a worthy man; he may have[believedwhat he said; but there is,]7even in that charitable view of his case, one lesson in morals which he might, not\n               without profit, learn of even me—and that is, never to add the weight of his character\n               to a charge against his fellow man, withoutknowingit to be true.—I believe it is an established maxim in morals that he who makes an\n               assertion without knowing whether it is true or false, is guilty of falsehood; and\n               the accidental truth of the assertion, does not justify or excuse him.  This maxim\n               ought to be particularly held in view, when we contemplate an attack upon the reputation\n               of our neighbor.  I suspect it will turn out that Mr. Woodward got his information\n               in relation to me, from Mr. Cartwright; and I here aver, that he, Cartwright, never\n               heard me utter a word in any way indicating my opinions on religious matters, in his\n               life. It is my wish that you give this letter, together with the accompanying hand-bill,\n               a place in your paper.8",
