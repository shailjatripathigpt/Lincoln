    "full_text": "Abraham Lincoln to John J. Hardin, 7 February 18461 Your second letter was duly received and, so far as it goes, it is entirely satisfactory–2I had set apart the leisure this day affords, to write you the long letter alluded\n               to by me in my last;3but on going to thePost-office, and seeing the communication in theMorgan Journal, I am almost discouraged of the hope of doing any good by it; especially when I reflect\n               that most probably that communication was written with your knowledge,an^in^as much as it proceeds partly on information which could only have been furnished\n               by you–4 However, as I suppose it can do noharm, I will proceed– Your letter, admiting my right to seek, or desire, a nomination forcongress, opens with an expression of dissatisfaction with themannerin which you think I have endeavoured to obtain it– Now,ifIhave, sought the nomination in animpropermanner; you have the right, to the extent, to be dissatisfied– But I deny allimproprietyon my part, in the matter– In the early part of your letter, you introduced the proposition made by me to you\n               andBaker, that we should take a turn a piece; and alluding to the principle you suppose be\n               involved in it, in an after part of your letter, you say– \"As awhigI have constantly combatted such practices when practiced among theLocos; & I do not see that they are<Page 2>any more praise worthy, or less anti-republican, when sought to be adopted by whigs\"–\n               Now, if my proposition had been that we (yourself, Baker & I) should be candidates\n               by turns, and that we should unite our strength throughout to keep down all other\n               candidates, I should not deny the justice of the censurable language you employ; but\n               if you so understood it, you wholly misunderstood it– I never expressed, nor meant\n               to express, that by such an arrangement, any one of us should be, in the least restricted\n               in his right to support any person he might choose, in the District; but only that\n               he should nothimself, be a candidate out of his turn– I felt then, and it seems to me Isaidthen, that even with such an arrangement, shouldGovernor Duncanbe a candidate, when you were not, it^would^be yourprevilegeand perhaps yourdutyto go for him– In this, the true sense of my\n               proposition, I deny that there is any thing [...?] censurable in it—any thing but^a spirit of^mutual concession, for harmony's sake– In this same connection you say, \"It is, in effect, acting upon the principle that\n               the District is a horse which each candidate may mount and ride a two mile heat without\n               consulting any body but the grooms & Jockeys\"–5Well, of course, you go the contrary of this principle; which is, in effect acting\n               on the principle that the District is a horse which, the first jockey that can mount\n               him, may whip and spur round and round, till jockey, or horse, or both, fall dead\n               on the track– And upon your principle, there is a fact<Page 3>as fatal to your claims as mine, which is, that neither you nor I, butBakeris the jockey now in the stirrups– \"Without consulting any body but the grooms & Jockeys\" is an implied charge that I\n               wish, in some way to interfere with the right of the people to select their candidate—I\n               do not understand it so– I, and my few friends say to the people that \"Turn about\n               is fair play\"– You and your friends do not meet this, and say \"Turn about isnotfair play\"– but insist the argument itself, ought not to be used– Fair or unfair,\n               why not trust the people to decide it? In the early part of your letter you say, \"It is also trueas stated by^that^you did come to my house early in September to know whether I desired to run, stating\n               that you wanted to give Baker a race\"– In this you are mistaken– I did not state to\n               you that I wanted to give Baker a race; but on the contrary I told you I believed\n               I could get Baker off the track– I do not know that you attached any importance to\n               what I am disavowing; but, on the contrary, I do not know but you mean it as the basis\n               of an inference that I acted deceitfully with you, in pretending to expect a contest\n               with Baker, when in fact I did not expect it– It is true, that after Baker's interview with you in September, he did send a letter,\n               by a messenger, to me at<Page 4>Tremont;6in which letter he detailed what passed at the interview, and the result, precisely\n               as you do, in substance; and in which letter he did urge me to relinquish my my pretensions– He had before told me that he would not be a candidate, if I desired\n               he should not; and he then repeated it; but at the same time argued that you, by having\n               been in congress, and^having^taken a high stand then, would in all probability beat me; so that the sacrafice he made for me, in declining, would, in the end, do me no good– And this is as near\n               as I ever came of hearing Baker express the determination that I should beat you,\n               if he could not; which you say you have learned he did– When he finally determined\n               to decline, he did express the wish that I might succeed; and he has since written\n               his letter of declension;7and whenthatis told; all I know, or believe, as to him,istold– If he has ever, in any way, attempted to dictate to any friend of his to go for\n               me in preference of you, it is more than I know or believe– That he has a part assigned\n               him to act in the drama, I know to be untrue– What I here say, is not in its nature\n               capable of very certain proof; but it may be said, that being where he is, he can\n               only opperate against you by letters– If he attempts this to any considerable extent, some of them\n               will fall into the hands of your friends who will apprize you of<Page 5>them– Have you yet seen or heard of any? I now quote from your letter again– \"You well knew I would not be a candidate for\n               Governor. Yet during the fall courts, whilst I learn you were obtaining pledges from\n               all the whigs you could to support you for the next candidate, my name was run up\n               as a candidate for Governor by one of your friends under circumstances which now leave\n               no room for doubt that the design was to keep my name out of view for congress, so\n               that the whigs might be more easily influenced to commit themselves to go for you–\"\n               Now this is a direct imputation that Iprocured, orwinked at, or in some way directly or indirectly,hadahandin, the nominating of you for Governor; and the imputation is to the utmost hair-breadth\n               of it, unjust– I neverknew, orbelieved, or had anysuspicion, that itwasdone, orwastobedone, until it was out, had gone toAlton, and been commented upon in theAlton paper, and came back to Springfield, and my attention was called to it byStuart, in ourcircuit courtroom, a few days, as I remember it, after you had been here attending to the case\n               ofThayervsFarrell, and had left–8I went immediately to theJournaloffice, and told them it was my wish that they should not fall in with the nomination\n               for Governor– They showed me a little paragraph, which they<Page 6>had already prepared, and which was published, and seen by you, as I suppose–9 The reason I had not seen the nomination in theTazewell paperwas, as I suppose, because I did not then, as I do not now, take thatpaper– That I was whollyinnocentandignorantof that movement, I believe, if need be, I can prove more conclusively than is often\n               in the power of man to prove any such thing– In the paragraph last quoted you say that the design was to keep your name out of\n               view &c.[etc.] In the general disavowal I have made, this last is, of course included; and I now\n               go farther, and declare, that to my recollection, I have not, in a single instance,\n               presented my name as a candidate for congress, without, at the same time presenting\n               yours for the same place– I have some times met a man who would express the opinion\n               that you would yield the track to me; and some times one who believed you would be\n               a candidate for Governor; and I invariably assuredthem^such,^that you would, in my opinion, be a candidateforcongress– And while I have thus kept your nameinviewfor congress, I have not reproached you for being a candidate, or for any thing else;\n               on the contrary I have constantly spoken of you in the most kind and commendatory\n               terms, as to your talents, your<Page 7>past services, and your goodness of heart– If I falsify in this, you can convict\n               me– The witnesses live, and can tell– And now tell me: If you think so harshly of me because a paper under the control of\n               one of my friends nominatedyoufor Governor,what, orhow, ought I to think of you because of yourpaper at Jacksonvilledoing the same thing formetwice?10Why, you will say you had nothing do with it; and I shall believe^you;^but why am I to be judged less charatably? In another part of your letter you attempt to convict me of giving^a^double account as to my motive in introducing the resolution to the Convention atPekin– You say \"You then told me the object was to soothe Baker's mortified feelings, and\n               that it did not amount to a committal of any body\"– \"Now you say the object was to\n               give Baker the field for the next race, so as to keep the party together\"– I kept\n               no copy of my letter; but Iguessif you will turn to it, you will find that I have not, any where in it, said \"the\n               object was to give Baker the field for the next race &c” and then if you will allow that you may have committed as great a mistake, as to\n               what I told you at Pekin, you will find yourself a good deal short of the conviction\n               you intended. What I told^you^at Pekin I do not preciselyremberrecollect; but I am sure of some<Page 8>things I didnottell you or any one else– If you shall say that I told you it wasanobject with me, in introducing the resolution, to soothe Baker's  feelings, I shall\n               admit it; but if you shall say I told^you that,^that wasthesoleobject, I deny it– If you shall say I then told you that the passage of the resolution amounted to a\n               committal of no one, I deny that also; but if you shall say I then told you, it amounted\n               to a committal of no one, except the delegates, generally who voted for it, and me,\n               particularly, who introduced it, I shall not deny it– This much, and no more, as a committal, I always supposed it to amount to; and I guess\n               you will be able to find nothing in my late letter to you that is inconsistent with\n               this– And I here add, that I have not since entering this contest with you, or at\n               any time, sought to appropriate to myself any benefit from that resolution, ether as settling the succession to pass through me, or as settling a principle that shall\n               give the succession that direction– I have said that \"Turn about is fair play\"; but\n               this I have said just as I would, if that resolution [h?] had never been thought of– I should not hesitate to say publicly, that I claim nothing,\n               in any form, through the Pekin convention, were it not that some friendsthathave thought and spoken differently, and I dislike to rebuke them<Page 9>for what they have not supposed to be injustice to you, while they have meant it\n               in kindness to me—yet, rather than be over-delicate, if you desire it, I will do it\n               any how– I repeat, I desirenothingfrom the Pekin convention– If I am not, (in services done the party, and in capacity\n               to serve in future) near enough your equal, when added to the fact of your having\n               had a turn, to entitle me to the nomination, I scorn it on any and all other grounds–\n               The question of capacity, I opine yourMorgan Journalcorrespondent will find little difficulty in deciding; and probably the District\n               may concur, with quite as little– A good long paragraph of your letter is occupied in an argument to prove that struggles\n               for the succession will break down the party– It is certain that struggles between\n               candidates, do not strengthen a party; but who are most responsible for these struggles,\n               those who are willing to live and let live, or those who are resolved, at all hazzards, to take care of \"number one\"?– Take, as an example, the very case in hand– You have\n               (and deservedly) many devoted friends; and they have been gratified by seeing you\n               in congress, and taking a stand that did high credit to you and to them– I also have\n               a few friends (I fear not enough) who, as well as your own, aided in giving you that\n               distinction– Is it natural that they shall be greatly pleased at hearing what they\n               helped to build up, turned into an argument, for keeping their own favourite<Page 10>down? Will they grow, and multiply on such grateful food? Is it by such exclusiveness\n               that you think a party will gain strength? In my letter to you, I reminded you that you hadfirsfirst atWashington, and afterwards at Pekin, said to me that if Baker succeeded he would most likely\n               hang on as long as possible, while with you it would be different– If I am not mistaken\n               in your having said this (and I am sure I am not) it seems youthenthought a little more favourably of \"turn about\" than you seem to now– And in writing your letter you seem to have\n               felt this; for that is about the only part of mine, that you have failed to notice– After, by way of imputations upon me, you have used the [...?]  the terms \"management\" \"manoevering\" and \"combination\" quite freely, you, in your closing paragraph say: \"For it is mortifying\n               to discover that those with whom I have long acted & from whom I expected a different\n               course, have considered it all fair to prevent my nomination to congress\"– Feeling,\n               as I do, the utter injustice of these imputations, it is somewhat difficult to be\n               patient under them– yet I content myself with saying that if there is cause for mortification\n               any where, it is in the readiness with which you believe, and make such charges, against\n               one with whom you truly say you have long acted; and in whose conduct, you<Page 11>have heretofore marked nothing as dishonorable– I believe you do not mean to be unjust, or ungenerous; and I, therefore am slow to\n               believe that you will not yet thinkbetterand thinkdifferentlyof this matter–",

      "Abraham Lincoln to John J. Hardin, 7 February 18461",
      "Your second letter was duly received and, so far as it goes, it is entirely satisfactory–2I had set apart the leisure this day affords, to write you the long letter alluded\n               to by me in my last;3but on going to thePost-office, and seeing the communication in theMorgan Journal, I am almost discouraged of the hope of doing any good by it; especially when I reflect\n               that most probably that communication was written with your knowledge,an^in^as much as it proceeds partly on information which could only have been furnished\n               by you–4",
      "However, as I suppose it can do noharm, I will proceed– Your letter, admiting my right to seek, or desire, a nomination forcongress, opens with an expression of dissatisfaction with themannerin which you think I have endeavoured to obtain it– Now,ifIhave, sought the nomination in animpropermanner; you have the right, to the extent, to be dissatisfied– But I deny allimproprietyon my part, in the matter–",
      "In the early part of your letter, you introduced the proposition made by me to you\n               andBaker, that we should take a turn a piece; and alluding to the principle you suppose be\n               involved in it, in an after part of your letter, you say– \"As awhigI have constantly combatted such practices when practiced among theLocos; & I do not see that they are<Page 2>any more praise worthy, or less anti-republican, when sought to be adopted by whigs\"–\n               Now, if my proposition had been that we (yourself, Baker & I) should be candidates\n               by turns, and that we should unite our strength throughout to keep down all other\n               candidates, I should not deny the justice of the censurable language you employ; but\n               if you so understood it, you wholly misunderstood it– I never expressed, nor meant\n               to express, that by such an arrangement, any one of us should be, in the least restricted\n               in his right to support any person he might choose, in the District; but only that\n               he should nothimself, be a candidate out of his turn– I felt then, and it seems to me Isaidthen, that even with such an arrangement, shouldGovernor Duncanbe a candidate, when you were not, it^would^be yourprevilegeand perhaps yourdutyto go for him–",
      "In this, the true sense of my\n               proposition, I deny that there is any thing [...?] censurable in it—any thing but^a spirit of^mutual concession, for harmony's sake–",
      "In this same connection you say, \"It is, in effect, acting upon the principle that\n               the District is a horse which each candidate may mount and ride a two mile heat without\n               consulting any body but the grooms & Jockeys\"–5Well, of course, you go the contrary of this principle; which is, in effect acting\n               on the principle that the District is a horse which, the first jockey that can mount\n               him, may whip and spur round and round, till jockey, or horse, or both, fall dead\n               on the track– And upon your principle, there is a fact<Page 3>as fatal to your claims as mine, which is, that neither you nor I, butBakeris the jockey now in the stirrups–",
      "\"Without consulting any body but the grooms & Jockeys\" is an implied charge that I\n               wish, in some way to interfere with the right of the people to select their candidate—I\n               do not understand it so– I, and my few friends say to the people that \"Turn about\n               is fair play\"– You and your friends do not meet this, and say \"Turn about isnotfair play\"– but insist the argument itself, ought not to be used– Fair or unfair,\n               why not trust the people to decide it?",
      "In the early part of your letter you say, \"It is also trueas stated by^that^you did come to my house early in September to know whether I desired to run, stating\n               that you wanted to give Baker a race\"– In this you are mistaken– I did not state to\n               you that I wanted to give Baker a race; but on the contrary I told you I believed\n               I could get Baker off the track– I do not know that you attached any importance to\n               what I am disavowing; but, on the contrary, I do not know but you mean it as the basis\n               of an inference that I acted deceitfully with you, in pretending to expect a contest\n               with Baker, when in fact I did not expect it–",
      "It is true, that after Baker's interview with you in September, he did send a letter,\n               by a messenger, to me at<Page 4>Tremont;6in which letter he detailed what passed at the interview, and the result, precisely\n               as you do, in substance; and in which letter he did urge me to relinquish my my pretensions– He had before told me that he would not be a candidate, if I desired\n               he should not; and he then repeated it; but at the same time argued that you, by having\n               been in congress, and^having^taken a high stand then, would in all probability beat me; so that the sacrafice he made for me, in declining, would, in the end, do me no good– And this is as near\n               as I ever came of hearing Baker express the determination that I should beat you,\n               if he could not; which you say you have learned he did– When he finally determined\n               to decline, he did express the wish that I might succeed; and he has since written\n               his letter of declension;7and whenthatis told; all I know, or believe, as to him,istold– If he has ever, in any way, attempted to dictate to any friend of his to go for\n               me in preference of you, it is more than I know or believe– That he has a part assigned\n               him to act in the drama, I know to be untrue– What I here say, is not in its nature\n               capable of very certain proof; but it may be said, that being where he is, he can\n               only opperate against you by letters– If he attempts this to any considerable extent, some of them\n               will fall into the hands of your friends who will apprize you of<Page 5>them– Have you yet seen or heard of any?",
      "I now quote from your letter again– \"You well knew I would not be a candidate for\n               Governor. Yet during the fall courts, whilst I learn you were obtaining pledges from\n               all the whigs you could to support you for the next candidate, my name was run up\n               as a candidate for Governor by one of your friends under circumstances which now leave\n               no room for doubt that the design was to keep my name out of view for congress, so\n               that the whigs might be more easily influenced to commit themselves to go for you–\"\n               Now this is a direct imputation that Iprocured, orwinked at, or in some way directly or indirectly,hadahandin, the nominating of you for Governor; and the imputation is to the utmost hair-breadth\n               of it, unjust– I neverknew, orbelieved, or had anysuspicion, that itwasdone, orwastobedone, until it was out, had gone toAlton, and been commented upon in theAlton paper, and came back to Springfield, and my attention was called to it byStuart, in ourcircuit courtroom, a few days, as I remember it, after you had been here attending to the case\n               ofThayervsFarrell, and had left–8I went immediately to theJournaloffice, and told them it was my wish that they should not fall in with the nomination\n               for Governor– They showed me a little paragraph, which they<Page 6>had already prepared, and which was published, and seen by you, as I suppose–9",

      "In another part of your letter you attempt to convict me of giving^a^double account as to my motive in introducing the resolution to the Convention atPekin– You say \"You then told me the object was to soothe Baker's mortified feelings, and\n               that it did not amount to a committal of any body\"– \"Now you say the object was to\n               give Baker the field for the next race, so as to keep the party together\"– I kept\n               no copy of my letter; but Iguessif you will turn to it, you will find that I have not, any where in it, said \"the\n               object was to give Baker the field for the next race &c” and then if you will allow that you may have committed as great a mistake, as to\n               what I told you at Pekin, you will find yourself a good deal short of the conviction\n               you intended. What I told^you^at Pekin I do not preciselyremberrecollect; but I am sure of some<Page 8>things I didnottell you or any one else– If you shall say that I told you it wasanobject with me, in introducing the resolution, to soothe Baker's  feelings, I shall\n               admit it; but if you shall say I told^you that,^that wasthesoleobject, I deny it–",
      "If you shall say I then told you that the passage of the resolution amounted to a\n               committal of no one, I deny that also; but if you shall say I then told you, it amounted\n               to a committal of no one, except the delegates, generally who voted for it, and me,\n               particularly, who introduced it, I shall not deny it–",
      "This much, and no more, as a committal, I always supposed it to amount to; and I guess\n               you will be able to find nothing in my late letter to you that is inconsistent with\n               this– And I here add, that I have not since entering this contest with you, or at\n               any time, sought to appropriate to myself any benefit from that resolution, ether as settling the succession to pass through me, or as settling a principle that shall\n               give the succession that direction– I have said that \"Turn about is fair play\"; but\n               this I have said just as I would, if that resolution [h?] had never been thought of– I should not hesitate to say publicly, that I claim nothing,\n               in any form, through the Pekin convention, were it not that some friendsthathave thought and spoken differently, and I dislike to rebuke them<Page 9>for what they have not supposed to be injustice to you, while they have meant it\n               in kindness to me—yet, rather than be over-delicate, if you desire it, I will do it\n               any how– I repeat, I desirenothingfrom the Pekin convention– If I am not, (in services done the party, and in capacity\n               to serve in future) near enough your equal, when added to the fact of your having\n               had a turn, to entitle me to the nomination, I scorn it on any and all other grounds–\n               The question of capacity, I opine yourMorgan Journalcorrespondent will find little difficulty in deciding; and probably the District\n               may concur, with quite as little–",
      "A good long paragraph of your letter is occupied in an argument to prove that struggles\n               for the succession will break down the party– It is certain that struggles between\n               candidates, do not strengthen a party; but who are most responsible for these struggles,\n               those who are willing to live and let live, or those who are resolved, at all hazzards, to take care of \"number one\"?– Take, as an example, the very case in hand– You have\n               (and deservedly) many devoted friends; and they have been gratified by seeing you\n               in congress, and taking a stand that did high credit to you and to them– I also have\n               a few friends (I fear not enough) who, as well as your own, aided in giving you that\n               distinction– Is it natural that they shall be greatly pleased at hearing what they\n               helped to build up, turned into an argument, for keeping their own favourite<Page 10>down? Will they grow, and multiply on such grateful food? Is it by such exclusiveness\n               that you think a party will gain strength?",
      "In my letter to you, I reminded you that you hadfirsfirst atWashington, and afterwards at Pekin, said to me that if Baker succeeded he would most likely\n               hang on as long as possible, while with you it would be different– If I am not mistaken\n               in your having said this (and I am sure I am not) it seems youthenthought a little more favourably of \"turn about\" than you seem to now– And in writing your letter you seem to have\n               felt this; for that is about the only part of mine, that you have failed to notice–",
      "After, by way of imputations upon me, you have used the [...?]  the terms \"management\" \"manoevering\" and \"combination\" quite freely, you, in your closing paragraph say: \"For it is mortifying\n               to discover that those with whom I have long acted & from whom I expected a different\n               course, have considered it all fair to prevent my nomination to congress\"– Feeling,\n               as I do, the utter injustice of these imputations, it is somewhat difficult to be\n               patient under them– yet I content myself with saying that if there is cause for mortification\n               any where, it is in the readiness with which you believe, and make such charges, against\n               one with whom you truly say you have long acted; and in whose conduct, you<Page 11>have heretofore marked nothing as dishonorable–",
