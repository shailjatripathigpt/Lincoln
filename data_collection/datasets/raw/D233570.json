        "text": "2From December 1848 to February 1849, Abraham Lincoln received several letters urging\n                  him to help Turner R. King secure a job at theU.S. General Land Office.  On April 7, 1849, Lincoln wrote aletterto Secretary of the InteriorThomas Ewingrecommending King for the job of register.    On April 13, he wrote anotherletterreversing himself, recommending King for the job of receiver.  On May 10, Lincoln\n                  reversed himself again, penning aletterrecommending King for register. In late May, King received the appointment as register\n                  and held the job until 1853.There is no evidence that Lincoln took similar pains to get Briggs a position.  Briggs’\n                  name does not appear in the official registers of the officers and agents of the government\n                  for 1849, 1851, and 1853, so apparently he did not receive an appointment.Niles’ National Register(Philadelphia, PA), 23 May 1849, 1:2;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 135;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1851(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1851), 140;Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the\n                        United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1853(Washington, DC: Robert Armstrong, 1853), 138;Philo H.
