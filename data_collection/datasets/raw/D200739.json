        "text": "3Abraham Lincoln wrote and signed this endorsement.The precise date of Lincoln’s endorsement is unknown, but he probably penned it after\n                  the end of the spring term of theU.S. Circuit Court, District of Illinois, and before he left Springfield to conduct legal business on theEighth Judicial Circuit.  Lewis W. Ross and George W. Stipp wrote Lincoln four days after the U.S. Circuit\n                  Court convened in Springfield.  Lincoln and his partnerWilliam H. Herndonhad a heavy court schedule during the period from March 25 to April 2, when the court\n                  recessed, leaving Lincoln little time for a response.  On April 4, moreover,Mary Lincolngave birth toTad Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln’s fourth son.  On April 10, Abraham left Springfield to ride the\n                  circuit, returning home on or around June 6.  Lincoln mostly likely answered Ross\n                  and Stipp between April 3 and 9, 1853.Ross and Stipp requested Lincoln’s assistance in an ejectment case involving Thomas\n                  J. Northrup.  As indicated in Lincoln’s endorsement, the court found in favor of Northrup,\n                  the plaintiff, by default.Roy P.
