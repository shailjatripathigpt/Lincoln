I should think that farming as it is carried on in this Countrywill^would^be an employment that would Suit George & by engaging his attention would dispel\n               ennui, which feeling is almost inseparable from an inactive life, The mind must be\n               engaged on something  & if it has not external objects to act upon it will turn inwardly\n               & create dulness & abstraction. This Climate is rather damp than dry & subject to sudden changes, but we seldom have\n               an East wind & it never rains from that quarter— It almost invariably storms from\n               the S. W[South West]— which wind blows ¾ of the year— The winter sets in about 1st of Jany[January] & last 6 or 8 weeks— Billious Fever & Ague & Fever prevails more or less throughout the State & particularly\n               in the South where the land is flat & wet—4I do not know that it^is^healthier in the northern than in the middle Counties—Morgan&Sangamonare two as good counties as is in the stateThe River towns & in fact any situation near the water or swampy grounds is quite\n               unhealthy,  the country being so level that the water courses move quite slow— The\n               milk sickness, which I presume is but little known in the East as those who live in\n               such places keep the knowledge of it to themselves in order that they^may^have a chance of selling out— It exists in many of the southern counties &  those\n               that border on theWabash— such places are by all means to be avoided, for neither the milk or5flesh of the Cattle that are affected with it can be used—6 The true cause has not yet been ascertained, but is supposed to spring from the stock\n               eating some weed when the dew is onit— Most of the Emigrants to this state from the south came, & still come in their waggons\n               & always camp out & expose themselves very much after their arrival which is enough\n               to make any one sick; &  then the first settlers had no conveniences & when taken\n               sick had no Doctor or physic<Page 2>and were obliged to wear out the disease— Either of these diseases readily give way\n               to medicine and are the only ones we have here, so that the Doctors have acquired\n               a perfect knowledge of them— The Ague & Fever Can be cured in 2 days at the expence\n               of $1 or $2— Two or three remedies have been made known within a year that stops it\n               on every one who has taken it— I used considerable Quinine last fall, but it only\n               stops it a short time for the least cold a person gets afterwards renders its return\n               certain— It did not let me have an intermission of more than a week— what is singular\n               itiscomes only in warm weather & the subject has a great appetite when the fever is not\n               on— This summer my health has been extremely good. I have made use of Bitters made\n               of Indian turnip. Blood root & sarsaparilla, the first is very warming & the latter\n               two are excellent for the blood— I have no fear of the ague now— There has been more\n               sickness this summer than ever was known before— deaths however are rare & I am of\n               opinion that as a general [thing?] people enjoy better health here than in the East, for there is hardly a family there\n               but what has some member of^it^afflicted with some local complaint or other, which I think may be attributed to\n               their manner of living; while here when all the food is simple people are never sick\n               except in Augt[August]  & Septr[September] & we have not any lingering Complaints like the Consumption—7 I must acknowledge that florid complexions are more rare than in the East— For my own part I am well satisfied with the country & much prefer living here than\n               inN. England— Caroline is a good natured girl & this is all that be Said in her favour, there never\n               was any congeniality between8us— her mind wants discipline— Emily possesses a more vigorous imagination which\n               gave impulse to her feelings, tinctured her conversation with good ideas & rendered\n               her on the whole very pleasing— It was altogether the mind expressed in her countenance\n               & not her features that were attractive— I was made a fool offonce & may be again, but I^now^have some experience in affairs of the heart— It seems H. P. is lost to me— I sent\n               3 weeks since a paper containing a discription of this country to J. W. P— The alterations Geo found in his visit to [md?] were probably as great as is to be met with— I was aware of the Change when I made\n               my delightful excursions there— The Miss. H’s are worth looking after— What C. C wrote\n               about my being attentive to a“suckergirl”9had some truth in it— Yes! her name isMarthaJaneShort& lives in Morgan County on Indian Creek, the timber of which can be seen from here distant 13 miles acrost a Prairie in the\n               S. West. direction, She possesses more qualities which assimilates with my peculiar\n               disposition & comes nearer to the standard of what I consider essential in a wife\n               than any other girl I have ever seen— In stature, middling height— & slim— light brown\n               hair, black eyes, which suppress half their fire until she speaks, then through their\n               soft disguise will flash an expression more of pride than ire, & of love than either—\n               Her age 20—  Such is all the description I can give of the girl who at present stands\n               the highest in my estimation— How long she will continue to do so, I cannot assure\n               even myself as I havenaturallyafickledisposition— But as I have told you all in a previous letter if you Could Come here\n               to live I never will marry but devote all my attention to seeing you made happy—10 I have one objection to marrying in this State, & that is, the women have such an\n               everlasting number of children— twelve is the least number that can be counted on—\n               The natural increase of this state I know is greater than any other, which with Emigration\n               will run the population this<Page 3>census (1835) to at least 250 or 300,000— I am glad that there is some enterprise left Among thePortsmocapitalists, & that you have the Railroad in prospect— If Real Estate rises in value\n               in consiquence of the contemplated work— sell out & come here where the money can\n               be so much more advantageously invested— I am sensible of the difficulties to be encountered in winding up— Mr B.appearsvery friendly to me & I believe is a little afraid of getting me displeased— I heard\n               from M & S. A. [in?] a letter dated about 20th July, in which S. A. told me of her beaux— your letters,\n               (that is) fromN.Y& Portsmo came together as generally happenss— I have not heard from W. Melcher—\n               Sorry Geo did not see the [Ollys?]— I still have my eye or rather mind on 3 girls there & they are Martha— L. I. Hill\n               & miss Giles— Do let me know how the lattercomeson & don[’]t fail— You ask, “is” there a prospect of my place growing rapidly— I[s]uppose you must mean New Salem— No; that stoped 2 yrs since [?] Town ([in?] a bad place) 2 miles lower down on theRiveris likely to become the County Seat of a new County which will be made by dividing\n               this one & taking some off ofsomeothers— ThisCountyis nowmiles square— The town (Petersburg) is only one by name having but 2 stores— 2 houses & a Coblers[cobbler's] shop— S. Haven acted indiscretly in regard to the Turnbull affair— I hardly expected Clarke\n               would go to P— as I look for him every day & the mail does not go out till the 22dI will omit till then a conclusive answer in regard to the money: &^to^the Articles sent by him— I have no hesitation^in saying^that money Could not be better invested than in land & there is not any question\n               of its safety, Land will always be valuable here as every foot of it is susceptible\n               of cultivation— no stones or broken land to obstruct the free course of the plough—\n               Not less the 75,000 acres is entered monthly at theSpringfieldLand office— Speculators are taking it up  wherever they can find. Some individuals\n               have entered 20.000 acres in one day— Prairie & timber adjoining Cannot be entered\n               any where in the state— It is difficult finding where the unentered lands lay, nothing\n               Can be found out from the settlers as they wish the range open— The [Land?] is not surveyed to the buyer— who must look the land out & procure the numbers— If\n               the land is [adjacent?] to [any?] he owns, he can guess pretty near— One person is not allowed to enter but 2— 40 acre\n               lots & then has to take an oath that he wants them for farming purposes & not for\n               speculation or in trust for another— I have already entered my 2— 40s— Any one Can enter as many 80sas they choose— There is some first rate praire about 2 miles S.w of this that I should like to enter\n               160 acres off as a company intend taking the whole tract & I could almost oblige them\n               to take this— What retards them is the difficulty of getting timber of which there\n               is none to enter any where near this— Distance appears the same on these prairies\n               as on water & in fact as [there?] is no hills 2 miles is as easy to haul  over as one with you. I do not know but that\n               there has been more land entered the past year than there had the five preceding—\n               I hope they will find the Coal on Gerrishs Island.

Congress never extended that privilege to state\n                  legislators. Abuse was rife under the system, prompting charges of corruption and\n                  misfeasance, and Congress briefly abolished the privilege after the Civil War, only\n                  to reinstate it after a few years.James D.
