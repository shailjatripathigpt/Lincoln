Blanchard a promissory note for $1,000 and secured\n                  the note with a mortgage on five lots in Springfield, Illinois, and two hundred acres\n                  inMenard County, Illinois.  Blanchard assigned the notes and mortgage to Fithian.  Mobley gave Fithian three\n                  promissory notes totaling $1,590 and secured the notes with a mortgage on the same\n                  property.  After Mobley failed to pay, Fithian retainedLincoln & Herndonand sued Mobley,Mobley's wife, and Blanchard to foreclose the mortgage in theSangamon County Circuit Court.  Fithian dismissed the case concerning Blanchard.  Fithian and Mobley agreed on\n                  a judgment against Mobley for $1,080 on the Blanchard mortgage without redemption\n                  and $2,095.20 on the Fithian mortgage with redemption.  The court sold all of the\n                  land for a total of $2,423.  Fithian accepted two drafts totaling $949.34 as satisfaction\n                  of the judgment on the condition that Mobley would pay both drafts at maturity.
