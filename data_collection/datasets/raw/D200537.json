        "text": "3Henry Newman was eager to get the back pay due Joseph Newman for his service in theMexican War, and he wrote Lincoln aletterin December 1848 appointing Lincoln as his attorney and essentially giving Lincoln\n                  his power of attorney to secure the money.  A war veteran himself, Diefendorf had\n                  established an office inWashington, DCto settle claims for bounty lands, extra pay, and pensions due soldiers who participated\n                  in the war.  Presumably Lincoln and Diefendorf appeared together at theWar Departmentto give testimony in the case.  The person before whom Lincoln and Diefendorf testified--the\n                  author of the affidavit text--is unknown.Illinois Journal(Weekly) (Springfield), 3 October 1848, 3:5."
