        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote the first page of this letter; pages two and three are in a\n                  different hand.  The top and the bottom have been cut off.The recipient and the date of this letter is uncertain.  Roy P. Basler, editor ofThe Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, has John Constant as the recipient, without attribution, but this seems unlikely,\n                  given how Lincoln refers to Constant in the manuscript.  Another possibility is Andrew\n                  Fogg, for whom Lincoln wrote a judgement decree in 1847 in a legal proceeding involving\n                  Constant.Basler postulates that Lincoln wrote the letter sometime after August 27, 1844, again\n                  without attribution.  The letter’s tone and contents give some credence to Basler’s\n                  view, but Lincoln could have easily written the manuscript anytime after November\n                  1843, when Constant received a judgment in a lawsuit against John White.  The editors\n                  believe the evidence suggests that Lincoln wrote this letter sometime after Constant’s\n                  judgment in November 1843 and before he wrote the judgment for Fogg in May 1847.Roy P. Basler, ed.,The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 8:421;Constant v. White, Martha L.

        "text": "2White gave Constant four promissory notes totaling $1,200 and secured them with a\n                  mortgage on one acre and four lots inSpringfield, Illinois.  After White failed to pay, Constant retainedLogan & Lincolnand sued White in an action of scire facias to foreclose the mortgage.  Logan & Lincoln\n                  pleaded the case in theSangamon County Circuit Courtin November 1843.  White defaulted, and the court ruled for Constant and awarded\n                  $1,266.16.  The court ordered the sheriff to sell the land to pay the judgment.  Constant\n                  purchased the property at public auction and deeded 7/12 of the land to Fogg and 5/12\n                  to a certain Williams, to whom he was indebted.    The court gave White fifteen months\n                  to redeem the property.    George W. Shoudy held a note against Constant and assigned\n                  the note to Fogg.  Constant's land transfer to Fogg was not sufficient to pay his\n                  debt to Fogg, and Fogg filed a claim against Shoudy's estate to recover the debt on\n                  Constant's note.  Lincoln wrote the judgment decree for Fogg as the basis of Fogg's\n                  claim against Shoudy's estate.  Fogg received $92.17 from Shoudy's estate.Constant v. White, Martha L.
