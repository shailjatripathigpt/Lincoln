        "text": "4In thecongressional election of 1854, Whig Richard Yates, the incumbent, vied against DemocratThomas L. Harris, to see who would represent the Illinois Sixth Congressional District in theU.S. House of Representatives. Harris defeated Yates by 200 votes, garnering 50.5 percent of the vote to Yates’\n                  49.5 percent.Controversy erupted in 1853 when the board of trustees of theIllinois State Asylum and Hospital for the Insanerelieved SuperintendentJames M. Higginsof his duties.  Higgins contested his removal, and the trustees sued Higgins in the\n                  Morgan County Circuit Court to enforce the removal.  Yates, who had sponsored the\n                  bill that established the Illinois State Asylum and Hospital for the Insane in 1847,\n                  represented the trustees in this lawsuit.  The court ruled for Higgins, and the trustees\n                  appealed to theIllinois Supreme Court. Lincoln represented Higgins before the Supreme Court, which in March 1854, reversed\n                  the lower court ruling and upheld the trustees’ decision to remove Higgins.In aletterto Yates dated October 30, Lincoln warned Yates that certain “English” in Morgan\n                  County might turn against Yates over rumors that he was a Know Nothing and offered\n                  a campaign letter to assist Yates--to no avail.In thecongressional election of 1852, Yates had 1,677 votes in Morgan County to 1,288 votes forJohn Calhoun, his Democratic opponent. In Scott County, Yates garnered 780 votes to Calhoun’s\n                  648 votes.  In 1854, Yates received 1,591 votes in Morgan County  to 1,409 for Harris.\n                  In Scott County, Harris garnered 744 votes to 665 for Yates.  In the rest of the district,\n                  Yates wonJersey,Menard, andSangamoncounties,  and  Harris wonCass,Christian, Greene,Macoupin,Montgomery, andShelbycounties.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 171; Michael F.

In fact, Miller performed best in the state’s three northernmost\n                  districts.

        "text": "9In Illinois’ Seventh Congressional District, Democrat James C. Allen narrowly won\n                  an intensely competitive race against Republican William B. Archer. The contest came\n                  down to a single vote: Allen received 8,452 votes to Archer’s 8,451. Allen received\n                  the certificate of election, but Archer contested the outcome.Congressnullified the results and left the seat vacant until a new election could be held.\n                  In August 1856, Allen defeated Archer in a special election.Lincoln, whose passion for politics was reawakened by the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromise, allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General Assembly (albeit\n                  unwillingly at first).  He threw himself into the congressional election campaign\n                  in the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska\n                  Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates, including Yates and Williams.  As\n                  the election campaign reached its climax, his name began to circulate as a possible\n                  nominee for one of the state’sU.S. Senateseats. He won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, in late-November 1854,\n                  declined to serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln  did not\n                  win election to the U.S. Senate. In February 1855, the Illinois General Assembly—\n                  with its new anti-Nebraska majority—selected Trumbull instead. See the1854 Federal Election.Howard W. Allen and Vincent A.
