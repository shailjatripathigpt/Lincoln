Toombsthat attempted to quell the escalatingpolitical violence in Kansasby formulating a process for bringing the territory into the union as a new state.The portion of the debate over the bill that Lincoln references centered upon whether\n                  theKansas Territorial Legislaturehad the right “at any time to exclude slavery or allow it,” or whether that right\n                  was reserved for states. Trumbull argued that all territorial legislatures should\n                  have the right and wanted this made explicit in the bill via amendment. Douglas argued\n                  that it was a “constitutional question” for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide. The\n                  Senate ultimately rejected Trumbull’s amendment on the topic.In a July 5letterto Lincoln, Trumbull discussed the debates over the Toombs bill, claiming “Douglas\n                  has been perfectly whipped out of his self government, non-intervention & popular\n                  sovereignty dogmas.” Toombs’ bill passed the Senate, which had a Democratic majority,\n                  on  July 2, but ultimately failed in theU.S. House of Representatives, in which Republicans held a majority.S. 356.  34th Cong. 1st sess.

Although Douglas\n                  refused to debate Lincoln during the 1854 election campaign, after Douglas concluded\n                  an address given at the opening of the Illinois State Fair on October 3, 1854, Lincoln\n                  announced to the crowd that he or Trumbull would answer Douglas the next day and invited\n                  Douglas to attend and respond. Lincoln delivered a speech to a large crowd gathered in theIllinois House of Representativeshall on October 4. Douglas not only attended but interrupted and bantered with Lincoln\n                  from a seat directly in front of him and, after Lincoln concluded, offered a nearly\n                  two-hour rejoinder.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln, 173-74, 177."

Under Article one, section three of the U.S. Constitution,\n                  the Senate president pro tempore assumed the duties of president of the Senate in\n                  the absence of the vice president. Since President Franklin Pierce had no vice president\n                  after King’s death, this technically made Atchison the acting vice president of the\n                  United States, and, consequently, second in line for the presidency.Jesse D. Brightwas president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate at the time that Lincoln delivered this\n                  speech.When the Thirty-Third Congress opened its second session in December 1854, Atchison\n                  did not appear; he was leading pro-slavery forces inBleeding Kansasinstead. In his absence, the Senate elected firstLewis Cassand later Bright president pro tempore.  When Atchison returned to the Senate on\n                  December 22, 1854, Bright offered to step aside so that Atchison could reclaim the\n                  role, but Atchison declined. Atchison failed in his bid for reelection, leaving the\n                  Senate in March 1855 and  becoming a leader of pro-slavery forces in the Kansas Territory\n                  throughout 1855 and 1856. This series of events is what Lincoln means when he refers\n                  to Atchison resigning his seat as acting vice president to take up the job of “making\n                  a slave State out of Kansas.”Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1949, 19, 251, 890; U.S. SenateJournal. 1853. 33rd Cong., special sess., 331; U.S. Const. art.

Although\n                  Lincoln had declined other requests to speak outside Illinois during the 1856 campaign,\n                  he acceptedHezekiah G. Wells’ invitation to speak in Kalamazoo. He was the only speaker from outsideMichiganto speak at the event.Ultimately, Buchanan won the presidency. See the1856 Federal Election. In Illinois, Buchanan won 44.1 percent of the vote to Fremont’s 40.2 percent and\n                  Fillmore’s 15.7 percent. In Michigan, Fremont won 57.2 percent of the vote compared\n                  to Buchanan’s 41.5 percent and Fillmore’s 1.3 percent.As many predicted, sectionalism played a significant role in the success of each party\n                  during the election. Nationally, Buchanan won 174 electoral votes to Fremont’s 114\n                  and Fillmore’s eight. Although Buchanan received the majority of his electoral votes\n                  from states below the Mason-Dixon line, he earned some support from free states, winningNew Jersey,Pennsylvania, Illinois, andCalifornia. Fremont’s electoral votes came entirely from the North, and he performed so well\n                  that the election established the Republican Party as the major anti-Democratic party\n                  in the North. Fillmore’s only electoral win wasMarylandand, overall, he performed better in the South than in the North.Abraham Lincoln to James W. Grimes;Abraham Lincoln to Joel B.

They tell us that the Union\n                  is in danger. Who will divide it? Is it those who make the charge? Are they themselves\n                  the persons who wish to see this result?

When this Nebraska bill was first introduced into Congress,\n                  the sense of theDemocratic partywas outraged.19That party has ever prided itself, that it was the friend of individual, universal\n                  freedom. It was that principle upon which they carried their measures. When theKansas schemewas conceived, it was natural that this respect and sense should have been outraged.\n                  Now I make this appeal to the Democratic citizens here. Don’t you find yourself making\n                  arguments in support of these measures, which you never would have made before? Did\n                  you ever do it before this Nebraska bill compelled you to do it? If you answer this\n                  in the affirmative, see how a whole party have been turned away from their love of\n                  liberty! And now, my Democratic friends, come forward. Throw off these things, and\n                  come to the rescue of this great principle of equality. Don’t interfere with anything\n                  in the Constitution.— That must be maintained, for it is the only safeguard of our\n                  liberties. And not to Democrats alone do I make this appeal, but to all who love these\n                  great and true principles. Come, and keep coming! Strike, and strike again! So sure\n                  as God lives, the victory shall be yours.(Great cheering.)20"
