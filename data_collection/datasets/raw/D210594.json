        "text": "3Randolph is discussing Lincoln’s candidacy for a seat in theU.S. Senate. Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates.  He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political allies,\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects. He likely did\n                  the same in his November 29 letter to Randolph.Lincoln won election to the Illinois General Assembly, but, on November 25, 1854,\n                  officiallydeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Per article three, section seven of\n                  the1848 Illinois State Constitution, state legislators were ineligible for election to the U.S. Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73; Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln Written for John L.

However, as three additional\n                  letters from Randolph reveal, Lincoln wrote him at least a few times in December 1854.The race between Richardson and Williams was close.  Richardson won 52.4 percent of\n                  the Fifth Congressional District’s votes to Williams’ 47.6 percent. In McDonough County,\n                  the county in which Macomb was located, Richardson emerged with 50.7 percent of the\n                  vote to Williams’ 49.3 percent.Lincoln and Williams both became candidates for U.S. Senate when the General Assembly\n                  gathered in joint session to vote on February 8, 1855.  Williams received votes on\n                  the second, third, fourth, ninth, and tenth ballots.  Lincoln received a majority\n                  of the anti-Nebraska votes until the tenth and final ballot, when he withdrew and\n                  urged his supporters to vote for anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With the votes\n                  of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat.  Waters switched his allegiance back\n                  and forth between Lincoln, Williams, andOrville H. Browningbefore casting his vote in the tenth and final ballot for Williams--becoming the\n                  only Whig not to unite on Trumbull’s candidacy.  See the1854 Federal Election. Stung and disappointed by his loss, Lincoln made no political speeches or public\n                  statements for an entire year after his defeat and reinvested his energies in his\n                  law practice.William H.
