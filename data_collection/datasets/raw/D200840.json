        "text": "4The bond and correspondence Lincoln enclosed in this letter consisted of a bond for\n                  $2,000 and two letters fromJames S. Sandford,Mortimer Porter, andGarrit H. Striker, Jr.—one penned December 15, 1854 and the other March 5, 1855. The bond and letters concerned\n                  an attachment suit brought on by one Mr.PrayagainstSamuel A. Clift.  Clift had made a bond with  Pray for $2,000.  Clift had failed to pay the bond,\n                  and Pray had commenced an attachment suit to collect the debt.   Attachment involved\n                  a legal action through which a plaintiff could have the court seize the defendant’s\n                  personal or real property pending the outcome of a case involving a debt of $20 or\n                  more; creditors frequently used attachment against debtors.  Although both Clift and\n                  Pray were residents ofNew York, Clift had a 330-acre farm one mile fromRushville, out of which Pray, in his attachment suit, wished the collection be made. In their\n                  letter of December 15, 1854,  Sandford, Porter, and Striker sent Lincoln the bond\n                  for collection.  Lincoln failed to collect the debt, noting in hisreplyto Sandford, Porter, and Striker of March 10, 1855, that he had been “dabbling in\n                  politics”--reference to his successful bid to win a seat in theU.S. Senate.     LincolnwroteDummer on March 10 explaining the case  and asking if he would accept the work. \n                  The final outcome of the case is unknown.

The1848 Illinois Constitutiondivided the state into three grand divisions, each division to elect one of the justices\n                  on the court.
