No response from Lincoln to either letter has been located.Lundy’s invitations stemmed from Lincoln’s recent nomination at the1858 Illinois Republican Conventionto run against incumbentStephen A. Douglasto representIllinoisin theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both focused their\n                  campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  See1858 Federal Election.Putnam, Marshall, and La Salle counties, however, were among the northern Illinois\n                  counties assumed to be strongly Republican in 1858, and that proved to be the case\n                  in the state elections of that year. Putnam and Marshall counties were in the Eight\n                  Illinois Senate District, where RepublicanGeorge C. BestordefeatedDemocratWilliam S. Moss. The two counties were in the Forty-Second Illinois House District,\n                  which elected RepublicanJohn A. McCallover Democrat Washington E. Cook. La Salle County was located in the Seventh Illinois\n                  Senate District, where RepublicanBurton C. Cookheld over in the election of 1858, and was in the Forty-Third Illinois House District,\n                  in which RepublicansAlexander CampbellandRichardson S. Hickdefeated Democratic candidates Samuel C. Collins and William Cogswell.Allen C.
