Miller filled in the blanks and filed the bill and supporting documents with\n                  theWoodford County Circuit Courton August 27, 1855.The bill and this note are associated with a lawsuit between John L. and Susan F.\n                  Miller.  John L.  Miller married Susan F. Rockwell inWoodford County, Illinois, on November 15, 1849.  The couple lived together as husband and wife until October\n                  31, 1852, when, according to John, Susan left the family home.  Susan absented herself\n                  from home for two years, and John retained Lincoln and sued Susan in the Woodford\n                  County Circuit Court in April 1855 for divorce on the grounds of desertion.  Susan\n                  answered that she left John because he mistreated her, spread illicit rumors about\n                  her, and refused to allow her to see her family.  John dismissed the case but later\n                  reinstated it.  At the September term of the Woodford County Circuit Court, Susan\n                  failed to appear, and the court granted the divorce.Bill of Divorce, Document ID: 4456; Answer, Document ID: 56837; Decree, Document ID:\n                     56854,Miller v.
