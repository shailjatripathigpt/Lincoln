Walters\n                  failed to appear, and the court ruled for VanBergen and Speed, awarding $1,155 in\n                  damages. Walters failed to pay the judgment, and Speed purchased the lots at auction.\n                  Walters later redeemed the lots by paying Lincoln, who kept a record and forwarded\n                  the payments to Speed.VanBergen for use of Speed v.
