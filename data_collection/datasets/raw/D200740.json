Dorman and his wife,Nancy Dorman, in two legal cases and, in February 1845, received a mortgage on 160 acres of land\n                  nearShawneetown, Illinoisin Gallatin County in order to secure his legal fee if he won their case.In the case,John Lanesued William and Nancy Dorman in 1841 as the heirs toChristopher Robinson’s estate, which owed him $1,000. In September 1842, theGallatin County Circuit Courtruled for Lane, and the Dormans retained Lincoln to appeal to theIllinois Supreme Court. The Supreme  Court ruled for the Dormans, basing its opinion upon Lincoln’s arguments.\n                  Lincoln also successfully  represented the Dormans in another Supreme Court appeal\n                  following a second attempt by Robinson’s estate and heirs to collect the debt.Lincoln never took possession of the land the Dormans mortgaged him, and, with this\n                  deed, he and Mary Lincoln sold the land to Dorman for $100.Harry E.
