Baker not receiving a patronage position in President\n                  Taylor’s cabinet, which Baker sought in the aftermath of the Whig victory in the1848 election. On February 27, 1849, LincolnwrotePresident Taylor  to urge Baker’s appointment, enclosing apetitionsigned by the Whig members of theIllinois General Assemblyendorsing Baker.   However, President Taylor did not offer Baker a cabinet position.\n                  Like his predecessorJames K. Polk, Taylor apportioned his cabinet selections geographically. Ewing ofOhiorepresented the “Old Northwest” as secretary of the interior.Baker represented the state’s sixth congressional district as a Whig in theThirty-First Congress(1849-1851). Before his election, Illinois’ sixth congressional district was represented\n                  byDemocratsJoseph P. Hoge(1843-1847) andThomas J. Turner(1847-1849).Elbert B.

Prior to the election, Taylor promised to reward all who supported him equally once\n                  he became president, irrespective of their political affiliation.  After the election,\n                  President Taylor also hoped that by allowing several of President James K. Polk’s\n                  last-minute Democratic appointments to stand,  and by appointing Democrats himself,\n                  he would gain Democratic support for Whig candidates—or at least not raise the ire\n                  of Democratic voters. His administration paid particular attention to Virginia’s Democrats.\n                  Four Democrats from Virginia were appointed to new terms, Virginia was permitted to\n                  keep its Democratic postmasters, custom collectors, U.S. marshals, and U.S. attorneys,\n                  and more than sixty Democratic Virginian clerks inWashington, DCwere permitted to keep their jobs. Many Whigs were upset and demoralized by President\n                  Taylor’s Virginia policy, particularly after the Democratic Party won numerous elections\n                  in 1849.Michael F.
