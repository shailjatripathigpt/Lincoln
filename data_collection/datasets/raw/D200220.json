Lincoln was perhaps interested inMartin Van Buren’s role in that gathering.  During thepresidential campaign of 1840, Lincoln sought to counter theDemocraticclaim thatWilliam Henry Harrisonwas anabolitionistby repeating an accusation, originally made in the1836 election, that Van Buren endorsed enfranchisement for free blacks during the 1821 convention.\n                  Lincoln perhaps hoped to further substantiate his claims using the journal/debates.Nathaniel H.
