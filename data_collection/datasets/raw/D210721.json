TheChicago Daily Press and Tribunereported on the festivities in Princeton and the disappointment at the absence of\n                  Lincoln: “The first inquiry made by the farmers as they flocked in was, ‘Has Lincoln\n                  come?’\t The rumor had spread the day previous, that his coming was doubtful, and every\n                  Illinoisian was anxious to hear the man who, in addition to his long-sustained character\n                  for ability and eloquence, just now occupies so commanding a position as the standard-bearer\n                  of theRepublicanarmy ofIllinois. For once rumor was true. Lincoln did not come.”  Lincoln alsodeclinedaninvitationto attend Independence Day celebrations held on July 5 inChicago.
