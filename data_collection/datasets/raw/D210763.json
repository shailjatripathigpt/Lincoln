See1858 Illinois Republican Convention.Politicians and party managers often scheduled political meetings to coincide with\n                  circuses, fairs, and other local festivities to ensure a large audience.  Circus tents\n                  also provided a public place for large crowds to congregate.  In the 1858 senatorial\n                  campaign, Lincoln and Douglas spoke in several localities in conjunction with circus\n                  performances or fairs.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Richard E.

Lincoln ultimately did not address the crowds at the Winnebago\n                  County Agricultural Society’s annual fair. Between September 22 and 24, he delivered\n                  campaign speeches inDanville, IllinoisandUrbana, Illinoisinstead. At the time, the northern counties of Illinois—such asWinnebago—were a Republican stronghold, but central Illinois was competitive. Both Lincoln\n                  and Douglas focused their 1858 campaigns on central Illinois.In the local elections of 1858, Republicans won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois,\n                  but pro-DouglasDemocratsretained control of theIllinois General Assembly. At the time,  members of the General Assembly voted for and elected the state’s\n                  representatives in the U.S. Senate, and Douglas won reelection. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in theLincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained national recognition as well as standing within the Republican Party.The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, September 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarMonth&year=1858&month=9; Allen C.
