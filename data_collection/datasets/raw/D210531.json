In early June 1849, Lincoln sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting\n                  letters in support of his candidacy for commissioner.Originally, onlyJustin H. Butterfield,James L. D. Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. In late May 1849, LincolnwroteThompson a letter on the topic of Butterfield winning the appointment. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B. Herrick;Abraham Lincoln to James M.
