        "text": "2Lincoln is discussing the caseChicago, Burlington, & Quincy RR v. Wilson. In late-November 1855, theChicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroadfiled a petition in theKane County Circuit Courtrequesting that JudgeIsaac G. Wilson, judge ofIllinois’ Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, appoint commissioners to condemn and assess compensation\n                  for land inAurora, Illinoisthat the railroad acquired in order to build workshops, depots, engine houses, and\n                  the like. Wilson denied the petition, ruling that the railroad’s charter did not give\n                  it the power to condemn land for such purposes after the road’s initial construction\n                  work was completed. In December 1855, the railroad applied to theIllinois Supreme Courtfor a writ of mandamus to compel Wilson to appoint the commissioners. A mandamus\n                  is a writ issued by a superior court compelling the person or inferior court to whom\n                  the writ is issued to perform some specified act. Writs of mandamus are only used\n                  in exceptional cases when all other means of enforcement have been unsuccessful.James F. Joy andWilliam B. Platorepresented the railroad; Lincoln and Grant Goodrich represented Wilson. Charles\n                  Hoyt was one of the landowners who opposed and fought the condemnation. In December\n                  1855,  the Supreme Court  ruled that Wilson had misinterpreted the railroad’s charter\n                  and awarded the mandamus.Henry Campbell Black,A Dictionary of Law(St. Paul, MN: West, 1891), 748; “Mandamus,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

        "text": "4“6. Barr– 70.” was the legal shorthand for  volume six, page seventy of  Robert M.\n                  Barr’s,Pennsylvania State Reports, Containing Cases Adjudged in the Supreme Court, During\n                     Part of May Term, July Term, and Part of September Term, 1847.    Lincoln references the caseRailroad v. Berks County. In this case, thePennsylvania Supreme Courtruled that because water stations and depots were necessary and indispensable to\n                  the construction and preparation of railroads they were exempt from taxation,  while\n                  warehouses, coal lots and chutes, machine shops, wood yards, and the like were taxable\n                  because they were indispensable only to the railroad’s ability to generate profit.Although Lincoln does not name the other “authorities” he used in his arguments, he\n                  almost certainly also utilized the railroad’s charter, substantive legislative updates\n                  to the charter, and the general railroad incorporation law.  Enacted in 1849, the\n                  general railroad incorporation law  governed the operation of railroads, including\n                  issues of right of way. Legislation in both 1852 and 1854 amended the charter of the\n                  railroad, changing its name and allowing it to branch outward from Aurora inKane County, Illinois.Railroad v. Berks County6 Pa. (Barr) (1847), 70-75;The American Law Journal(Philadelphia: Thomas Cowperthwait and T. B. Peterson, 1849), 8:181;Century Edition of the American Digest: A Complete Digest of All Reported American\n                        Cases from the Earliest Times to 1896(St. Paul: West, 1904), 45:491-92; “An Act Granting a Charter to the Aurora Branch\n                     Railroad Company,” 12 February 1849,Private Laws of Illinois(1849),      96-99; “An Act to Provide for a General System of Railroad Incorporations,”\n                     5 November 1849,Laws of Illinois(1849),      18-33; “An Act to Amend the Charter of the Aurora Branch Railroad Company,”\n                     22 June 1852,Laws of Illinois(1852),      170-71; “An Act to Amend the Charter of the Chicago and Aurora Railroad\n                     Company,” 28 February 1854,Laws of Illinois(1854),      143."
