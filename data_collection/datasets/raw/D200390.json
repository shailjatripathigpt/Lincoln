        "text": "2At a Whig convention inPekinin May 1843, an agreement was made between Lincoln,Edward D. Baker, andJohn J. Hardinthat seemed to establish a one-term limit on the prospective Whig congressmen. Hardin\n                  and Baker having already served, Lincoln believed that the 1846 nomination should\n                  have been his. While Hardin delayed officially announcing his candidacy, Lincoln set\n                  out to solidify his own support. Lincoln and Hardin were vying to represent the Seventh\n                  Congressional District, which included the counties ofCass,Logan, Marshall,Mason,Menard,Morgan,Putnam,Sangamon,Scott,Tazewell, and Woodford.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:218, 231, 233;Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 26 February 1846, 2:1-2; Howard W.
