        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Jonas of May 27, 1857, has not been located, nor has its\n                  enclosed draft. Lincoln withdrew $40.30 from his account atSpringfield Marine & Fire Insuranceon May 28, 1857, which likely constituted a portion of the $69.30 sent by draft to\n                  Jonas.The funds related to the case of John A. Shelby, a free black man from Springfield\n                  employed on aMississippi Riverboat who had been imprisoned in New Orleans for not carrying papers to prove that\n                  he was a free person. In addition to having been contacted by Jonas concerning the\n                  case, Lincoln seems also to have been approached by Shelby’s mother, Mary (Polly)\n                  Shelby. Lincoln was acquainted with Mary Shelby as she had retained his legal services\n                  in 1841. After being arrested, John Shelby wrote a letter to his mother in care of\n                  Lincoln’s brother-in-law,William S. Wallace, requesting assistance. According to Lincoln’s law partner,William H. Herndon, after she received her son’s letter, Mary Shelby askedLincoln & Herndonto intervene on John’s behalf.In the account of the case that Herndon included in his biography of Lincoln, Herndon\n                  and Lincoln appealed unsuccessfully to the governors of bothIllinoisandLouisianato assist John Shelby. In Herndon’s telling, after a second fruitless appeal to Illinois\n                  governorWilliam H. Bissell, Lincoln stormed out, proclaiming “By God, Governor, I’ll make the ground in this\n                  country too hot for the foot of a slave, whether you have the legal power to secure\n                  the release of this boy or not.” According to Herndon, the legal partners then ceased\n                  to attempt to secure Shelby’s release as attorneys on the case, and instead Lincoln\n                  drew up a subscription list which Herndon circulated in order to raise funds by which\n                  New Orleans attorney Alexander P. Field could purchase Shelby’s freedom.Herndon asserted that Bissell claimed he had no right or power under the law to interfere\n                  in the case. However, when Springfield residents sent affidavits swearing to Shelby’s\n                  status as a free man under cover to New Orleans mayor Charles M. Waterman in February\n                  1857, the affidavits included an attestation by Bissell. In his attestation, Bissell\n                  stated: “I Certify that from facts derived from others I have entire confidence in\n                  the correctness of the within statements.”Harry E.
