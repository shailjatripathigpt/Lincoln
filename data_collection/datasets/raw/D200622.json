Henrywrote Ewing a letter on September 24, 1849, noting that although Lincoln declined\n                  the position he remained loyal to the administration. Since no one telegraphed Ewing\n                  as Lincoln had requested, EwingtelegraphedSpringfield again on September 25 asking whether Lincoln was in Springfield to respond.\n                  In aletterto Ewing dated September 27, Lincoln wrote that his friend did not telegraph Ewing\n                  as requested for fear Lincoln was declining  the position in haste. Once Lincoln learned\n                  of this, he traveled back to Springfield andtelegraphedEwing himself, declining the position.Paul I.

        "text": "4Prior to offering Lincoln appointment as governor of theOregon Territory, President Zachary Taylor’s administration had also offered Lincoln appointment as\n                  secretary of the Oregon Territory, an appointment which Lincoln also declined. Both\n                  positions were offered after Taylor appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of theU.S. General Land Office, a position Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield was favored for the\n                  job. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. As Lincoln explained in a May 16, 1849lettertoWilliam B. Preston, he believed the appointment of Butterfield to such a valuable patronage position\n                  would represent an affront toWhigsofIllinoiswho had worked so hard to get Taylor nominated andelected president. Many Illinois Whigs were indeed upset by Butterfield’s appointment and criticized\n                  both  Taylor and Ewing. The administration hoped that by offering Lincoln a political\n                  appointment in the Oregon Territory, it would appease any angry Illinois Whigs and\n                  prevent additional attacks upon Butterfield’s appointment. But after serious consideration\n                  of the Oregon governorship offer, Lincoln also declined this position, at least in\n                  part becauseMary Lincolnhad no desire to live in such a remote location. Taylor appointedJohn P. GainesofVirginiagovernor of the Oregon Territory instead.Appointment of Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Territory of Oregon; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:306-7;Register of all Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of\n                        the United States, on the Thirtieth September, 1849(Washington, DC: Gideon, 1849), 250."
