        "text": "4Lincoln’s June 16 address was the acceptance speech that he delivered at the1858 Illinois Republican Convention. In this address, which became known as the “House Divided” speech, Lincoln accepted\n                  the Illinois Republican Party’s nomination for the U.S. Senate. Lincoln also gave\n                  a campaign speech in Springfield, Illinois on July 17. TheDaily Illinois State Journalprinted Lincoln’s June 16 speech in its June 18 issue and printed his July 17 speech\n                  in its July 20 issue.  Lincoln also had his July 17 speech published in pamphlet form\n                  for distribution.Lincoln and Eccles corresponded at least twice more during theelection of 1858. Lincoln also traveled to Hillsboro on September 8, stayed at Eccles’ home, and delivered\n                  a campaign speech on September 9.At the time, members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; hence, the\n                  outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewould decide the senatorial contest. In the local elections of 1858, Republicans\n                  won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, but pro-Douglas Democrats retained control\n                  of the General Assembly. Lincoln ultimately received forty-six votes in the General\n                  Assembly, and Douglas received fifty-one votes and retained the U.S. Senate seat.\n                  Through the campaign, however, and in particular through his participation in the\n                  Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the\n                  national Republican Party.Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Fragment of A House Divided Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois; Report of Speech at Springfield, Illinois;Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 18 June 1858, 2:2-4; 20 July 1858, 2:1-6;Abraham Lincoln to Gustave P.
