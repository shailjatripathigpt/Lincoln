        "text": "2WalkerwroteLincoln another letter on August 2. In this letter, he noted that Lincoln had replied\n                  to this July 23 letter on July 30. However, Lincoln’s July 30 letter to Walker has\n                  not been located.At the time of this letter, Lincoln was theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace Democratic incumbent Stephen A. Douglas in\n                  theU.S. Senate. See the1858 Illinois Republican Convention.  Douglas indeed delivered a campaign speech in Havana, Illinois on August 13; Lincoln\n                  delivered an address the next day. For the first part of theelection campaign of 1858Lincoln often followed Douglas on the  trail, delivering speeches either later in\n                  the evening after Douglas finished, or the next day. On July 24, however, Lincoln\n                  challenged Douglas to a series of formal debates. In an August 2letterto Joseph Eccles, Lincoln noted that he believed one of Douglas’ replies indicated\n                  that “my presence, on the days or evenings of his meetings would be considered an\n                  intrusion.” This is most likely why Lincoln addressed Havana the day after Douglas’\n                  address rather than on the same day, as Walker suggests above. Douglas eventually\n                  agreed to debate Lincoln, resulting in the famousLincoln-Douglas Debates.The Illinois press published copies of as well as reports on many of the speeches\n                  Lincoln delivered while on the campaign trail.At the time, members of theIllinois General Assemblyvoted for and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; hence, the\n                  outcome of races for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewould decide the senatorial contest.  In the local elections of 1858, Republicans\n                  won a majority of all votes cast in Illinois, yet pro-Douglas Democrats retained control\n                  of the General Assembly and Douglas ultimately won reelection. Through the campaign,\n                  however, and in particular through his participation in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,\n                  Lincoln gained recognition as well as standing within the national Republican Party.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458, 483-85, 556-57;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 13 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-13; 14 August 1858,https://thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1858-08-14; Allen C.
