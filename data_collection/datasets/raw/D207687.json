        "text": "2A mandamus is a writ by which a court exercises its authority over a public official\n                  and compels them to perform an official duty. In this instance, the official wasIllinoisSecretary of StateOzias M. Hatch, who was being sued in theIllinois Supreme Courtfor a writ of mandamus to furnish state printers Lanphier & Walker of theDemocraticIllinois State Registerwith a true copy of an 1857 bill apportioning representation in theIllinois General Assembly. The bill had been drafted and supported by the Democrats with an eye towards maintaining\n                  their party’s majority in the General Assembly. TheIllinois House of Representativespassed the bill on February 16, 1857, and theIllinois Senateconcurred on February 18.RepublicanGovernorWilliam H. Bissellmistakenly signed the bill then cancelled his signature after his secretary had already\n                  reported his approval to the House. John A. McClernand was one of the Democratic attorneys\n                  representing the plaintiffs, while Hatch retained Lincoln,Orville H. Browning, andJackson Grimshaw. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in Hatch’s favor in February 1858 and denied the\n                  writ.On this date Lincolnwrotea similar letter toJoseph Gillespierequesting his consultation on the case and alsotelegraphedGeorge T. BrowninAltontelling him to send Gillespie to Springfield immediately. Neither Gillespie nor Koerner\n                  was an attorney of record on the case.“Mandamus,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
