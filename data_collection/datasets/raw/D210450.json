Shaw, and others were vying to become postmaster of Tremont, Illinois.\n                  Stockwell and Roberts were the original frontrunners for the job.  Lincoln recommended\n                  one of the two to thePost Office Department, but then he began receiving letters opposing both Stockwell and Roberts and supporting\n                  Ball as an alternative.  With Tremonters at odds over which candidate they preferred,\n                  Lincoln was forced to write the Post Office Department and ask that if the appointment\n                  was not already made, to suspend it until the town could unify around one candidate.\n                  On April 21, LincolnwroteBriggs offering advice on how to handle the vexing problem.  Lincoln advised Briggs\n                  “to get up a full and fair meeting” of the Whigs and, if he thought fit,Democratsof the area to decide who would become postmaster.  This meeting occurred on April\n                  28, and Roberts received the majority of support.Lincoln himself preferred Roberts and recommended him for the position.  Roberts received\n                  the appointment in May 1849 and held the job until 1860.Petition of Richard T. Gill and Others to Abraham Lincoln;Mary L.
