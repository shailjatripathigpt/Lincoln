        "text": "5TheIllinois State Journalreported that at this time Bissell was planning speaking engagements for every county\n                  in southern Illinois. Despite Bissell’s advice, Lincoln conducted most of his stumping\n                  in central Illinois in September and October, with the exception of September speeches\n                  inOlneyand possiblyLawrenceville, and the October speech in Belleville.Bissell ultimately earned 47 percent of the vote in the 1856 Illinois gubernatorial\n                  election, beatingDemocratWilliam A. Richardson, who garnered 45 percent of the vote, andAmerican PartycandidateBuckner S. Morris, who received 8 percent, and thus became the first Republican governor of Illinois.Despite his campaign efforts in southern Illinois, Bissell performed much better in\n                  the northern than the southern counties of the state. Out of the twenty-eight counties\n                  in the First, Second, and Third Congressional Districts which encompassed the northernmost\n                  portions of Illinois, Bissell received a majority of the vote in every county exceptDeWittandMcLean, and in many northern Illinois counties, his margin of victory was significant. By\n                  contrast, out of the twenty-seven counties in the southernmost Eighth and Ninth Illinois\n                  Congressional Districts, Bissell received the highest number of votes in only four\n                  counties, placed second in seven, and came in last in sixteen.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 16 August 1856, 2:1;The Lincoln Log: A Daily Chronology of the Life of Abraham Lincoln, 19 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-19; 20 September 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-09-20; 18 October 1856,http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1856-10-18; Robert P.

In Illinois, he won 44.1\n                  percent of the total vote to Fremont’s 40.2 percent and American Party candidate Millard\n                  Fillmore’s 15.7 percent. Voters in southern Illinois overwhelmingly cast their ballots\n                  for Buchanan, but Fillmore did indeed outperform Fremont in the region. Out of the\n                  twenty-seven counties in the Eighth and Ninth Congressional Districts of southernmost\n                  Illinois, Buchanan earned the most votes in twenty-two, with Fillmore garnering the\n                  second highest number in the majority of those counties. Fillmore himself won the\n                  most votes in four of these counties, while Fremont received the highest number of\n                  votes only inSt. Clair County, Bissell’s home county.Howard W.
