        "text": "3Bell was referencing a movement among conservative Whigs inNew York Cityto launch an independent candidacy forHenry Clayfor president in opposition toZachary Taylor, who won the Whig nomination at the national convention in June 1848.  In the lead\n                  up to thepresidential election of 1848, Taylor initially insisted on an independent candidacy separate from party, but his\n                  advisors convinced him that a public declaration of Whig principles was necessary\n                  for him to secure that party’s nomination. Taylor issued this declaration on April\n                  22 in a letter addressed to John S. Allison, aKentuckytobacco factor who was visiting him at the time. The Allison Letter included Taylor’s\n                  declaration, “I am a Whig, but not an Ultra Whig,” reiterating his intention to act\n                  above party. The letter had the desired effect of convincing doubters that Taylor\n                  was a Whig. \n                  Anti-slavery and some regular Whigs, however, condemned the nomination of Taylor,\n                  a southern slaveholder who had no previous political affiliation, as an abandonment\n                  of Whig principles. As an act of protest, Clay and many others refused to endorse\n                  Taylor and participate in the campaign.  Accusations that Taylor was not a Whig plagued\n                  his campaign, and Abraham Lincoln and other Taylorite Whigs, led byJohn J. Crittenden, spent the summer working to convince party faithful and neutrals of the general’s\n                  Whig bona fides.      \n                  Taylor undermined these efforts, however,  in  letters to George Lippard andSouth CarolinaWhigs reasserting his independence from party.  To make matters worse, in another\n                  letter to South Carolina Whigs published in theCharleston News, he affirmed he would have just as readily accepted the nomination from the Democrats\n                  had the party made him its nominee.  Outraged by the South Carolina letters, conservative\n                  Whigs, at a mass meeting in New York City on September 7, pledged support for a new\n                  ticket of Clay andMillard Fillmore.  The New York City insurgency fizzled; Clay refused to lead a rebellion against\n                  his own party, and declined the nomination.  The abortive insurgency did not have\n                  an adverse impact on Taylor’s cause in New York; he won the state and its vital thirty-six\n                  electoral votes with 47.9 percent of the popular vote, to 25.1 percent for Democratic\n                  candidateLewis Cassand 26.4 percent forMartin Van Buren, candidate of the nascentFree Soil Party.Michael F.
