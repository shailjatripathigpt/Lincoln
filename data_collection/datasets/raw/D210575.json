He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats.Abraham Lincoln to Charles Hoyt;Abraham Lincoln to J.

        "text": "4Party control of the Illinois House of Representatives andSenateafter the 1854 election was significant because the General Assembly was responsible\n                  for selecting the state’s U.S. senators. The result of the election was an anti-Nebraska\n                  majority in the Illinois General Assembly, which was promising for Lincoln’s potential\n                  candidacy. Lincoln himself won election to the Illinois House of Representatives in\n                  the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.The General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855 to make their selection\n                  for the U.S. Senate.  All of the state senators and representatives listed by Washburne\n                  from the counties of Northern Illinois voted for Lincoln in the first two rounds of\n                  voting. In subsequent rounds, some switched their votes toMartin P. Sweet,William B. Ogden, orLyman Trumbull. Only Daniel J. Pinckney and Hurlbut Swan continued to support Lincoln through all\n                  of the first nine rounds of voting. For the tenth vote, Lincoln withdrew and urged\n                  his supporters to vote for Trumbull in order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician\n                  filled the seat. All those named here voted for Trumbull in the tenth and final round\n                  of voting in which he emerged victorious.
