Besides the manifest injustice of this regulation,\n               your petitioners represent that many thousands of children and youth are deter^r^ed from subscribing to these useful papers solely by the comparitively excessive postage chargeable on the small sheets they desire to obtain. A reduction, therefore, of postage, in favor of juvenile newspapers of small dementions, would tend greatley to diffuse knowledge and piety, the bulwarkes of our national prosperityFor an immedeate and proportionate reduction of postage, tharefore, on all newspapers not containing more than 500 squaire inches, your petitioners respectfuley and urgentley pray.",

Lincoln presented this petition in the House\n                  of Representatives on February 18, 1848, and the House referred it to the Committee\n                  on the Post Office and Post Roads, of which Lincoln was a member. From December 1847\n                  through February 1849, over 200 petitions using nearly identical language were presented\n                  by various members of the House of Representatives.
