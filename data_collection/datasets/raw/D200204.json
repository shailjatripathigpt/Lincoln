        "text": "2Section twenty-six of the 1829 law governing elections stipulated congressional elections\n                  would occur on the first Monday in August 1831, and on the first Monday in August\n                  1832, and on the first Monday in August biennially thereafter. Under provisions of\n                  section twenty-six, elections had occurred in 1834, 1836, 1838, and were scheduled\n                  for August 1840.  In January 1839, theGeneral Assemblyenacted, and theCouncil of Revisionapproved, anactstipulating that  on the first Monday of August, 1841, and on the first Monday of\n                  August every second year thereafter, there was to be held an election for theHouse of Representatives.  This act explicitly repealed section twenty-six of the 1829 law.  The text of the\n                  bill Lincoln references, entitled “A Bill in Relation to the Election of Members ofCongress,” is not extant, but presumably it would have repealed the January 1839 act and reinstated\n                  section twenty-six. \n                  The Illinois House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 45 yeas to 39 nays,\n                  with Lincoln voting nay, but the Illinois Senate indefinitely postponed further consideration\n                  on January 30, and the bill never became law.“An Act Regulating Elections,” 10 January 1829,Revised Laws of Illinois(1829), 67;Abraham Lincoln to John T.
