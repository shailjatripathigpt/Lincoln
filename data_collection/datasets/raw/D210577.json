        "text": "4Johns references Lincoln’s candidacy for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Lincoln wrote\n                  multiple letters to political allies  in November and December of 1854, seeking support\n                  for his candidacy and information about his prospects.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into the election\n                  campaign in the fall of 1854, crisscrossing Illinois to deliver speeches against the\n                  Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska candidates.  He even allowed himself\n                  to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s  U.S. Senate\n                  seats.The state’s voters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  in which Lincoln also won a seat. However, in late-November 1854, he declined to serve\n                  in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Ultimately, Lincoln  did not win election to\n                  the U.S. Senate; the Illinois General Assembly selected anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullinstead. Johns cast his vote for Lincoln on nine ballots before switching to Trumbull\n                  in the final ballot.
