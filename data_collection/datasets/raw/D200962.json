        "text": "3Lincoln is discussing the case ofBacon v. Ohio & Mississippi RR. The Ohio &  Mississippi Railroad Company had received funds from the banking firm\n                  of Page & Bacon with which to finance  construction of the railroad inIllinois. The railroad’s board agreed in February 1856 to pay Page & Bacon $312,133.35 to\n                  settle the debt, and gave the firm a cognovit note  dated February 28, 1856, for that\n                  amount.  A cognovit note is  a type of promissory note that simplifies the collection\n                  of debts through the courts, as the  debtor instructs an attorney to confess judgment\n                  against them if they fail to pay the note. Lincoln was the attorney so instructed\n                  in the note given by the Ohio & Mississippi Railroad to Page & Bacon, and which the\n                  banking firm assigned toHenry D.  Bacon. After the railroad failed to pay, Lincoln exercised the authority given to him in\n                  the cognovit note and filed suit against the railroad on Bacon’s behalf in theU.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Lincoln wrote the declaration laying out Bacon’s case, but signedWilliam H. Herndon’s name to it as the attorney of record for Bacon. As attorney representing  the railroad,\n                  Lincoln then confessed judgment for $312,133.35 for the debt and $256.54 in damages,\n                  and the court allowed the confession.Koerner was not a participant inBacon v. Ohio & Mississippi RR, but was an attorney for the plaintiffs in the ongoing case ofClark & Morrison v. Page et al., which also concerned the firm of Page & Bacon and the Ohio & Mississippi Railroad.Clark & Morrison v. Page et al.arose out of a dispute between stockholders of the railroad and officers of the firm\n                  of Page & Bacon who were also on the board of the railroad. After the Page & Bacon\n                  officers took possession of the railroad and advertised it for sale in the summer\n                  of 1855, the stockholders,Henry A. ClarkandJames L. D. Morrison, filed suit seeking a receiver to manage the railroad’s business and an injunction\n                  to prevent its sale. When the case was first heard in Macoupin County Circuit Court\n                  in September 1855 Lincoln was also involved, as an attorney for the defendants. As\n                  of the date of this letter to Koerner, the case had been continued multiple times,\n                  including most recently in May 1857. By the time the case finally concluded in favor\n                  of the plaintiffs in December 1859, Lincoln had ceased to be involved. Lincoln hadwrittento Koerner regarding their respective fees inClark & Morrison v. Page et al.in 1856, but no further correspondence between the two regarding the case has been\n                  located.Bacon v. Ohio & Mississippi RR, Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis et al., eds.,The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition, 2d edition (Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 2009),https://lawpracticeofabrahamlincoln.org/Details.aspx?case=137508; “Cognovit Note,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.

        "text": "4A quo warranto is a writ issued to halt the exercise of an unlawfully-held office.\n                  The phrase translates literally as “by what authority”, and such a writ orders a sheriff\n                  to summon the individual  before the court to demonstrate under what authority their\n                  occupation of an office is legitimate.The quo warranto case Lincoln refers to which was pending in Sangamon County Circuit\n                  Court wasPeople ex rel. Koerner et al. v. Ridgely et al.In 1848, GovernorAugustus C. Frenchhad appointedNicholas H. Ridgely,Uri Manley, andJohn Calhounas trustees of the remaining assets of the liquidatedState Bank of Illinois. GovernorWilliam H. Bissellsubsequently removed the men from the position of trustees in 1857 and appointed\n                  Koerner,George T. Brown, andRichard Yatesin their stead. Ridgely, Manley, and Calhoun, however, refused to relinquish their\n                  positions, and the state of Illinois, in the interest of Bissell’s appointees, retained\n                  Lincoln and Herndon to sue in an action of quo warranto to remove them. The case was\n                  called in Sangamon County Circuit Court on August 11, 1857, and continued. Lincolnwroteagain to Koerner later in 1857 requesting permission to delay the case until a subsequent\n                  Illinois Supreme Court term. The case was decided in Sangamon County Circuit Court\n                  on November 15, 1858, in favor of the defendants. The case was appealed to theIllinois Supreme Courtwhere it was heard on January 24, 1859. The Supreme Court upheld the lower court’s\n                  decision, with JusticeSidney Breeseruling that the trusteeships were not technically offices and thus could not be subject\n                  to a quo warranto action.“Quo Warranto,” Reference, Glossary, Martha L.
