        "text": "2In aletterof April 19, 1858 to Lincoln, John Wentworth conveyed a rumor that one of the Republican\n                  members of theU.S. CongressfromIllinoishad written a letter encouraging Illinois Republicans to supportStephen A. Douglas’ bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein 1858. Abraham LincolnwroteWashburne regarding the rumor on April 26, excerpting a portion of Wentworth’s letter,\n                  and assuring Washburne that although suspicion centered on him, Lincoln was confident\n                  the matter was a misunderstanding.The letter in controversy was one written by Washburne toCharles L. Wilsonon April 12, 1858. Washburne retrieved the letter from Wilson and enclosed the manuscript\n                  original here for Lincoln’s edification. Washburnerequestedits return in a subsequent letter, stating that he anticipated needing to show it\n                  to others as proof of his innocence in the matter. Lincolnreturnedthe letter, and Washburne eventually gave it back to Wilson.  The manuscript original\n                  of the letter has not been located, but it was subsequently published in thePolo Advertiserin 1860.In this letter to Wilson, Washburne expressed his confusion over the current state\n                  of politics in Illinois in light of the rift in theDemocratic Partybetween supporters of Douglas and supporters of PresidentJames Buchanan, which was  caused by Douglas’ criticism of theLecompton Constitutionand of the president’s support of it. Washburne stated that despite his dislike of\n                  Douglas, he would welcome him as an ally to the Republican Party, but expressed concern\n                  over whether there was a movement to create a Douglas party in Illinois and an attempt\n                  to reelect Douglas. Republicans should not abandon their platform, wrote Washburne,\n                  and their candidate for U.S. Senate in theelection of 1858must be Lincoln.Russell K.
