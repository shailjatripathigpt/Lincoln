Abraham Lincoln entered the competition after learning that Butterfield was favored\n                  over Morrison and Edwards. See theGeneral Land Office Affair. In early June 1849, Lincoln sent a series of letters to numerous people requesting\n                  letters in support of his candidacy for commissioner. Presumably, Lincoln made a similar\n                  request of Ryan, although no such letter has been located.Abraham Lincoln to Josiah B. Herrick;Abraham Lincoln to James M.
