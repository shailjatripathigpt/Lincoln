        "text": "3Lincoln and Washburne had exchanged several letters on the subject of Washburne’s\n                  letter to Charles L. Wilson of April 12, 1858, which Washburne mentions here. In aletterof April 19, 1858 to Lincoln,John Wentworthhad conveyed a report that one of the Republican members of theU.S. CongressfromIllinoishad written a letter encouraging Illinois Republicans to support Stephen A. Douglas’\n                  bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein theelection of 1858. This rumor circulated among Illinois Republicans, including at a meeting of party\n                  leaders in Springfield on April 21 at which Lincoln was present. LincolnwroteWashburne regarding the rumor on April 26, assuring Washburne that although suspicion\n                  centered on him, Lincoln was confident the matter was a misunderstanding. Washburnerespondedon May 2, denying the rumor, thenwroteagain on May 6, enclosing the letter in controversy for Lincoln to peruse himself.The manuscript original of Washburne’s April 12, 1858 letter to Wilson has not been\n                  located, but it was subsequently published in thePolo Advertiserin 1860. In this letter, Washburne discussed his confusion over the current state\n                  of politics in Illinois in light of the rift in the Democratic Party between supporters\n                  of Douglas and supporters of PresidentJames Buchanan, which was caused by Douglas’ criticism of theLecompton Constitutionand of the president’s support of it. Washburne stated that despite his dislike of\n                  Douglas, he would welcome him as an ally to the Republican Party, but expressed concern\n                  over whether there was a movement to create a Douglas party in Illinois and an attempt\n                  to reelect Douglas. Republicans should not abandon their platform, wrote Washburne,\n                  and their candidate for U.S. Senate in the election of 1858 must be Lincoln.Russell K.

        "text": "4Washburne is apparently expressing his belief that rather than a permanent break over\n                  the Lecompton Constitution pushing Douglas Democrats to ally with Republicans in Illinois,\n                  the Douglas Democrats in the state would ultimately reconcile with the  Buchanan Democrats\n                  and oppose the Republican Party jointly.As evidence of this, Washburne points to the recent election of a new doorkeeper in\n                  theU.S. House of Representatives, when the two factions of the Democratic Party united to elect a Democratic candidate.\n                  The incumbent doorkeeper, Robert B. Hackney, was accused of corruption and dismissed\n                  from office on May 17, 1858. That same evening, House Democrats met in caucus to chose\n                  their nominee to replace Hackney.Joseph L. Wrightwon a majority of votes on the third ballot of the Democratic caucus, after which\n                  his nomination was made unanimous. Wright  was described variously as a Lecompton\n                  or administration Democrat. Despite this designation, Douglas Democrats also supported\n                  him and Wright was elected  doorkeeper on May 18, receiving 117 out of 216 votes in\n                  a contest that largely followed Democratic and Republican party lines. Among the Illinois\n                  members of the U.S. House of Representatives, DemocratsIsaac N. Morris,Aaron Shaw,Robert Smith, andSamuel S. Marshallall voted for Wright. The sole remaining Illinois Democratic Representative, Thomas\n                  L. Harris, cast the single vote in the U.S. House of Representatives for Peter Gorman,\n                  a Douglas Democrat who had been considered in the Democratic caucus of the preceding\n                  evening, but who lost the party’s nomination to Wright. Illinois’ Republican members\n                  of the House, Washburne,John F. Farnsworth,Owen Lovejoy, andWilliam Kelloggall voted for Republican candidate Arthur W.
