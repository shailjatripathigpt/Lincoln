        "text": "3The case ofMorrison v. Briggswas brought on July 5, 1854  in United States Circuit Court for the District of Illinois\n                  by plaintiff William M. Morrison, represented by attorneysCharles B. LawrenceandArchibald Williams. Morrison claimed that he was the owner of a 320-acre tract of land inRandolph Countywhich he argued that defendant Charles Briggs was unlawfully occupying. Lincoln andStephen T. Loganrepresented Briggs, and on July 15, 1854, Lincoln filed a plea of not guilty on Briggs’s\n                  behalf. The case went to court on December 20, 1854, and a jury found in favor of\n                  Morrison, awarding him damages of one cent and the cost of his legal fees, and ordering\n                  Briggs to give up possession of the land. Between instituting this case in July of\n                  1854 and its conclusion in December of the same year, Morrison filed a deed in Randolph\n                  County on September 18, 1854 which documented his purchase of the tract under contention\n                  on December 20, 1853 from his cousinJames L. D. Morrisonand the latter’s wife, Mary A. Carlin Morrison.Morrison v. Briggs, Martha L.
