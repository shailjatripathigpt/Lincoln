An unknown plaintiff sued unknown defendants in an action of ejectment\n                  to remove them from some real property.  The defendants retained Lincoln.  The plaintiff\n                  proved that the deed on which the defendants relied had been forged.  The court ruled\n                  for the plaintiff.
