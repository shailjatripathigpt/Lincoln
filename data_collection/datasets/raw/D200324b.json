Sangamon County was in the third district,\n                  which was composed roughly of the counties in the northern third of the state. Following\n                  the 1840 census, Congress increased Illinois’ number of congressional districts to\n                  seven. On March 1, 1843, the General Assembly passed a law creating new districts.\n                  The seventh district was composed of Sangamon and ten other west-central Illinois\n                  counties.“An Act to Lay out the State into Districts, for the Purpose of Electing Representatives\n                     to the Congress of the United States,” 15 February 1831,Laws of Illinois(1831), 70-71; “An Act for the Apportionment of Representatives among the Several\n                     States according to the Sixth Census,” 25 June 1842,Statutes at Large of the United States5 (1856):491; “An Act to Establish Seven Congressional Districts,” 1 March 1843,Laws of Illinois(1843), 71-72."
