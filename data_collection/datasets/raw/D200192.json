        "text": "6In old English law, members of the clergy were exempt from the punishment of death.\n                  With this reference, Lincoln used sarcasm to report that the legislature had allowed\n                  the State Bank of Illinois’s charter to die. Section twenty-five of the bank’sincorporation actstipulated that if the bank refused or neglected to redeem, for ten days after demand,\n                  its notes or evidence of debt in specie, the bank would discontinue operations and\n                  its charter would be forfeited.  Anact supplementaryto the incorporation act gave the bill an additional fifty days to suspend specie\n                  payments. In May 1837, the bank suspended specie payments in response to thePanic of 1837.  In July, a special session of the legislature commenced to deal with the banking\n                  crisis.  On July 21, the General Assembly passed anactsuspending until the end of the next general or special session of the legislature\n                  provisions of the law requiring the bank to forfeit its charter for refusing to redeem\n                  its notes in specie for sixty days.  In December 1839, the state’s debt crisis forced\n                  the bank to again suspend specie payments.  GovernorThomas Carlincalled the legislature into special session to deal with the crisis.  In hismessageto the General Assembly,  Carlin attacked the bank and demanded an investigation\n                  of its affairs.  The legislators complied by establishing a joint select committee.\n                  Despite Carlin’s hostility andLincoln’s skepticism, the legislature  passed anacton January 31, 1840, resuscitating the bank with, as Lincoln described in alettertoStuart, “some trifling modifications.”  The act revived the bank’s charter and suspending\n                  stipulations on specie payments until the end of the next legislative session.John Bouvier, ed.,A Law Dictionary Adapted to the Constitution of the Laws of the United States of America, 6th ed., (Philadelphia: Childs & Peterson, 1856), 165; Illinois HouseJournal. 1839. 11th G.
