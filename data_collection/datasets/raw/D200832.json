Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. In November and December 1854, he wrote confidential letters to political\n                  allies, seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.The state’s voters sent an anti-Nebraska majority to the Illinois General Assembly,\n                  which improved Lincoln’s chances in the senatorial election.  Lincoln also won a seat\n                  in the Illinois House of Representatives, but in late-November 1854, hedeclinedto serve in order to run for the U.S. Senate.When the General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to elect a\n                  U.S. senator, ten rounds of voting were needed to finally determine a victor. Lincoln\n                  received a majority of the anti-Nebraska votes until the tenth and final ballot, when\n                  he withdrew and urged his supporters to vote for anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullin order to ensure that an anti-Nebraska politician filled the seat. With the votes\n                  of Lincoln’s supporters, Trumbull won the seat. See1854 Federal Election.Louis L.
