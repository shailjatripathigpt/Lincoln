        "text": "3PresidentZachary Taylor‘s administration received heavy criticism for its handling of political patronage\n                  appointments, particularly after theDemocratic Partywon numerous elections in 1849. Prior to theelection of 1848, Taylor promised to reward all who supported him equally once he became president,\n                  irrespective of their political affiliation. Following its victory in the election\n                  of 1848, the Taylor administration employed the so-called “Virginia policy” with regard\n                  to political appointments.  Taylor hoped that by allowing several of PresidentJames K. Polk’s last-minute Democratic appointments to stand,  and by appointing Democrats himself,\n                  he would gain Democratic support forWhigcandidates–or at least not raise the ire of Democratic voters. His administration\n                  paid particular attention to Virginia’s Democrats. Four Democrats fromVirginiawere appointed to new terms, Virginia was permitted to keep its Democratic postmasters,\n                  custom collectors, U.S. marshals, and U.S. attorneys, and more than sixty Democratic\n                  Virginian clerks in Washington, DC were permitted to keep their jobs. Many Whigs were\n                  upset and demoralized not only by Taylor’s Virginia policy, but also by what they\n                  perceived as Taylor’s passivity with regard to patronage appointments.Taylor was criticized for delegating most decisions on patronage appointments either\n                  to members of his cabinet or to the departments under which the appointments fell.\n                  In July 1849, LincolnwroteSecretary of StateJohn M. Clayton, asking him to speak with the president on the topic and impress upon him the importance\n                  of accepting personal responsibility for political appointments, lest he “damn us\n                  all inevitably.” Although the perception that Taylor was uninvolved in the selection\n                  process for patronage appointments was popular at the time, it was inaccurate. Taylor\n                  indeed delegated authority to his cabinet to make decisions on most appointments.\n                  But he also attended most cabinet meetings where appointments were discussed, personally\n                  oversaw major diplomatic appointments and choice federal appointments inNew York City, overrode Clayton when he disagreed with his selections, and awarded some of the\n                  best patronage positions to his political allies, friends, and family members. Nevertheless,\n                  many saw Taylor’s delegation of decisions on patronage appointments as a sign of weak\n                  leadership as well as a betrayal of his campaign promise to represent and fight for\n                  the interests of the people.Michael F. Holt,The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of\n                        the Civil War(New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 418-19, 422-24."

        "text": "5In aletterto Lincoln on June 23, 1849, Lucas wrote that he was concerned about losing his position\n                  as a temporary clerk in the U.S. General Land Office after President Taylor appointedJustin H. Butterfieldcommissioner of the Office, a job Lincoln had sought after learning that Butterfield\n                  was favored over the other two candidates for the job (Morrison andCyrus Edwards). See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Since Lucas had urged Lincoln to join the competition for the position, he had worried\n                  that Butterfield might not retain him as a clerk. After Butterfield was appointed,\n                  Lucas asked Lincoln to appeal to both Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing and Butterfield\n                  on the matter of securing a permanent position for Lucas. Although no letter from\n                  Lincoln to Ewing on the topic of Lucas’ position has been located, in a July 1849letterto John Addison, Lincoln wrote that he was glad Lucas had a “good understanding with\n                  the new Commissioner.” Nevertheless, Lucas’ name does not appear in the official register\n                  of the officers and agents of the government employed as of September 30, 1849, nor\n                  does it appear in the official register for 1851. His name is listed, however, in\n                  the official registers for 1853, 1855,  and 1857 as a clerk in the U.S. General Land\n                  Office.Abraham Lincoln to George W.

        "text": "6Supporters of each candidate for commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office sent\n                  letters of reference and recommendation to both President Taylor and Ewing. Although\n                  theDepartment of the Interioroversaw the U.S. General Land Office, Taylor was ultimately responsible for appointing\n                  the commissioner of the Office.LincolnwroteEwing June 22, 1849, requesting that all letters of recommendation and reference\n                  filed with the Department of the Interior pertaining to his candidacy for commissioner\n                  of the U.S. General Land Office be returned to him. Ewing complied, returning all\n                  but three of the letters from Lincoln’s file. Lincoln suspected that  two particular\n                  letters which were missing from his file and not returned to him–one fromRichard W. Thompsonand one fromElisha Embree–were purposefully omitted by someone at the Department of the Interior in order to\n                  give Butterfield an advantage over him in the competition for the job. Ewing, however,\n                  insisted that Taylor had seen both Thompson’s and Embree’s letters, after which they\n                  were then forwarded to him and retained due to departmental policy which did not permit\n                  the return of any letters of reference or recommendation which were addressed to Taylor\n                  or which contained statements about anyone other than the person being recommended.\n                  Lincoln laterwroteAddison that his loyalty to both Taylor and “the great whig cause” induced him to\n                  remain silent about his suspicions. Thompson’s and Embree’s letters of recommendation\n                  have not been located.Eventually, on April 22, 1850, the Democrat-controlledU.S. House of Representativesformed a committee underWilliam A. Richardsonto investigate Ewing’s role in and handling of patronage appointments as well as\n                  his management of pension payments and Department of the Interior accounts. On June\n                  8, 1850, theNew York Heraldreported that Butterfield’s appointment as commissioner of the U.S. General Land\n                  Office was one patronage appointment that the Richardson Committee was investigating,\n                  particularly with regard to letters missing from the file on Lincoln that was shown\n                  to President Taylor prior to Taylor selecting the final appointee. However, when the\n                  committee filed its final reports on September 4-7, 1850, it made no finding regarding\n                  Butterfield’s appointment. The Whig-controlledU.S. Senatealso exonerated Ewing of all charges, although suspicions remained in some Whig circles\n                  that Ewing had indeed suppressed letters of recommendation from Lincoln’s  file.Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Cong.
