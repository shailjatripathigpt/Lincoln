Douglasto represent Illinois in theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln and Douglas both campaigned extensively\n                  and focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.Daily Illinois State Journal(Springfield), 17 June 1858, 2:1-6; Allen C.

        "text": "4The concept of constructive treason originated in the English legal tradition, where\n                  it was a capital offense. As opposed to treasonous actions such as levying war against\n                  the state, constructive treason encompassed spoken and written criticism of the government.\n                  Article III, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution defines treason as levying war against\n                  the country or joining or otherwise giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the country,\n                  with the framers intending to prevent the concept of constructive treason from being\n                  invoked to suppress political dissent.Despite not being explicitly defined in the U.S. Constitution, constructive treason\n                  was a political issue during the period ofBleeding Kansas. In Kansas’ first election of a territorial legislature in 1855, a pro-slavery government\n                  was elected in a election characterized by widespread fraud, and a rival  anti-slavery\n                  legislature was subsequently formed in response. In January of 1856 PresidentFranklin Piercemade a statement that declared the pro-slavery legislature legitimate despite the\n                  election irregularities, and characterized opposition to the territorial government\n                  as treason. The following May the territorial court called for the indictment on treason\n                  charges of several men who let the opposition to the pro-slavery territorial government.\n                  Territorial supreme court chief justiceSamuel D. Lecomptewas inaccurately reported as having requested that a grand jury charge the men with\n                  constructive treason, for which he was criticized widely by politicians and in the\n                  press. Those of the men charged with treason who were captured were imprisoned for\n                  several months before the government declined to further pursue the charges.William A. Blair,With Malice toward Some: Treason and Loyalty in the Civil War Era(Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2014), 15-16, 24-30; U.S. Const.\n                     art.

Patterson may have confused the cognomen\n                  of “Africanus”, which was granted to Scipio in recognition of his victory in North\n                  Africa, as an indication that Scipio was in fact African. Republicans in this period\n                  referred to members of the Democratic Party as “Black” or “African” Democrats, alternately\n                  to highlight that party’s commitment to the expansion of slavery and to imply that\n                  the Democratic and not the Republican Party favored the interests of black people\n                  over those of white people.Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, eds.,The Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed. rev.
