Morrison, andCyrus Edwardswere vying to become commissioner. Lincoln entered the competition after learning\n                  that Butterfield was favored over Morrison and Edwards. In June 1849, PresidentZachary Taylorappointed Butterfield to the position. See theGeneral Land Office Affair.Immediately following Butterfield’s appointment, LincolnwroteSecretary of the InteriorThomas Ewingand requested that all letters of recommendation and reference filed with theU.S. Department of the Interiorpertaining to his candidacy for the position be returned to him. Ewing complied,\n                  returning all but three of the letters from Lincoln’s file. Berdan’s letter of recommendation,\n                  however, has not been located.Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Thomas Ewing to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing."
