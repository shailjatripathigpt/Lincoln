Edwards and Abraham Lincoln to the Editor of the Sangamo Journal, 25 June\n               18411 It having been charged in some of the public prints, thatHarry Wilton, late United States Marshal for the District ofIllinois, had used his office for political effect, in the appointment of Deputies for the\n               taking of the census for the year 1840, we, the undersigned, were called upon by Mr.\n               Wilton to examine the papers in his possession relative to these appointments, and\n               to ascertain therefrom the correctness or incorrectness of such charge.2We accompanied Mr. Wilton to a room, and examined the matter as fully as we could\n               with the means afforded us.  The only sources of information, bearing on the subject,\n               which were submitted to us, were theletters, &c.[etc.] recommending and opposing the various appointments made, and Mr. Wilton’sverbal statementsconcerning the same.  From these letters, &c., it appears that in some instances\n               appointments were made in accordance with the recommendations of leadingwhigs, and in opposition to those of leadingdemocrats; among which instances, the appointments inScott,Wayne,MadisonandLawrenceare the strongest.  According to Mr. Wilton’s statement, of the 76 appointments we\n               examined, 54 were of democrats, 11 of whigs, and 11 of unknown politics. The chief ground of complaint against Mr. Wilton, as we had understood it, was because\n               of his appointment of so many democratic candidates for thelegislature;  thus giving them a decided advantage over their whig opponents—and consequently\n               our attention was directed rather particularly to that point.  We found that there\n               were many such appointments, among which were those inTazewell,McLean,Iriquois,Coles,Menard, Wayne,Washington,Fayette, &c.; and we did not learn that there wasoneinstance in which a whig candidate for the legislature had been appointed.  There\n               was no written evidence before us, showing us at whattimethose appointments were made; but Mr. Wilton stated that they all, with one exception,\n               were made before those appointed became candidates for the legislature; and the letters,\n               &c. recommending them all bear date before, and most of them long before those appointed\n               were publicly announced as candidates. We give the foregoing naked facts, and draw no conclusions from them.3",

        "text": "2Wilton, a Democrat, was removed from his position by incoming Whig presidentWilliam Henry Harrisonin April 1841. In December 1840, the Springfield Whig newspaper, the Sangamo Journal,\n                  had accused Wilton of having used his federal office for political purposes. In May\n                  1841, following his removal, the Sangamo Journal repeated the accusation, specifying\n                  that Wilton had appointed as census-takers an inordinate number of men who were at\n                  that time, or who would soon become, Democratic candidates for theIllinois General Assembly, thus  allowing Democratic candidates to receive payment by the federal government\n                  while canvassing their prospective voters. On June 10, Wilton responded to the Journal,\n                  denouncing the accusations and offering up his records for inspection by a committee\n                  of Whigs.Sangamo Journal(Springfield, IL), 11 December 1840, 2:2; 7 May 1841, 2:3; 18 June 1841, 2:3."
