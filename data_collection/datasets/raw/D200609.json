By early April 1849, various Whigs were pressing him to enter the competition\n                  for the position. Lincoln responded to these solicitations by reiterating his support\n                  for Edwards, but he also consented to entering the competition if Edwards and Morrison\n                  could not agree among themselves which of them should withdraw and which should move\n                  forward as a candidate. By late April 1849, Lincoln still refused to enter the competition.Edward D. Baker and Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Ewing;Anson G. Henry and Others to Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln to William B.
