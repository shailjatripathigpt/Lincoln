        "text": "3From the  onset of the republic, there had been two conflicting views about the disposal\n                  of public lands.  The first view, espoused byAlexander Hamiltonand favored by eastern states, was that the federal government should retain the\n                  public domain and pledge it toward retiring the revolutionary war debt and paying\n                  government expenses by extracting all possible income from it.Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, believed that the civic life of the republic would be better\n                  served by making the land available to farmer-owners at little cost, a view embraced\n                  by those clamoring for land in the west.  Out of necessity, Hamilton’s view prevailed\n                  before and immediately after theWar of 1812.  The price of land varied between $1.00 and $2.00 per acre until 1820, when legislation\n                  set the minimum price at $1.25 per acre.  Even this comparatively low price was too\n                  much for some frontiersmen, and their solution was to squat on public land, improve\n                  it, and raise a crop or two to make their payments before they were discovered.  Squatters\n                  wanted protection against speculators who might try to buy their tracts; they also\n                  wanted legal recognition of their right to preemption--a prior right to purchase their\n                  claim at a minimum price before auction.Congresspassed a number of preemption acts, and in September 1841, squatters and western\n                  states scored a major victory with the passage of the Distribution-Preemption Act.\n                  This legislation sanctioned squatterism, allowing settlers to stake claims on surveyed\n                  federal lands before sale and, at the time of auction, purchase a minimum of 160 acres\n                  at $1.25 per acre.  The act further provided thatOhio,Indiana,Illinois,Alabama,Missouri,Michigan,Louisiana,Arkansas,Mississippi, and any other state thereafter admitted to the Union would receive 10% of the proceeds\n                  of the sale of public lands in their respective states.  Sections eight and nine granted\n                  each of the states 500,000 acres of federal land, stipulating that the proceeds from\n                  the sale of these lands was to go toward public works.  In 1862, the Homestead Act\n                  further opened land to settlers, giving land free to settlers who agreed to live on\n                  and improve tracts of 160 acres for five years.  The federal government also made\n                  further grants to states totaling over 300 million acres.Paul W. Gates, “Public Domain,”Dictionary of American Historyrev. ed.
