Edwardsto collect some debts for them inIllinois.  Oldham and Hemingway claimed that Lincoln, Edwards, and George B. Kinkead (who\n                  was acting as Lincoln's attorney in Lexington) failed to pay them $472.54.  In June\n                  1853, Oldham and Hemingway sued Lincoln and others in a chancery action in the Fayette\n                  County Circuit Court to recover the debt.  In February 1854, after depositions Lincoln\n                  took supported his version of events, Oldham and Hemingway dismissed the case.Lincoln wrote Kinkead aletterin May 1853, enclosing adocumentresponding to the claims Oldham and Hemingway made against him.
