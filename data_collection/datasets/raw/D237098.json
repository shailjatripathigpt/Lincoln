        "text": "2The documents that Lincoln discusses here were related to the case ofPowell v. Ament & Beer, which involved a dispute over the ownership of land inAdams County, Illinois. The case commenced in theU.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinoisin January 1858, with Lincoln representing the plaintiff and Jackson Grimshaw as\n                  an attorney for the defendants. At issue in the case was title to property which had\n                  originally been military bounty land patented byJabez Morseand whichJeremiah Evartsclaimed to have purchased from Morse, apparently through land agentsMoore, Morton & Company. Lincoln’s client claimed ownership originating in Evarts’ supposed title to the\n                  property, and the defendants traced their title through transactions that originated\n                  with Morse’s heirs. Lincoln had previouslysentGrimshaw a proposed agreement in the case, which Grimshawreturnedwith the supplemental stipulation mentioned here, as well as a copy of a certified\n                  copy of a deed as evidence related to the supplemental stipulation. Neither the deed\n                  that Lincoln returned here nor the agreement in the case mentioned has been located,\n                  but Grimshaw summarized what stipulations relative to the above facts of the case had been agreed upon by\n                  both sides in a letter he wrote to Lincoln on behalf of the firm ofWilliams, Grimsahw & Williamslater in the course of the lawsuit. Based on Grimshaw’s summary, the certified copy\n                  of a deed returned here was likely one that purported to convey the land in question\n                  fromCyrus Trueto defendantAnson C. Ament, with True having purchased from Morse’s heirs. Neither the deed nor the agreement\n                  was apparently ever filed in the case. Lincoln’s involvement in the case ended about\n                  1860. After three trials, the case was ultimately decided in 1863 in favor of the\n                  plaintiff.Powell v.
