Herrickin January 1849, Lincoln indicated that he had not pledged himself to any candidate,\n                  and was uncertain how to advise any of them.Davis himself wrote Lincoln several other letters regarding his application, urging\n                  Lincoln to respond whether he had received the application materials and whether they\n                  had been forwarded to the proper department.  In aletterfrom Davis dated April 9, 1849, Lincoln endorsed it by writing “Ansd before written.”\n                  Lincoln’s answer, however, has not been found.  Lincoln did not respond to this and\n                  the  other letters.Davis received the appointment, serving as register from July 1849 until 1853.James M. Davis to Abraham Lincoln;James M.
