Lewis et al., which was tried in theSangamon County Circuit Courtbetween March 1855 and November 1856.In the case,Thomas Lewis, president of the Mechanics and Farmers Bank, deposited $51,500 in bonds withThomas H. Campbell, Illinois’ state auditor, in the fall of 1852 in exchange for circulating bank notes.\n                  On November 22, 1854, the bank closed for business, still owing funds to its depositors,\n                  stockholders, and possessors of its bank notes. On December 4, 1854, Campbell notified\n                  Lewis that he had received a complaint that a $1.00 bank note had not been paid. Campbell\n                  retained Lincoln,Antrim Campbell, Benjamin S. Edwards, andWilliam H. Herndon, and sued Lewis and the bank’s other stockholders to petition the court to appoint\n                  a receiver to take control of the bank’s assets. Judge David Davis appointed Stuart\n                  receiver for the bank. After reviewing the bank’s financial records, Stuart reported\n                  that the bank possessed $70,882.29 in assets which could be divided among its creditors.\n                  Stuart worked toward reconciling accounts between the bank and its creditors well\n                  into 1858.Letter, Document ID: 76567,Campbell v.
