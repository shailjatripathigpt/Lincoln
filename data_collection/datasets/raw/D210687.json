        "text": "3Ray is referencing an 1845 act of theIllinois General Assemblyrelated to the funding and completion of theIllinois and Michigan Canal. Section five of the act stipulates that “The preliminary expenses of the negotiation\n                  of said contract with the expenses of the examinations of the canal property by the\n                  agents appointed by the authority of the bond-holders shall be first paid by the said\n                  trustees unless some other provision for their payment be made by the General Assembly.”New Yorkbanker David Leavitt maintained that he was owed a commission of $40,000 for work\n                  he claimed to have done to help secure a loan of $1,600,000 for the canal. In his\n                  capacity as a member of theBoard of Trustees of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, Ray had introduced a resolution in October of 1857 authorizing payment of this sum,\n                  which Leavitt, also a trustee, had signed. Leavitt and Ray argued that their signatures\n                  on the resolution constituted the approval of a majority of the three-person Board\n                  of Trustees, and Leavitt, the board treasurer, charged the $40,000 to his treasurer’s\n                  report for 1857. The remaining member of the Board of Trustees,William H. Swift, protested, and the canal’s bondholders inEngland, directed their agent in the United States to file suit in the Massachusetts Supreme\n                  Judicial Court to recover the money from Leavitt. Leavitt was ultimately allowed $10,000\n                  of the sum he had claimed, and was ordered in 1863 to repay $32,063.90 plus court\n                  costs.“An Act Supplemental to ‘An Act to Provide for the Completion of the Illinois and\n                     Michigan Canal, and for the Payment of the Canal Debt,’ Approved, February 21st, One\n                     Thousand Eight Hundred and Forty-Three,” 1 March 1845,Laws of Illinois(1845),      31-32;The New-York Times(New York), 31 December 1879, 5:6; Illinois HouseJournal. 1863. 23rd G.

        "text": "5In aletterto Lincoln dated April 19, 1858,John Wentworthhad conveyed a report that one of theRepublicanmembers of theU.S. CongressfromIllinoishad written a letter encouraging Illinois Republicans to supportStephen A. Douglas’ bid for reelection to theU.S. Senatein1858. This rumor circulated among Illinois Republicans, including at a meeting of party\n                  leaders inSpringfieldon April 21, 1858 at which both Lincoln and Ray were present, and Elihu B. Washburne\n                  was alleged to be the author of the controversial letter.LincolnwroteWashburne regarding the rumor on April 26, assuring Washburne that although suspicion\n                  centered on him, Lincoln was confident the matter was a misunderstanding. The letter\n                  in question had been written by Washburne toCharles L. Wilsonon April 12, 1858. In it, Washburne wrote that in light of Douglas’ differences with\n                  theDemocratic Partyover his criticism of theLecompton Constitution, Washburne would consider welcoming Douglas as an ally to the Republican Party, but\n                  that Lincoln must be the Republican Party’s candidate for the U.S. Senate in Illinois\n                  in theelection of 1858. Washburne responded to Lincoln onMay 2, denying the rumor, then wrote again onMay 6, enclosing the letter in controversy for Lincoln to peruse himself.Ray implicated Samuel L. Baker in the controversy in a letter he wrote Washburne\n                  in which he alleged that Wilson had shown Washburnes’s April 12 letter to Baker, who\n                  had promptly told Wentworth about it. Another correspondent informed Washburne that\n                  Ray and George T. Brown of theAlton Courierwere among those who had been agitated over the rumor.Russell K.
