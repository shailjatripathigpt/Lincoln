Douglas had commenced his reelection campaign with a speech inChicagoon July 9, 1858, and Lincoln followed with a speech in Chicago on July 10.In hisletterto Lincoln of the preceding day, John Mathers offered advice on the1858 U.S. Senate racein Illinois, and having acquainted himself with both Douglas’ and Lincoln’s recent\n                  Chicago speeches, Mathers encouraged Lincoln to attack Douglas offensively in his\n                  speeches in future, rather than speaking defensively. Several other correspondents\n                  wrote to Lincoln during the campaign of 1858 offering similar advice for his speeches\n                  and debates with Douglas.Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:457-58, 467-72; Robert W.\n                     Johannsen, ed.,The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858(New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), 22-36; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois; Report of Speech at Chicago, Illinois;John Trible to Abraham Lincoln; Johnson H.
