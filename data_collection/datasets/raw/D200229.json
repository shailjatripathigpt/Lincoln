        "text": "1Abraham Lincoln wrote the resolution in its entiretyOn November 28, 1840, Lincoln  introduced the resolution in the House of Representatives.\n                  The same day,John A. McClernandproposed to amend the resolution by striking out  everything after “Resolved” and\n                  inserting text in lieu thereof. McClernand’s amended text referred those portions\n                  of the Governor’s message related to election fraud to a joint select committee, consisting\n                  of three members of theSenateand five members of the House. In the subsequentdebate,  Lincoln questioned McClernand’s motives in offering the amendment.  The House approved\n                  the amendment by a vote of 48 yeas to 40 nays, with Lincoln voting nay. The House\n                  then passed the resolution as amended by a vote of 51 yeas to 33 nays, with Lincoln\n                  voting nay. The Senate adopted the resolution on November 30, by a vote of 34 yeas\n                  to 3 nays.Illinois HouseJournal. 1840. 12th G. A.,  34-35, 43; Illinois SenateJournal. 1840. 12th G.
