Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisereawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support ofanti-Nebraskacandidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for theIllinois General Assembly(albeit unwillingly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax, Lincoln’s\n                  name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats.\n                  In November and December 1854, Lincoln wrote confidential letters to political allies\n                  seeking support for his candidacy and information about his prospects.\n                  Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.David Herbert Donald,Lincoln(New York: Touchstone, 1995), 167-73;William H.

He wrote, “So far as\n                  I am concerned, there must be something wrong about U.S. Senator, at Chicago– My most\n                  intimate friends there do not answer my letters; and I can not get a word from them–”Scammon and Lincoln were among the candidates when the General Assembly met in joint\n                  session on February 8, 1855, to elect a U.S. Senator.  Neither Lincoln nor Scammon\n                  won the seat; the General Assembly selected anti-NebraskaDemocratLyman Trumbullinstead.
