Named administrator of Duncan’s estate after the latter’s death, Thomas spent much\n                  of the 1840s attempting to resolve debts Duncan incurred by becoming a surety for\n                  his brother-in-lawWilliam Linn.Stephen T. Logandefended Duncan and Linn in the case in theU.S. Circuit Court, and he also appealed the case on their behalf before theU.S. Supreme Court.Elizabeth Duncan Putnam, “The Life and Services of Joseph Duncan, Governor of Illinois,\n                     1834-1838,”Transactions of the Illinois State Historical Society26 (1919), 176-77; Julia Duncan Kirby,Biographical Sketch of Joseph Duncan, Fifth Governor of Illinois(Chicago: Fergus, 1888), 63-64; William G.
