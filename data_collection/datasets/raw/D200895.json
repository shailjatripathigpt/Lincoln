        "text": "2Lincoln  references a strategy for winningIllinoisin thepresidential election of 1856.Republicansnominated John C. Fremont as their first presidential candidate, whileDemocratsnominated James Buchanan. TheAmerican Party, in its final participation in a presidential election, nominatedMillard Fillmore. The end of theWhig Partyand the rise of the American—or “Know-Nothing”—Party added a third-party element\n                  to the election. Lincoln and theRepublicansbelieved they could create an alliance with the American Party against theDemocratsover the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories, which the Democrats\n                  supported. James Berdanproposedto have ten of Illinois’ state electors  be agreed upon  by supporters of both Fillmore\n                  and Fremont, allowing the eleventh elector to be a supporter of either man. Then,\n                  “the 10 common Electors” would “accept their nominations with a pledge to cast the\n                  Electoral vote for Filmore or Fremont as the 11thname may receive on either ticket the highest vote.\n                  TheElectoral College, if the united opposition succeeded, would then consist of the ten individuals whose\n                  names were agreed upon, and of the highest name on the Buchanan Ticket: the 10 being\n                  fully and fairly instructed how to cast the vote.”Thomas F. Schwartz, “Lincoln, Form Letters, and Fillmore Men,”Illinois Historical Journal78 (Spring 1985), 68."

        "text": "5In September, Lincoln wrote to several of his connections asking for the names of\n                  Fillmore supporters. He then sent lithographed form letters to the names provided.\n                  The form letters informed the Fillmore supporters that every vote for their candidate\n                  in Illinois lessened his chance of becoming president.Lincoln and his fellow Republicans failed to convince Fillmore’s supporters to unite,\n                  allowing Democrats  to label their opponents as both nativists and worshippers of\n                  African Americans.  Lincoln’s prediction proved prophetic: Buchanan captured Illinois\n                  with 44.1 percent of the vote to 40.2 percent for Fremont and 15.7 for Fillmore, and\n                  Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore to become fifteenth president of the United\n                  States. Indeed, if the votes received by Fremont and Fillmore in Illinois had been\n                  combined, Buchanan’s vote would not have been sufficient to carry the state.

        "text": "6Lincoln wrote this line and Berdan’s address on this envelope.Although this envelope is coupled with the above letter in its respective repository,\n                  several clues indicate that the two are not a match. First, Lincoln identifies himself\n                  here as a member ofCongressand thus uses his franking privilege. However, Lincoln’s only congressional service\n                  spanned from 1847 to 1849 in the Thirtieth Congress. Second, the envelope postmark\n                  is dated June 20, twenty days before Lincoln wrote this letter. Third, the postmark\n                  is from Washington, DC, whereas this letter includes an address line from Springfield.\n                  Fourth, Berdan writes underneath the postmark that the letter was received on July\n                  17, whereas Berdan’sresponseto this letter to Lincoln was written on July 11. The letter or document that was\n                  originally contained within this envelope has not been identified.Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1996(Alexandria, VA: CQ Staff Directories, 1997), 1394-95."
