        "text": "2On August 19, approximately ninety delegates gathered atPeoria’s courthouse to endorse the nomination ofAbraham Lincolnfor aU.S. Senateseat at the1858 Illinois Republican Convention. The delegation also nominatedWilliam Kelloggfor theU.S. House of Representatives. Kellogg delivered a nomination speech before Lincoln spoke, and he also addressed\n                  the crowd for several hours after Lincoln delivered his speech.Lincoln was theRepublicancandidate from Illinois for theU.S. Senate. At this time theIllinois General Assemblyelected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate, thus the outcome of races\n                  for theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere of importance to Lincoln’s campaign. Lincoln campaigned extensively in Illinois\n                  in the summer and fall of 1858, delivering speeches and campaigning on behalf of Republican\n                  candidates for the General Assembly. He and his opponent, DemocratStephen A. Douglas, the incumbent, both focused their campaign efforts on the formerWhigstronghold of central Illinois, where the state legislative races were the closest.\n                  In local elections, Republicans gained a majority of the votes, but Pro-Douglas Democrats\n                  retained control of the General Assembly, and Douglas won reelection. See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Kellogg, the incumbent, retained his seat, defeatingJames W. Davidson, his Democratic challenger, with 52.8 percent of the voted compared to Davidson’s\n                  45.7 percent.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 21 August 1858, 2:5; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008),  1:457-61, 476-77, 513-14,\n                     546-47; Allen C.
