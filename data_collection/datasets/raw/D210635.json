        "text": "2Abraham Lincoln’s letter to Cook to which this is a response has not been located,\n                  but it was likely similar to others that Lincoln wrote in November and December of\n                  1854 to members of theIllinois General Assemblysoliciting their support for his potential candidacy forU.S. Senate.Passage of theKansas-Nebraska Actand its effective repeal of theMissouri Compromisehad reawakened Lincoln’s passion for politics, and he threw himself into thecongressional election campaignin the fall of 1854, crisscrossingIllinoisto deliver speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and in support of anti-Nebraska\n                  candidates. He even allowed himself to become a candidate for the Illinois General\n                  Assembly (albeit reluctantly at first). As the election campaign reached its climax,\n                  Lincoln’s name began to circulate as a possible nominee for one of the state’s U.S.\n                  Senate seats. Lincoln won election to theIllinois House of Representativesin the 1854 election, butdeclinedthe seat in late November in order to run for U.S. Senate.

        "text": "3The Illinois General Assembly met in a joint session on February 8, 1855, to make\n                  their selection for the U.S. Senate. Cook voted for anti-Nebraska DemocratLyman Trumbullin every round of  balloting. Lincoln received forty-five of the ninety-nine votes\n                  cast in the first round of voting, but as no candidate received a majority of votes,\n                  nine more rounds of balloting ensued. After the ninth vote, with his share of votes\n                  declining, Lincoln dropped out of contention and urged his remaining supporters to\n                  vote for Trumbull to ensure that an anti-Nebraska candidate would be elected. Trumbull\n                  was victorious in the tenth vote. See the1854 Federal Election.Illinois SenateJournal. 1855. 19th G. A., 242-55; Victor B.

        "text": "4Beginning in the 1840s, sarsaparilla-based medicines became increasingly popular in\n                  the United States, fueled in part by two competingNew Yorkpurveyors, both named Townsend. S. P. Townsend apparently sold his sarsaparilla first,\n                  followed by “Old Dr. Jacob Townsend” whom the former accused of being a puppet for\n                  investors who wanted to capitalize on the success of the Townsend name. The two brands\n                  advertised widely in the United States, often with competing ads side by side, making\n                  elaborate claims about the benefits of their own sarsaparilla and casting aspersions\n                  on the character of the rival Townsend and their product.Gerald Carson,One for a Man, Two for a Horse(Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961), 47;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle(NY), 26 January 1849, 1:5-6;The Louisville Morning Courier(KY), 21 August 1849, 1:3;Illinois Daily Journal(Springfield), 11 August 1849, 1:2; 10 January 1850, 2:4-5."
