        "text": "2In June 1858, theIllinois Republican ConventionnominatedAbraham Lincolnto challengeStephen A. Douglasfor theU.S. Senate. Lincoln wrote Douglas on July 24, 1858, inviting him to participate in a series\n                  of debates. With this invitation, Lincoln set the stage for what would become one\n                  of the most famous local political contests in U.S. history and a precursor to the1860 presidential election. Prior to theseven debatesbetween Lincoln and Douglas, Lincoln had already made sixty-three speeches in 1858,\n                  and Douglas claimed to have made 130. Douglas, the incumbent, was more widely known\n                  than Lincoln and had the numeric advantage of theDemocratsin theGeneral Assembly, which selected U.S. senators in those days. He also represented a divided party\n                  and faced a growing population in northernIllinoisthat was hostile to slavery. Lincoln, on the other hand, had the advantage of a unitedRepublicanparty, a growing antipathy toward slavery in thestate, and a reputation for integrity. Nevertheless, his views on racial issues were unpopular,\n                  as was his stand on theMexican War. The debates would highlight the fundamental differences in the men’s characters\n                  and focus on the main issues of the day, the expansion of slavery and racial equality.\n                  While the immediate effect of the debates was the reelection of Douglas, the long-term\n                  results were the opposite. Lincoln was catapulted to national prominence, allowing\n                  him to run for president in 1860, and Douglas’s campaign against Lincoln diminished\n                  his chances of future success.

        "text": "3The debates followed a format of one candidate speaking for an hour, followed by a\n                  one and a half hour response by the other candidate, and finally a half hour rebuttal\n                  by the first speaker. Douglas and Lincoln would alternate who spoke first, with Douglas\n                  speaking first at the odd numbered debates and Lincoln at the even. Douglas planned\n                  to lead off the first of seven debates, thus giving himself the advantage. Lincoln\n                  concluded  the second, fourth, and sixth debates, while Douglas concluded the  first,\n                  third, fifth, and seventh debates.Paul M.
