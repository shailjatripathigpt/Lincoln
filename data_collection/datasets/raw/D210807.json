In a veiled reference to the split in theDemocratic Partyinto pro-James Buchananand pro-Douglas factions over theLecompton Constitution, Douglas also invented a fictional third Buchanan/National Democratic candidate and\n                  accused Lincoln of  conspiring to sneak that candidate into the debates to  injure\n                  Douglas’s chances in the election. Douglas finally proposed having seven debates at\n                  one prominent point in seven of the nine congressional districts in the state, excluding\n                  the second (Chicago) and sixth (Springfield) districts, where the two had already effectively debated, with Douglas speaking\n                  at Chicago on July 9 and Lincoln answering on July 10, and with Douglas speaking at\n                  Springfield on July 17 and Lincoln answering the same day. Lincoln agreed to the following\n                  proposed locations:Freeport,Ottawa,Galesburg,Quincy,Alton,Jonesboro, andCharleston.Stephen A. Douglas to Abraham Lincoln;Stephen A.
