It is the most complete summary of his speech in Bath, Illinois, known to be extant.\n                  Lincoln agreed to speak in Bath on August 16 after members of the audience at his\n                  August 14 speech inHavana, Illinois, invited him.At the time, Lincoln was running as theIllinoisRepublican Party’s candidate to replace Stephen A. Douglas, theDemocraticincumbent, in theU.S. Senate. He and Douglas both canvassed the state throughout the summer and fall of 1858,\n                  delivering speeches in support of candidates for theIllinois General Assemblyin their respective parties. At the time, members of the General Assembly voted for\n                  and elected the state’s representatives in the U.S. Senate; therefore, the races for\n                  theIllinois House of RepresentativesandIllinois Senatewere highly relevant to the outcome of the state’s race for the U.S. Senate seat.\n                  See1858 Illinois Republican Convention;1858 Federal Election.Chicago Daily Press and Tribune(IL), 21 August 1858, 2:5;Report of Speech at Havana, Illinois; Michael Burlingame,Abraham Lincoln: A Life(Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 1:458; Allen C.

The votes of former members of\n                  theWhig Partyin central and southern Illinois were critical to the election, and Douglas hoped\n                  to link Clay to the doctrine of popular sovereignty as a way to convince former Whigs\n                  that he and Clay shared a common interest in keeping slavery out of national politics.Lincoln greatly admired Clay, whom he referred to  as “my beau ideal of a statesman.”\n                  He quoted Clay’s thoughts on slavery during the debates, emphasizing his agreement\n                  with Clay’s view of it as “a great evil” and an unfortunate inheritance from the nation’s\n                  forefathers that its citizens must contend with as best they could. When Douglas argued\n                  that anyone who desired slavery should have it, Lincoln said, Douglas was revealing\n                  himself as part of that class of men whom Clay said were “blowing out the moral lights\n                  around us.”Stephen Hansen and Paul Nygard, “Stephen A.
